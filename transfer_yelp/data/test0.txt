the $ _num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
sorry but i do n't get the rave reviews for this place .
the desserts were very bland .
the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry .
it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice .
once again , i have n't figured out why they change so much .
consistently slow .
even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent .
so nasty .
i hate mayonnaise .
my goodness it was so gross .
i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
went here for the first time to try something new ... bad idea .
expensive , lack luster burgers .
would not recommend .
the `` chicken '' strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips .
the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich .
fries are n't worth coming back .
now the service i experienced was bad .
i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
the chicken tenders did n't taste like chicken , wtf ?
so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda .
horrible !
crap fries , hard hamburger buns , burger tasted like crap !
i 'm so disappointed !
but service was horrible both times .
gross .
the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce .
sorry they closed so many stores .
the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever .
i wanted to like this place so badly .
charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
i just got a plain ole cup of joe .
so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $ _num_ .
had they informed me of the charge i would n't have waited .
that 's why they get the score i gave them .
if i could give them a zero star review i would !
however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely .
sorry not my style nor taste .
- oh and terrible tea !
they close earlier than posted hours .
i wish i could give zero stars .
i really really wish i could .
this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses .
you provided none of those services for our $ _num_ !
that leaves you no excuse .
all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off .
i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses .
how sick .
you do n't deserve any animals !
cons : a cockroach problem that has n't been fixed by the management company .
the interior is old and generally falling apart .
tl ; dr version at bottom .
this place is bad news !
still down btw ) .
quickly found out they like to close for `` breaks '' all day .
old managers always gave us discounts , but melissa refused .
which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
flat tires everywhere !
worst was when we had to break our lease early .
it was never done .
tl ; dr version : sketchy as hell !
if you do , make sure you get everything in writing !
these people will try to screw you over !
okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out .
the last months were the worst .
the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period .
you will find both in your apartment , without fail .
front office : customer service does n't exist here .
they are clueless .
there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment .
if i could give less than a star , i would .
maintenance is equally incompetent .
mission rock have done none of those things .
about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
this apartment community is horrific !
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
not impressed .
i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained .
village inn , home run inn .
i do not like anybody 's pan pizza in phoenix .
not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though .
i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza .
just not for me .
the crust was kinda gooey like .
they were really nice i just ca n't stand this kind of pizza .
however the atmosphere lacked , mainly because there were no tvs or music playing .
the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using .
pizzeria bianco - sit down joint .
no delivery option though !
too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back .
i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about .
it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out .
the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed .
defiantly not my favorite pie .
unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce .
the answer was none .
this place sucks .
we have been there _num_ times , with an attempted 3rd time .
1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .
wo n't go back .
also like all spinatos they are closed on monday .
the food was bland ... if you like spinatos , just avoid this location .
it 's not worth it .
friendly staff , but not overly helpful .
we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard .
the pizza sauce is also way too sweet .
it tasted more like a dessert some bites .
too sweet for me , but maybe you 're into that ?
pretty disappointed it did n't live up to the hype .
the sweet sauce was not that great either .
mozzarella had very little cheese flavor .
over priced , poor value .
first time i had a bad experience here .
server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted .
super annoying to find that out during the meal .
constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down .
really dissapointed wo n't go back .
however this was a huge disappointment .
italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added .
it was gross .
the flavoring was off .
very disappointing .
unfortunately , our experience did not live up to others ' experiences .
bad move !
the italian sausage and peppers , however , were fine .
`` , check took another _num_ minutes .
they updated their meatball sub and it is awful ?
we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
they do n't seem to care either .
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .
may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich .
it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy .
raise the price do not lower the standard of quality .
now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce .
this was not the case .
personally i 'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business .
great pizza but no wine or beer !
thats just not italian !
the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
and if i go , i 'll pay cash and sit at the bar .
i 've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year .
to my surprise , they were completely out of wings .
we never want to let a loyal customer down .
no contact what so ever .
bars must be a bad business for making money .
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?
i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers .
this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor .
my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane .
which is pretty bad since they 're not really ones to give negative feedback .
if you 're feeling lucky , go check it out .
v is for very , very , extra ordinary .
not extraordinary , kids - just ordinary .
i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places .
i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point .
but wait , what about the broth .
i ordered pho tai : the soup tasted salty , lacked depth i.e .
my pho was terrible .
just got off the plane and needed some lunch .
bottom line : disappointed !
worst experience ever .
customer service was bad .
the restaurant was dark and did n't even turn the lights on .
it was n't for the mood either , probably to save electric bills .
the water tasted bad , and worst of all , the food tasted horrible .
never going back .
pho tasted bland .
seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it .
it 's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe .
terrible service !
i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke .
went back today and the service was even worse .
i walked in and sat down at the only available table .
the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me .
i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins .
eventually , my pho was dropped off at my table .
i seriously do n't know how the place manages to pass health inspections .
what a disappointment .
do not , i repeat , do not waste your money at this place .
thankfully i did n't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible .
greasy layer of fatty broth .
pretty much a hole in the wall status but it was n't good .
the only plus was that the service was decent .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_ !
they only want your money at sea of green .
_num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in .
i hate this place now , and you should too .
what a terrible way to treat a customer .
they had one ... but not cheap at all !
the replacement was expensive .
one not so bad time does not make me loyal .
the older man there said it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ ?
that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run .
what a ridiculous thing to say .
very low integrity bike shop .
larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin .
afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal .
`` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
that 's why i 'm returning the bike . ''
i ( and apparently many other customers on yelp ) recommend shopping somewhere else .
this place is garbage !
worst sales experience ever !
edit : after reading more reviews it appears they do this often !
this was hands down the worst sushi i 've ever had .
my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside .
my husband 's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce .
seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination ... crazy fish .
i kinda really wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
not so good .
my boyfriend and i went there one night .
it was n't that the place was busy -- far from it .
overall , i would not return to this place .
should n't have bothered .
gross .
i placed a to-go order for my sick partner .
and then charged me nine dollars for it .
but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
expired in _num_ .
sub par sushi ( at best ) and terrible service !
big mistake .
he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
needless to say , we left the restaurant and will never return .
never again , crazy fish .
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
terrible .
ripoff !
pissed off and will never go back again !
no wonder you have no customers .
do n't waste your time or money .
i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables .
i think i 'm going to be sick .
they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car .
i went back , paid my $ _num_ and picked up my car .
he found nothing on my car to work on .
they quoted $ _num_ .
so they wanted to charge me another $ _num_ to fix this .
after they said it was fixed just a week prior .
i went back about six months later to just get an oil change .
for a dealership to tell him he did n't need work was amazing .
avoid this place !
you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics .
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
no nothing .
waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call .
that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly .
it 's a few weeks later and i have had no problems .
i 've experienced better , much better .
the prices are too high , the food is mediocre .
there are too many better lunch options in the area .
what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .
from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there .
probably never going there again .
i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it .
so disappointing ... .
they come in plenty of flavors like red , green , orange , etc .
it was fun then , but i got older , it wore on me .
with the summer heat , fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated .
i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley .
the loud music will probably never let you down however .
apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open .
being in this bar makes me feel dirty .
the music is always insanely loud ( and not even good , usually ) .
fat tuesday 's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave .
i 've never had the food but the drinks are so-so .
avoid .
and i should hate it .
the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
it 's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami .
but fat tuesday 's has it .
well , all fat tuesday 's besides this one .
whoever had that idea should be fired .
if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
i went here this past saturday and the place was packed .
somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place .
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
if he was trying to be funny , it did n't work .
the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer .
what a disappointment .
sadly , fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it .
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .
um , i 'm sorry ?
did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order ?
i wanted so badly to love this place .
it 's that bad .
not because of the alcohol in my drink , but because of the sugar .
it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink .
you do n't charge $ _num_ for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
the crawfish itself was small too .
i do n't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish .
i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment .
was actually there tonight .
it was so sugary that i did n't want it .
so lame it makes me laugh .
oh wait , not i 'm not .
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .
i will never ever , ever , ever , ever go here again .
when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info .
very poor service .
worst customer service i have ever received in a long time .
do n't waste your time .
absolutely no point .
horrible experience !
not prepared for world cup .
she said game would be over , before i would got food .
she said they did n't have enough time to prep food .
should have left but i did n't want to miss game .
and leave the single person with poor service !
if i could give a zero star i would .
verdict : i wo n't be back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
fortunately i caught myself and did n't fall onto their nasty floor .
i had n't even drank anything yet .
bull .
very disappointing .
do not go to this establishment .
hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again .
ick .
just ick .
they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking .
why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me .
like $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
outdated hotel for the price , room i was in was dirty .
the less than good - really low shower heads .
no extra blankets or pillows in the room .
* tub would not drain & remained half full !
unsatisfied !
this one is the worst we have ever stayed in .
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
no tv remote in the room .
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
i still have n't received it .
we were really disgusted !
the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund .
horrible place !
i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores .
okay despite everyone 's glowing reviews this place is absurd !
we left without making a purchase and i will not be back .
i hate that .
they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place .
but i ca n't get over the awful service .
i guess i 'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores .
_num_ ) absolutely no organization in the wine section .
ick .
_num_ ) the aisle are ridiculously tiny .
thank goodness the store was empty tonight .
_num_ ) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust !
it does n't take that much effort to clean up the store .
that just seems like a sin .
( cheaper than texas , not as cheap as cali . )
it 's not worth your time .
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store .
what a disaster this place is .
i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store .
the problem is , i was n't looking for beer .
immediately , i know something was wrong .
i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone .
never coming back here ; sketchy employees and overpriced beer .
seriously probably the worst corner store ever .
the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .
great selection of beer at reasonable prices , what 's not to love ?
i 'm dumb .
i apologized immediately .
he says nothing and does n't even acknowledge me .
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff .
my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll .
finally , after over a week , mike called me .
_num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me ... voice mail .
no call back whatsoever .
luckily , a competitor that did call back got the job .
they have n't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago .
do not use this company !
i have spent _num_ separate stays here .
i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish .
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
there was a police report on the seat .
the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened .
this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .
they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking .
what a horrible representation this person , william is for sheraton .
my experience here was terrible !
could have stayed at the w for that money !
rather not stay here again tho .
i was not very pleased with the quality of this hotel .
-the a/c is not good .
actually , i 'm sitting in a hilton room as i type this .
was the experience awful ?
am i staying during my next trip ?
would i stay here again if i had too ?
ordered room service , the food was cold .
wo n't stay there again .
sometimes it was difficult getting hot water in the showers .
the room instantly filled with an overwhelming smell of burning death .
then every _num_ minutes or so i would hear planes pass by right above .
do not stay in room _num_ or around there .
i find this appalling and ridiculous .
furthermore , i will never give priceline my business again either .
hotel is clean but extremely dated .
carpet is worn , wallpaper coming off the walls and bathrooms with minimal lighting .
this hotel has been a nightmare to deal with ... not calling back .
i was sorely disappointed .
at this point i have no further expectations .
i will not go back to this hotel again .
i was very disappointed .
i provided feedback after my stay via the automatic email that i received .
this hotel is tired , dingy , and in poor repair .
i might be back , hopefully the hotel will be updated .
the carpeting looked kind of dirty and it was musty smelling too .
breakfast was weird .
the wifi is horrible .
the air conditioner was noisy .
wall paper in the bathroom was ugly and looked cheap .
the air conditioner did n't work very well which is a problem in arizona .
you 'd have better luck finding gold then an ice machine here .
i left three messages without a call back .
our stay over the weekend here was horrible .
we were lied to on many occasion by different staff and they were rude .
nick at the front desk even started yelling at one of our friends .
it would not close all the way shut .
the gentleman was really apologetic and immediately gave me a new room .
does n't cleaning staff report this ?
i actually selected this location based on _num_ things : _num_ proximity to airport .
_num_ price _num_ gym .
their only weight machine was out of order .
the conference room was even out of order .
i could n't even connect in my room .
i reported this twice and nothing was done .
one girl just said , `` that stinks . ''
the breakfast is not a deal by booking in advance .
the front desk refused to assist .
first day at breakfast was horrible .
no clean tables .
there is water damage on the first floor so the rooms smell .
the overhead light in my room does n't work .
so not worth it .
worst sheraton in the country .
they recently renovated rooms but should have renovated management and staff .
rooms smell bad , are still dated .
food is horrible .
we catered for meeting and we would have done better going to mcdonald 's .
disgusting .
the sandwiches not so good .
recently , the ownership and menu changed and with it went everything else .
in addition , the service has gotten significantly slower .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
this will be my first _num_ star review .
well , i am disappointed to say the least .
took over an hour and _num_ minutes for my food .
everything was very chaotic and the wait times were absolutely ridiculous .
it was disgusting .
the potatoes were n't done .
the toast was burnt as well .
it was impossible to eat .
i was a regular until the new owners purchased the business .
another _num_ minutes for my coffee to arrive .
i was neglected from this point forward .
for $ _num_ there should be more food there .
veggie omelet - $ _num_ + $ _num_ for cheese .
this omelet is tasteless and has an oily feel in my mouth .
gross .
this came with a side of cold , soggy potatoes , also flavorless .
did all my appointments to get this .
the staff is rude and the dr. does not spend time with you .
i cant rate him he gets a _num_ in my book .
i read other reviews on him and all were bad .
they had no empathy for my pain if it was n't headache related .
it 's really quite sad that this is the business model they chose .
the first time i went to this place , i got a veggie yakisoba .
the second time i went i got a tofu veggie thing over rice .
i could not believe my ears lol .
almost no meat .
bulgogi was not well seasoned .
the food was bland and nasty .
was not worth the _num_ bucks .
would not go back again .
new ownership came , they changed the recipes so now it 's gone downhill .
i miss the old tokyo stop .
ordered the chicken katsu and it was not fresh .
for lunch , i had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs .
not to mention , the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland .
we both were very disappointed .
the food was terrible .
she took _num_ bites and was afraid to eat more .
this is not authentic japanese cuisine .
katsu is not katsu , fried chicken bits .
katsu sauce they offer is a plum sauce , horrible .
i would not recommend this place to friends .
no seasoning , no flavor .
the katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce .
absolutely the worst place i 've eaten in .
it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting .
too much carrot and overall , not worth the price you pay .
not going back to this place ever .
the pork slices were dry and bland .
not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up .
not a ramen stop by any means .
really not impressed .
very dry .
not appetizing .
and the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough .
i would give the ramen _num_ stars .
i had a bite of my wife 's yakisoba .
it was ok , not great .
maybe _num_ or _num_ stars .
you 're bound to be disappointed .
i had to call them _num_ hours later to see if it was done .
_num_ dollars to put the tires on !
i dropped my car off at _num_ to get tires and alignment .
no one bothered to help or track this guy down while i was waiting .
this guy was ridiculous .
worst service and experience ever !
initially quoted $ _num_ .
it ends up being _num_ .
if you can tell a little lie , you can tell a big lie .
customer service manager asks what the problem is .
total _num_ .
i also tell him my battery is dead .
_num_ days later i call @ 11am .
they did n't even call me .
i asked about my discounts , oh yeah !
i just want my car and pay it .
they hang me my key .
do n't even tell me where my car is .
get in , it does n't start .
they never replaced my battery .
i end up going to another garage for the battery .
awful awful awful .
do not reccomend it at all !
the worst people to let near your car !
they rip you off and to a terrible job !
only come here if you enjoy throwing your money away .
this place is in absolute joke !
avoid avoid avoid !
no big deal they forgot i guess .
do yourself a favor and avoid this shop at all costs .
i have no idea how to fix anything wrong with a car .
it was a cold , rainy day .
their customer service was terrible .
so i really just wanted to leave .
they got me the gas cap like _num_ mins later .
they did n't act professional at all .
by far the worst car service i 've ever had .
be prepared to stay for hours no matter what they tell you .
however , they never tell you what 's required and what is not .
they just try to suck money out of you .
i mean what kind of trash operating are they running ?
they are awful !
absolutely horrible , stay away if you can .
these guys honestly do not even deserve one star .
do not take your vehicle here even for an oil change .
they are the absolute worst .
i set foot in this store just once , and i never will again .
worst customer service ever .
in short they are crooks who will charge you money for unnecessary part replacement .
cost me a total of $ _num_ .
useless people .
you ca n't even talk to the mechanic unless you insist .
neither should anyone else .
go on their google reviews and see see how bad it is .
it 's pathetic !
i wish i could give them zero stars .
worst experience ever .
manager had no customer service skills and would n't even talk to me .
i was not told in the beginning that i needed _num_ tires .
which it had never done before .
they charged me $ _num_ and make my car worse .
do not go here !
worst service possible .
will there be a 3rd visit ?
when i get to the car , turns out my battery is dead .
i really wish i could give this location less than one star .
finally i was told it was there but they could n't find it .
i just felt that they really dropped the ball on this one .
worse mistake of my life .
took a whole week , ordered the wrong part .
i 'm pissed !
_num_ rating .
do n't even let them change your oil !
i had to call several times to get updates .
so i browse the store then go sit down .
glad they double checked , that 's why i give _num_ stars .
other than that it 's a total waste of time .
first off , two of the filets we ordered were not filets .
seriously , that 's just rude .
first off , i do n't complain to get free stuff .
she did n't offer a new filet .
there was _num_ of us so we ended up here one dead sunday afternoon .
the place was dead not a soul in site and dark as hell inside .
dont let that fool you though , she didnt move any faster .
their sandwiches are bad and over price .
on top of that , the service is very slow .
the service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty .
not very good overall , but pretty good for tempe .
i do n't like going to downtown tempe .
this place should be a museum not a steak house .
it tasted old and dusty .
as others have noted , this is a dark place .
another thing to realize is that it is huge .
prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling .
unfortunately , i 've been spoiled by better , more expensive steak restaurants .
the waiting area had shirts that you could buy .
my first side of spaghetti was bleh .
i added a small packet of sugar which made it more tolerable .
little over $ _num_ for two after tip .
a prime rib was substituted , and it was ok , but nothing special .
flavorless and dry .
ate way too much of it .
the menu prices have gone up significantly .
the food was mediocre at best .
it is a very hard way to cook a steak .
the rice was bad , just bad .
it was over cooked , mushy , and surprising , it was cold !
final thoughts - it is too inexpensive to call themselves a steakhouse .
the food , service and experience is worthless and the steak was sub-par .
the fried zucchini i ordered was also hard and tasted really bad .
one of the worst dining experiences that i 've had .
for a steakhouse , i was not impressed .
excuse me , is that how they wait tables here in az ?
he never mentioned that milk refills would be extra .
the bread was the only item all of us enjoyed .
horrible !
terrible !
do n't eat here !
though we intended to come for dinner , we never made it past appetizers .
anyway , the empanadas came super hard and over cooked .
this place should seriously be on kitchen nightmares .
monti 's used to be so good ... now it 's awful .
i wish they would bring back their old menu and food .
we stayed bad move !
i ordered the chicken marsala with a baked potato and mixed vegetables .
she ordered a hamburger with the works with fries and chicken noodle soup .
this place with such a long history it should be killer .
such a disappointing experience !
it was horrible to say the least .
but the food is really not that great .
i want to like it , but it 's really not that good .
it tasted fine , but not a $ _num_ dish .
unfortunately , we had a miserable experience .
the first thing to arrive at our table was our steak .
two waiters showed up with plates and put them down .
they left at high speed without any acknowledgement .
two bites into the salad , we were brought our steaks .
they obviously had been put under a warmer as they were overcooked .
we asked what was going on as we had been rushed all night long .
caesar salad and then an _num_ oz .
filet and baked potato ( also really small ) .
the steak was edible , but not delectable .
the food : this is the reason for the low rating .
she could not eat it .
somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish .
no biggie .
it took a good _num_ minutes to get our food .
good steak is hard to find , but bad steak can be gotten anywhere .
sadly , i wo n't be going back .
took it down the street and spent money , elsewhere .
took an out of town , corporate guest here tonight .
our poor waiter , though very nice , was not very attentive .
i do not blame him though .
another _num_ to get our appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip .
the spaghetti i ordered was was just meh , nothing fantastic .
i was very disappointed that the restaurant did n't live up to my expectations .
this place is just way too big .
food was terrible !
prime rib was rubbery and dry .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
service was poor .
the waiter and then manager were both rude .
food was terrible !
prime rib was rubbery and dry .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
service was poor .
the waiter and then manager were both rude .
so disappointed .
we had n't been to monti 's in quite awhile .
no ambiance at all other than the tin ceilings .
i did n't even get to go in and try the food or drinks .
it was an event day on mill which means parking sucks .
the service was only fair , at best .
waited _num_ min for food , as did several other tables .
offered _num_ % off of my steak only !
so , a $ _num_ comp on a $ _num_ bill .
we had a party of _num_ , so big check .
this was a mistake .
steak was not good , chewy , texas road house has a better steak .
some had incorrectly cooked steak .
needless to say , we will not be back .
the famous `` roman bread '' is nothing special .
it is not bad , it 's just not special any way .
on the bright side , the place is pretty cheap .
this was one of the worst dining experiences in a long time .
_num_ tray of food , _num_ tray of drinks and _num_ near misses .
i explained that the ratio was way off and he just said .
the entire meal was just ok .
the shrimp salad is so-so .
i was not impressed with the location .
the food was nothing special and the service was slow .
in addition , the restaurant was either really cold or really hot .
of the great places in tempe , this would not be a return visit .
something 's very wrong at monti 's .
regulars , most of whom were over _num_ .
there was a peach pit .
still hurts , but it 's only been a few days .
i 've seen better customer service at drive-through windows .
the room was not ready .
waiter did nothing but upsell your menu .
he was like a used car salesman .
by the time the sides came out the food was cold .
your guac had huge pieces of avocado that was n't seasoned .
everyone for the most part thought this was a horrific evening .
do not go here , it is awful .
worst steak in years !
i took family members and am now so embarrassed .
did n't seem to care .
way overpriced for an old run down business .
just returned from a disappointing meal .
my husband 's prime rib was also almost more fat than prime rib .
unfortunately , we wo n't be going back again .
i ordered sea bass but i was actually served tilapia .
three words : not worth it .
the bread was ok , my salad was ok , my meal was ok .
the service was terrible .
the waitress was incompetent .
or to know the very limited drinks list .
it was ridiculous .
clearly i expected better out of a restaurant with such a reputation .
the prime rib , ny and ribeye steaks were all cold and seriously undercooked .
sent the prime rib and ny back and they were replaced properly cooked .
not a good idea for a nye dinner service !
even over looking the price the quality was not there .
also the salad no longer included with the entre .
ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and grilled vegetables .
server did n't tell me that the grilled vegetables were just really salty broccoli .
the ribeye was cooked correctly but was thin , dry and tough .
the total for just me for the meal including tip was $ _num_ .
prime rib was tough and over cooked .
atmosphere is ok.
i will not be coming back because of the food .
had the bone in new york and it was cooked to perfection .
so why did i just give this place a _num_ star rating ?
because the service was terrible !
wish i have n't .
it was also fatty , chewy , and had no seasoning .
the server brought out a short rib .
_num_ min later he came back and said he has it wrong .
the baked potato , mashed potatoes , and clam chowder were descent .
the chipotle mac and cheese needed more cheese and the was too watery .
the table next to us also had similar problems .
the server seemed nice but he could n't get his act together .
but lunch was not good .
the food was not good .
just very disappointing all together .
it was so bad this is my first bad review i have ever wrote .
our waitress was slow but she was n't horrible it was a busy night .
the level of quality was less than i am used to .
i would not go back .
if i want steak i would go anywhere else .
always .
this place was awful from the get go .
my party all had n't arrived yet so we could n't be seated .
no one else is trying to eat at your restaurant !
gross .
skip it , and get a steak instead for the price .
my partner got the sirloin and said it was overcooked .
will not be returning .
my main complaint is the slow service and confusion on the server 's part .
i would n't recommend this place for large parties .
brought clients here and waiter reeked of cigarette smoke .
come on management no one wants smokers handling their food and drinks .
not impressed .
the unfortunate part of the evening was the rib eye steak .
the steak its self was very disappointing .
it was prepared well , just a poor quality of meat .
about _num_ % of the reason anyone goes here .
the steaks were awful .
absolutely , no seasoning .
the asparagus was not trimmed nor seasoned .
terrible .
simply awful !
sad ... very sad indeed .
overpriced bikes and bad service .
huge waste of time on these guys .
these get a well deserved _num_ star for terrible first impressions .
pancakes are from a packet mix , frozen packet homestyle potatoes meat was microwaved .
no forks , no thanks , nothing .
price - if you are a corporate customer , grab your wallet and run .
fast service .
portion sizes are a bit smaller here .
i waited _num_ minutes after the estimated delivery time and called .
wont be calling this place again .
the car ran rough .
i paid in total _num_ in parts and labor .
i filed a complaint with the bbb and my problem was never resolved .
he told me it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ for _num_ seconds of work ?
no thank you .
she then told me i was disturbing the other patients !
this was ridiculous !
the lady said it is standard to wait _num_ to _num_ 1/2 hours .
there is one doctor and they must schedule _num_ people for each time slot !
waited _num_ 1/2 hours just for the doctor to fill out a prescription refill .
ridiculous !
what the hell are you doing back there when your waiting room is packed ?
it 's not fair and its beyond inconsiderate !
this place is awful .
the waiting area is dirty and unappealing .
i left because of the fact that they were so rude .
she did n't know the answers to basic questions .
i would highly recommend driving further to tucson or surrounding areas .
i do n't trust the doctors or whoever runs this company .
honestly , the worst _num_ hours of my life .
it 's typical to wait a little bit , as doctors are very busy .
i went back into my room and the door opened a second later .
a few of my friends are staying here and i went to visit them .
everything about the hotel needs a complete update .
the tv did not really work good .
i think i could feel the springs in the mattress .
it just felt a little dirty to me .
this is a terrible hotel .
the internet is not free ( greedy ) .
the breakfast is not free ( ihop is next door , though ) .
the shuttle took _num_ minutes to get me from the airport .
the tv channels are limited .
save your money and go to a nicer place .
this hotel is as awful as it gets .
the room was $ _num_ !
it 's a rip-off .
cons : the key cards here are incredibly bad quality .
wifi is expensive .
not worth it .
gross !
talk about _num_ hotel that has n't had renovations !
i did n't want to stay and thank god it was only two nights .
that was the only plus !
i could n't believe my eyes !
not the best experience all around for this place .
not a great place to stay .
also wifi is not free .
so that was $ _num_ and a day wasted down the drain .
it was a complete waste of money .
i will not be going back .
i always feel rushed and the staff is typically rude .
they nail technicians have been really rough and it hurts !
i should n't dread getting pampered .
it took another _num_ minutes for them to be ready .
the manicure began to chip within _num_ hours of having it done .
i did not like this place .
they are fast like many have said , but you feel really rushed .
i tried to refuse saying i worried they 'd damage my natural nails .
lastly , i tried to refuse saying it would take too long .
i hate this place .
i wo n't go back .
they do n't care about you .
i would encourage you to seek service elsewhere .
prob one of the worst manicures i 've had .
and it 's been _num_ minutes and my nails are still wet ?
thats after we kept them under the fan forever bc they wouldnt dry .
the first few times i went there , it was just fine .
the manicure was rushed and sloppy and my pedicure is all over the place .
there is polish on the skin and not even full coverage on the nails .
sorry uni but i will not be back .
probably the worst nail salon i 've ever been to .
once was great , the second and most recent time was awful .
do n't go there , their work is inconsistent at best .
unfortunately , i was the one getting the manicure .
i arrived , checked in and was told to pick out my polish color .
i go to pay and tell them that my manicure was really short .
they tell me it 's because i did n't get polish on my nails .
so , apparently they rush you through the pedicures here too .
_num_ minutes is way too short for a pedicure .
i am dying to take a photo but feel like that might be inappropriate .
wo n't be back .
not satisfied at all !
worst .
i walk in _num_ minutes before my appointment .
i feel like i was n't greeted properly .
they told me to sign in and sit down .
and i sat there for _num_ minutes .
i gave em the `` _num_ min '' benefit of the doubt .
it was extremely painful and i felt like they were inconsiderate on my needs .
uneven paint .
i will not return to this salon .
i will not recommend this place .
do not waste your time and money !
if you value good customer service this is not the right place .
very rude nail techs !
waste of money , long wait time , and rude employees .
disappointed and not coming back .
i have requested not to have her because of this .
i was _num_ mins late the past _num_ times but seriously .
this just happened to me again today hence why i decided to write this .
i will not be going back .
beyond irritated does n't even begin to explain it .
if you choose to come here , you 've been warned .
i just had surgery for the third time .
bad business .
shame on you for taking advantage of my mom .
... ... okay now wait for the ultimate response from the waiter !
house of tricks was marginal at best .
the worst part was that there was no music or background noise at all .
with only _num_ other tables , it was very awkward all night .
the service , again was just ok.
our waiter was a bit too attentive .
overall , i 'd look elsewhere before going .
food was moderate and exceptionally overpriced .
my 25th birthday : a reason to celebrate .
it was explained to me as a roasted butternut squash soup .
no one ever said that it would be indian squash soup .
very similar to the taste of pho ( vietnamese noodle soup ) .
in fact , it tasted almost identical without the soup .
bland bland bland .
the couscous accompaniment tasted like nothing .
we were poorly mistaken .
all in all : a $ _num_ disaster .
side note : this menu is n't even seasonal .
nasty .
the food is n't stellar for how much it costs .
the menu was nothing special , typical phoenix restaurant choices .
they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm .
and my mashed potatoes were cold .
gf thinks the mussels were good though .
i had a terrible dining experience at house of tricks .
the last time i stopped in at hot was with clients for a lunch .
absolute disaster .
and it was late may so we could have used them .
not good in my book .
needless to say , i have n't been back .
complete disappointment .
slow service , the food tasted like last night 's leftovers .
have you never eaten at a good restaurant before ?
the atmosphere is very romantic and intimate .
so imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par .
for the quality of food we recieved , we were robbed .
do n't be fooled !
our choice should have been burger king for the service , if nothing else .
sorry , no disrespect to those who wear the crown ; - ) .
if you eat there do n't expect any `` wow '' from the food .
in this economy arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut .
not really .
we ordered three caesar salads and a bowl of soup , and our entrees .
apologized , and said he would comp the salads and cup of soup .
the wine was a $ _num_ bottle of wine they paid $ _num_ for .
he should have comped it , too .
that 's not enough anymore in this day and age .
it is unfortunate that it happens to anyone , but for us its unacceptable .
the owner tried to replace my jacket with a cheaper one .
anyways , my cold food was not that great and the experience really sucked .
we had the worse service there this past tuesday night .
added $ _num_ !
but , alas , i was disappointed .
a basket of cold bread was brought to us .
soup was lukewarm when it came , salad was good .
waiter does n't show up till we are done with this portion .
but the food was lukewarm when it was brought to us .
over all i would not recommend house of tricks to anyone .
it was mediocre at best .
this will go down in the anniversary dining book as should have gone elsewhere .
extremely limited vegetarian options .
bad service and food was just okay , not great by any means .
our waiter could n't have been more disinterested in showing any signs of friendliness !
i only ate the white meat part .
the risotto was not cooked properly , was borderline mushy .
no apologies from the waiter were offered !
i would not recommend house of tricks and will not go back there again .
the food ( salmon & short ribs ) was just okay .
there was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate .
not cheap either , $ _num_ for dinner with _num_ glasses of wine .
i ate there last weekend with a group of _num_ .
this is possibly the worst service i have experienced at a restaurant .
ok fine but no apology , no management anywhere to be seen .
just an excuse .
this restaurant is very expensive so to be treated like that was unacceptable .
we sit outside and the dinner takes over _num_ hours .
the first _num_ times i went and ate the beef .
the server took it back and _num_ minutes later returned it .
i visited house of tricks for a friday business lunch .
you want your check before that point , usually .
the dressing was ok but too little of it .
the chicken was dry .
i wo n't be back .
food was good but the service was the worst ive ever had .
$ _num_ more to be exact !
the problem is that it took what felt like forever to get our food .
had the filet and it was a little bland .
my salmon was very fishy .
that should have been the first bad sign .
no complimentary breadsticks or anything waiting for the food to come out .
seafood salad was extremely fishy - was not fresh seafood .
wrong .
fish was dry and either overlooked , or not fresh .
i realized this appetizer was going to be completely different , and it was .
the bison was sort of dry and the main flavor was salt .
i went last night with _num_ friends and the place was a ghost town .
our waiters and waitresses were slow and seemed to have no training .
if smoking bothers you avoid this place .
the food is so blah !
not worth it .
he wo n't go back .
we had very poor service .
the cocktails we had made by matt were awesome as always .
i 'm a total foodie ... see my reviews .
_num_ ) the over sauce everything !
ask for all sauces on the side !
we were not impressed with our dining experience last night .
she quickly walked away leaving us to clean up the mess .
the pork belly appetizer was just ok as was the butter fish .
attention to detail is sorely lacking .
my experience was poor .
i chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish .
the meat by the rib bone was not even cooked .
the fat by the rib bone was still gummy and white .
my friends orders a seafood dish with various small chunks of dried out seafood .
the decor and building were cheap .
boar was very appetizing .
not the same place at all .
shame was a favorite not anymore though .
sorry about the low tip !
food was excellent but service in the bar area was awful !
the _num_ bartenders sat at talked while we were sitting with empty drinks !
will not be back !
was very disappointed with our last visit .
the waiter was pleasant enough but not very attentive .
we were in great company so in no way was it a bad evening .
nor did they even care to return our call to discuss what had occurred .
this was my first time at this restaurant with my girlfriend .
it started off poorly with checking in with the hostess .
granted , this is a college town .
however , if i was the owner , first impressions matter .
however , the food quality does not meet the price they are charging .
i had the beef tenderloin with a bacon reduced sauce .
not prime meat !
the exhaust vent had loads of dust .
it misses the mark in many small ways .
i doubt prices will change .
it just needs a little better attention to details .
i probably wo n't go back again .
scallops were under cooked and fish of the day was over cooked .
also the gnocchi is fried .
menu was n't clear and they were n't very good .
my daughter and i had a _num_ pm reservation last night .
it was very cold so i asked for a different table .
my daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it .
we paid for that and it was just gone .
terrible terrible service .
i tried smoked salmon that was too dry for me .
disappointing experience ... not sure if i 'll be back .
they 've been open for far too long to continually have this same problem .
it was bland , not cooked properly and very underwhelming .
my boyfriend got the sirloin and it was dry and almost inedible .
the cut was bad and the sides were a joke .
had a horrible experience ... .
the waitress took forever to get to our table , about 10-15 minutes .
on top of that , my steak was not prepared right .
our waitress took _num_ minutes to take our order .
would not recommend !
dining was a disappointing experience in comparison .
it did n't set the best mood for the night .
it did n't make sense to me for a couple reasons .
if i go back , i will be sticking to the bar .
overall this place is overpriced for its not so exceptional quality and taste .
it has been some time since my last visit to hot .
not so much anymore .
the worst part for me was the service .
at one point i snapped at him because i had enough .
kinda sad it was so bad .
portion sizes are n't huge .
oh we also had a flourless chocolate brownie sundae .
service _num_ .
not when the cocktail and appetizer have n't even been served yet .
uh ... no thanks .
the server barely apologized .
raw , sewage , miserable !
i had the chicken for $ _num_ and it was ok .
it was a big year anniversary and we ca n't get it back .
i went here for my _num_ year wedding anniversary and was very disappointed .
my husband and i both left there feeling sick .
i will not be returning to this restaurant .
i got the worst food poisoning of my entire life .
we requested in indoor table and were quickly accommodated .
club sandwich was delicious , grilled chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless .
not rude or incompetent , just not attentive .
oh no , she said you 'd have to pay for it .
i said , you do nothing for a birthday ?
never going back .
the atmosphere outdoors was as others have stated fantastic .
the service and food was pretty marginal .
but we then waited nearly _num_ minutes for the entrees .
my short ribs were dry and my wife 's scallops were cold .
once finished we waited another _num_ minutes for the waiter to ask about deserts .
at this point we had been at the restaurant nearly _num_ hours .
what a disaster !
unbelievable .
the artichoke dip was cold and had no taste .
the bread pudding was heavy and tasteless .
i 'm not in a rush to get back .
terrible mother 's day .
rude service .
menu was awful and food was subpar .
drinks took a ridiculous amount of time .
what a disappointment .
horrible service .
meatloaf was n't so good .
would not recommend this place .
as per usual this was before drinks , tax and tip .
our bill for three was $ _num_ .
this felt really pricey for the house of tricks .
not sure if it is going downhill or just an off day .
_num_ of us were there for lunch .
somehow my order , hamburger , got lost .
not a big deal , it happens .
in addition to being well done , cold it was totally flavorless .
but , i guess shame on us for not asking .
she may have just been too embarrassed to come by .
service was fine , but food was pretty lackluster .
i ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side .
$ _num_ out the door for a very mediocre dinner .
not good !
will not return , bad service !
there are so many better places around mill .
the service is hit or miss .
stay away from the spicy margarita , that was really gross .
i know they always mess up my order and then over charge me .
i was seated quickly and my drink order was taken .
it was dry , tough and boring .
had the chicken sandwich , bread was stale .
sorely disappointed .
restaurant just does n't cut it anymore .
if given a choice for a tasty business lunch , look elsewhere .
i really like the clam chowder soup .
wow just saw this review of best and worst pizza 's to eat .
guess i wo n't be ordering that again .
if i could give this restaurant a negative rating i would .
we were repeat customers at this establishment , with no prior problems .
he was a gigantic asshole .
needless to say , i eventually gave up .
monday ... no call .
i called tuesday because i understand mondays suck .
no answer and the phone just rang and rang .
they may do great work but crappy customer service experience for me .
the parking is not that easy here , even if you arrived early .
they are counting on you to not go inside for the refund .
that 's why i think its shady .
for some reason , the pump would n't take my visa card .
painfully slow pump .
frustrating stop .
it failed to come on .
would n't boot at all .
they call me later that day to tell me to come pick it up .
we see you have windows _num_ ... we do n't support that .
problem fixed !
took me all of _num_ minutes .
excuse me ?
your business will not last until you improve your business model .
prices are very high and selection is very low .
this store is a poor excuse for a japanese market .
i was not that impressed .
did not buy anything as i did not see anything that i wanted .
absolutely absurd !
overall , i was really disappointed with their offerings .
awful , ca n't say too much more .
nearly empty shelves , poor , poor selection of goods .
they usually talk down to me and they are n't very helpful at all .
not worth it .
they are complete assholes .
buying pants from here is less reliable than goodwill .
the other shoe followed days later with the same cracking and splitting .
the others are rude as shit .
first of all , the service took way too long .
garbage .
unbelievable .
can i just say , i hate everything about this store .
they looked at me , and my stuff , like we were disgusting .
you only accept ugly clothes .
nope , i was n't even in the store .
i accidentally sold a pair of pants that my boyfriend did n't want sold .
he had the receipt , and the assistant manager said that would be okay .
this place is awful .
there service is snooty and horrible and almost everything is way over priced .
$ _num_ for a used t-shirt ?
no thank you .
selling can be a nightmare .
would that employee wear those items you 're selling ?
if not , then they likely wo n't take them .
come back later to a different employee , you might get a different result .
also , i have no idea why it took _num_ minutes .
it seemed very unprofessional to me .
i threw the coupon in the trash .
i very rarely find anything here that i like .
i 'm not really a fan of buffalo exchange .
this store did not have consignment store pricing .
it was decently priced and alot of it was super cute .
they have made the decision that you do not get bags .
this whole store was disappointing i guess .
as for selling stuff , the worst part is the staff .
bottom line , super disappointed all the way around .
complete waste of my time .
spent _num_ minutes driving there for them to accept _num_ things out of _num_ .
disappointed is the word i would use for this store .
i wish that i could give this location _num_ stars .
their clothing is tacky and trashy .
save yourself the high price tag and go to goodwill instead .
i was so disappointed that i drove all the way out here from mesa .
do n't waste your time getting ripped off here .
that 's _num_ % !
turns out they offered $ _num_ .
this store is crap .
also , do n't try to sell your clothes here .
these people are way too picky .
unfortunately not .
( thank god ) i like that they play hip hop on mill .
i hate the door staff .
i hate the bar staff .
i wish there were more people like him out there .
the floors were sticky and the whole bar smelled like rotten chicken wings .
it was a nightmare .
every thursday they have a wet t-shirt contest .
wrong answer !
hey those things are n't gon na pay for themselves !
what in the hell were we thinking by going here ?
i just want to get inside .
i ai n't going back .
that 's the only excuse you have for going to this place .
when you are that young , you simply do n't know any better .
$ _num_ cover on mill is never fun .
staff is n't always that friendly and drinks are n't usually that great .
thirsty thursday is the only thing going for this place .
a gas station with extremely watered down fuel .
this place is a hell hole .
i am really unhappy with the way the cut turned out .
i walk in a get a hello from the barber and that 's it .
so i sit down and grab a magazine .
turns out he does n't know much about football .
he does n't watch basketball .
it was n't a terrible haircut but definitely not what i was hoping for .
been here a couple of times thought i would write a review .
avoid the male barber with the black hair .
this is probably the worst barber shop .
after tracy 's left this place this place is going down .
also told customer `` stop lying '' .
there is many collision center in phoenix .
you do n't need any offensive language to your customer .
if people bring back their vehicle to you , do n't panic !
the repair took _num_ and a half month for a gas pump replacement .
after i payed them my money to fix the parts .
i drove it for _num_ minutes and the car still had problems .
after i paid them money to fix it ... .
some shady ass people i will no longer give them business .
until now that is .
to say i am disappointed is an understatement !
here 's where it goes bad .
still no call from jeremy either .
exclusive collision center is no longer in business people .
i only chose them because of the great reviews on yelp .
the passenger door has a ding in it even though it was supposedly replaced .
nope , still the same boring burgers .
i went here in november _num_ and was not impressed at all .
to me the guacamole is what does this place in .
i cant get over the use of frozen artificial guacamole .
the burgers are decent but could use a little improvement .
they just never have that juicy medium rare middle that i long for .
it 's not that i will never eat there .
i really do n't get what all the fuss is about .
there was really nothing special , nothing even average about the place .
but i do n't think i 'll be back .
no thanks .
but oh no , the burger nazi could n't leave it at that .
he just repeated exactly what he had said , this time even more defiantly .
forget it , i 'm never returning .
the food is tasty but eat it at your own risk ... .
i came here on a monday night around 9pm .
nothing too unique about the taste .
fries though were crispy and fried well .
the ambiance was pretty depressing .
this place is very affordable but the food is nothing special .
second , my dad makes better burgers .
you can find better , cheaper burgers at in-n-out .
it 's not like i was trying to skip out on him or anything .
the food was n't anything extraordinary .
you put your own toppings on , which were your standard toppings .
the fried zucchini were pretty good .
but the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre .
the first time i went , my order was wrong .
i had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon .
the cashier gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the cash only sign .
this place seems promising but ends up falling short .
the chuck box makes a good boring burger .
they fall short of their topping options .
the lettuce , tomato , onion , sauce , ect .
the do n't appreciate the value of fresh burger fixings .
sometimes you just have to be the odd ball out i guess .
the burgers are n't cooked to order .
the condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me .
i have no problem with old but dirty is a different story .
i will not be back .
i must be missing something ... just not my kind of place i guess .
too expensive for a regular burger .
everyone talked about this place and how great the burgers were .
in and out serves better burgers .
i think they like the idea of the place more then the actual food .
the guy checking us out was so rude .
nasty place , i will never go back .
i made a mistake coming here .
now i have no problem going into shit holes .
i really did n't want to touch anything it was that dirty .
talk about poor professionalism immediately called corporate and stepped outside and spoke to joe .
they did not fit him , so i wanted to return them .
this location leaves much to be desired though .

i wo n't be wasting my time and money here again .
the worst part is a hide behind honesty when their just full of crap .
customer service and attitude of employees is awful .
run do n't walk from this business !
dave says nope i 'm booked that week .
only after you saw this yelp review .
recently reverse gear in my transmission quit working .
this was not done at tri city .
not impressed with this company .
i will not be ordering from this dominos again .
driver had a really bad attitude .
i apologized for the mix up and she said nothing .
i would never have been so rude to a customer .
corporate and stores ca n't figure out what they 're doing communication wise ... .
nothing special just a pizza , some wings , and a brownie .
extremely disappointed .
in this case nope , nothing , just thanks anyways .
total ripoff !
will not be back .
after another _num_ mins passed we just chose to leave .
i am so frustrated and will never return .
you are nasty pete , especially here in tempe .
down boy , down !
disgusting all around .
possibly even insulting .
ps : and wtf is up with not taking credit cards ?
they charge extra for their bad tartar sauce .
avoid .
pete 's made me furious .
the fries were limp and greasy .
the onion in the onion rings were non-existent , all breading .
you 're better off going to long john silver 's .
the same approach is taken with their fish patties .
so bad i do n't even know where to start .
i checked the ratings on yelp before visiting this place .
it was disgusting .
it was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all .
came out to just under $ _num_ .
the shrimp were flat out awful .
fried fish should have a light batter .
in fact , nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use .
i saved the worst for part of the meal for last .
that stuff was awful .
then why is the food so expensive ?
it certainly is n't high quality .
it certainly is n't any good .
bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = _num_ star .
worst fish and chips i have ever had .
and their pete 's sauce sucks hard .
this location sucks balls .
the guy taking over was n't a doll either .
the shrimps i got here were over battered and overcooked , though .
bad food and bad service .
i did n't eat what i bought and i wo n't be going back .
long john silver 's looks like gold compared to this place .
upon arriving home i see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam .
i do n't imagine this food ages well .
what a waste .
its greasy and bland .
also the red sauce ... yeah it 's gross .
second , service is appalling !
why are they so damn rude ?
they also do n't accept credit cards , or debit cards .
so i had to try again another time , that was my first experience .
this place has got to be breaking alot of health codes .
just take your business elsewhere .
i 'm sorry but i definitely will not be coming back .
fried shrimp were very tough and tasteless .
did n't try the chicken or burgers and wo n't be back .
the downtown mesa location is like another restaurant .
it is almost false advertising to call this pete 's !
no messy fish sandwich ?
are you kidding me ?
that 's like no big mac at mcdonald 's !
please comment and follow me for more reviews !
not a fan at all of this place .
all we could do was laugh ... this place is a joke .
the fries were bland - totally tasteless .
last time i checked without customers a business will probably close .
this new breading is gross .
if it ai n't broken do n't fix it .
this place is what gives fast food a bad name .
the staff not nice .
did n't care for our square fish or the sauce .
both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night .
i do n't understand the appeal at all .
worst fish and chips in the valley !
this food was so nasty .
i got sick to my stomach .
all the bad reviews on this place i agree with .
gross beyond gross .
waited _num_ minutes at the the drive thru window for my food .
they sure did take my money within the first minute of pulling up though .
everything was bland and tasted like deep fried cardboard !
i 've never eaten here sober until last night .
i 'm at loss for words to really describe how terrible the food is .
just a here 's your order & having the window slammed .
the absolute worst `` fish '' and chips i have ever experienced .
fish sticks from the store were terrible -- no flavor at all .
and it took _num_ minutes for one order .
_num_ hour wait !
ridiculous wait !
no way !
the food was absolutely disgusting .
the fish and chips were soggy and tasted like they were microwaved .
the prices are ridiculous for the quality and quantity of food you are receiving .
to top it off the customer service is nonexistent .
do n't waste your money or time .
literally the worst place i 've ever eaten at for seafood .
the batter was worse than store bought fish sticks .
sadly , the fries were the best part .
around 9:00 am , i got a call from someone named sean .
upon having the car , oil changes takes a really long time .
that 's right , the actual dealer was better customer service than these people .
he gave me the list price .
i mentioned that i found the same car elsewhere for less .
he told me that i should buy it elsewhere .
he gave me a low price to trade my car in .
he is not someone i would have hired as a manger for my store .
he definately lost my business just by talking to him over the phone .
he is in no way professional .
i gave up and went home .
they lost a sale .
absolute hell .
*** trails is the walmart of head shops .
i would rate them zero stars if i could .
it wasnt busy , so i got in and out very fast .
my only _num_ complaints : my lettuce was white and brown .
not appetizing at all .
which to me is a no no .
the food was ok , a little pricey i think .
waited in line too long to order .
i checked my email and facebook and still no sandwich .
get back to the office which is only _num_ minutes away and dug in .
the turkey was bland and the bread soggy .
the place was quite small and a bit dingy feeling .
i did n't smell anything , which was surprising .
i was very disappointed .
the sandwich was absolutely flavorless !
this was not worth the money , not even close .
how sad is that !
i got an italian hoagie and the ingredients really were sub-par .
the garlic toast was also bland and over buttery soggy .
this one went to the trash .
first time trying this place not to happy .
there was no line and only a couple people sitting at tables .
sorry , this one 's a bit harsh for me !
customer service : poor .
working in the industry , i know these prices are ridiculous .
sadly , i 'll have to look elsewhere .
rip off much ?
it is not .
but $ _num_ for a single print is too much .
a ) drinks are extremely weak .
they give you tall glasses , but have very thin pours of liquor .
i was terribly bored my only visit here .
i immediately got a _num_ out , o , please ask me .
yes , i am giving this place _num_ darn star !
my phone was stolen there , seriously , why ?
they never returned my calls or offered to refund the money .
i would never in my life eat here .
completely outdated , old hotel .
very noisy .
it 's very close to airport , which equals noisy !
pillows are all flat and my a/c would n't stay on .
the walls are paper thin and it is noisy !
paper plates and plastic utensils .
do n't stay here unless you do n't like sleep .
first , there was poor communication with hotel about airport shuttle .
after lengthy wait , had to pay for cab .
upon arrival , found out the place is being remodeled .
the entire lobby is a disaster .
i asked for email confirmation stating this .
it 's a disaster .
not marriott standards ... or maybe it is .
marriott seems to be sliding while hilton is improving .
hot sweaty nights in phoenix as a result .
do n't stay here with small child .
two problems occurred when we stayed here with our _num_ month old .
there really is n't any excuse for not having a few more high chairs .
they checked me in quickly , and the place was clean .
total ripoff !
to add insult to injury , i was still starving when i left .
what a weak meal !
i 'll will never go back to this establishment again .
caffe boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day .
oh , yeah , i get it .
it ended up sitting there getting cold while we ate the salad .
remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail ?
there was nothing like it in tempe at the time .
the biggest complaint was that our service was awful .
we were n't dressed any more poorly than most of the people here .
and to add insult to injury , my drink was supposed to be flaming .
on my plate was a half order of salad and three ravioli .
i miss them all and want them back !
caffe boa used to have the best happy hour on mill .
the food tasted good , but man ... .
hard not to think that you 're getting taken for a ride here .
cafe boa appears to be an institution headed for disaster .
no sauce , just terrible .
all in all we ordered three bottles of wine ( for _num_ ! )
the bill came and only one of the bottles was 1/2 off .
clearly not our expectation .
wrong .
he simply said there was nothing `` more '' he could do .
for _num_ years caffe boa was my go to hh place .
now they have a handful of their worst ones .
i 've changed my rating from one star to two stars .
the wine list used to be incredible .
the prosciutto and melon is pretty weak , as is the cheese plate .
once again , i stand my my award winning wine list .
people like this are not the norm of course .
alas , you never called .
without you , i might have never found them .
having dined here many times before , the service is indeed usually much better .
the taste of basil is completely lost as is the balsamic vinegar .
not something we would recommend or order again .
they used to have several great salad options , now they only have three .
it looked like they have less pasta too .
it 's not like we took a long time to order .
when it finally came , my turkey sandwich was kinda blah .
even the red pepper mayo on it did n't add much life to it .
i want my old caffe boa back !
looking at the lunch menu i chose the meatball panini .
that 's when things went downhill .
can spaghetti be spaghetti without noodles ?
can a meatball panini be a meatball panini without meatballs ?
i think i 'll stick with defalco 's for my meatball sandwiches .
not even a water .
at this time , we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant .
and a bit pretentious .
to be honest , none of the food was worth the price tag .
caf boa you 've lost me .
i was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake .
i miss my old modest reliable boa .
i felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off .
no one !
this new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food .
case in point : a $ _num_ lunch special ?
does n't sound very special to me .
the food is just ok - rather average .
strange happy hour menu - deep fried pork belly fat .
really greasy and gross .
two glasses of sangria actually put me out for _num_ days .
some strange kind of concoction that i would n't wish on an enemy .
no thanks - i 'll go elsewhere .
one of the worst dining experiences ever !
i ordered _num_ courses with wine paired with each course .
although the duck was cooked correctly , the rest of this dish was inedible !
last but not least , there was the dessert course .
hands down the worst preparation of creme brulee i have ever encountered .
there was a about _num_ people in the whole place .
the gnocchi were over pan seared and filled with grease .
i could n't finish the dish .
sadly , i thought the service and food were terrible .
at those prices average does n't cut it in my book .
the menu is kind of limited .
this place sucks .
they were not stuffed full of seafood , they had some seafood .
you do not get what you pay for here .
total disappointment .
however , no one came to greet us .
she did n't apologize for the situation .
she just said she would find someone .
we eventually got the beer but no bread .
could he not have mentioned that before we had to ask again ?
i will not go there again .
the only good thing was the ambiance .
then all of the sudden , he did have the time .
we walk in and half the tables in the place are empty .
they 're trying to get your bill up with alcohol sales .
it was $ _num_ .
it was tiny , about _num_ small pieces , and tasted gross .
the sauce reminded me of salt and vinegar chips .
over priced , disgusting scam .
i no like .
gross .
bland !
so so so so so boring .
the lobster ravioli may be the most overpriced , overrated dish on the menu .
$ _num_ for _num_ tiny ravioli ?
what 's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab .
it was the worst thing on the table .
a half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch .
unfortunately , that was the highlight of our meal .
a few things pissed me off because i absolutely love this place for dinner .
the `` brunch '' food was ok although it was nothing special or memorable .
failed attempt at good cuisine .
only place in the city to get rabbit but very poorly done .
a waste .
not a good meal .
i mean honestly , $ _num_ for their `` special fries ?
$ _num_ for bruschetta ?
however , my visit over the weekend was less than good .
the server was really slow .
there was n't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu .
neither of us wanted to finish the dish .
had we just left it at that , our experience may have been better .
so why the low stars ?
so , i returned .
i will not go back .
honestly , i ate bread to fill myself up .
i brought some leftovers home ... you want some ? ''
i 'll miss it a bit ... some of the food was amazing .
i wanted to like this place , i really did .
however , at that point , it went downhill so fast .
but then , our waitress was noticeably absent most of the time .
forever to get the bill .
just absolutely terrible service .
the staff missed or got multiple orders wrong , some never came at all .
$ _num_ for an appetizer size bowl of soup is absurd .
$ _num_ for a basic caesar salad ?
the food was all good , but terribly overpriced .
would return for the food , but not at these prices .
not cool !
tonight has been completely unacceptable !
it took more than _num_ minutes to take our order .
after waiting about _num_ minutes we were seated directly inside the front door .
justin suggested the macarons for dessert -- they were incredible !
did we get free wine for our wait ?
_num_ minutes later there was still no bread and no supper .
being hungry , tired and frustrated we left .
so far , no call .
i still have the stupid groupon to use .
an hour later , we still had n't received it .
i probably would have enjoyed it more had the service been better .
food is acceptable , service is terrible .
however , do n't always expect to have their daily offered selections available .
i will not be going back here a 4th time .
really , caffe boa , you know better .
because it sure did n't show up for brunch today .
i am not sure who remembers that this place had an old location .
the new place ... meh , not so much .
nowhere near as cozy , its more like a corporate bar .
oh caffe boa , i do n't even know where to start !
i am very disappointed caffe boa !
we were seated and had to wait 5-10 minutes for anyone to approach us .
the food was good but not at all worth the expensive prices .
there are much better restaurants in the area like house of tricks .
food takes forever to arrive , bread not refilled nor water .
_num_ dollars + _num_ dollars for meat for my pasta dish .
_num_ dollar fries did not arrive either .
all in all a lack luster experience .
bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry .
no butter or jam was offered .
it was n't fresh squeezed .
no complaints there .
all in all everything was less than acceptable .
sadly i wo n't be back .
cafe boa was just okay but there are way better places out there .
we spent close to $ _num_ for subpar dinning .
i probably wont come back here .
and my girlfriend chose a pasta and a salad .
none of the ingredients matched what we read .
the food was good , but the service was lackluster at best .
better luck next time !
probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life .
i was so embarrassed we took others here , too .
so , we arrive , after making a reservation for _num_ .
_num_ of the group order a cocktail .
immediately after that , it came out .
it was somewhat dry .
it appears that you are supposed to get bread before you meal .
we did n't even get offered any .
i really can not say enough bad things about this place and our experience .
came here for lunch with a friend and was disappointed .
to me , here is where it got a bit frustrating .
the piece of chicken seemed to be well breaded and fried too long .
overall , she was not impressed with her meal .
ridiculous i say !
the waitress was a nightmare !
overall great food but horrible service that turned me off to go there again .
and at that time , it was unbelievably good in every way .
i have been here twice and my main meals were terrible .
dry and flavorless , blah .
i said nope just a foodie who experienced terrible service and food .
it was worse than the first time .
no bread , no water .
not sure the hype here .
maybe both my times were bad ?
no , i do n't think so .
they must not taste their own food .
dry , flavorless , under seasoned and boring after the 3rd bite .
no thanks people .
i will never return to this place .
slow service , food was bland , and was way overpriced .
the only reason this place gets _num_ stars is because of the interior .
unfortunately for $ _num_ this left me hungry and craving some flavor .
there are better options in neighboring scottsdale or even in tempe .
skip this place .
sorry , boa .
what a waste of time and money .
cafe boa used to be a great place to dine .
im not sure why they even open the doors anymore ?
the f word !
i would n't waste a penny more on this old has been !
the problem was the waitress .
but the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us .
we did n't even get any waters or the chance to flag her down .
just returned from my last visit to cafe boa .
i sit down to a filthy , paper menu .
not so good .
she brings my tea and _num_ packages of sugar .
next i order a salmon caesar salad .
it arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless .
i wo n't go there again .
if you 're a vegetarian , skip dinner .
just removing the meat does n't make a dish appealing .
tonight i went here for dinner on a date .
the restaurant was relatively empty - sunday night at _num_ .
i ordered the mushroom ravioli that was very undercooked .
there was no offer to make it right .
she just cleared the plate and offered the dessert menu .
her lack of concern was surprising .
this was not my first disappointing experience at this restaurant at this location .
hands down worst service i have ever had a restaurant .
she was very rude about it .
$ _num_ and no croutons .
and this place will not give you a piece of regular italian bread .
bread to scoop up all that sauce ?
nope , you ca n't get it at this place .
but you ca n't get a piece of freaking italian bread .
went to cafe boa the evening of march 3rd , _num_ .
however we waited almost _num_ mins to get our food .
the manager was totally unprofessional .
rip off !
i ordered their turkey sandwich , which was $ _num_ .
total rip off !
i am not exaggerating .
not too professional .
do n't order a half meal of ravioli and salad .
did you know there 's only _num_ ravioli in the full order ?
other than that , was not very impressed at all .
the menu looked impressive but the end food result was very lacking .
i do n't like paying for an expensive meal that is not good .
the $ _num_ salad i ordered was tiny and extremely bland .
even the $ _num_ peach appetizer just was n't good either .
the prosciutto did not taste right .
i just assumed that all business do that for their customers .
i was wrong .
cafe boa does not validate parking .
however , their service is truly terrible .
needless to say , reservation canceled only _num_ hours before the party !
we visited cafe boa on saturday night with a 7:30 reservation .
our experience was so disappointing on many levels .
today 's adventure was their rueben ... it was almost totally inedible .
do not bother coming here .
but the food , for the most part , is not .
not good .
worse yet , service was pleasant but very very slow .
horrible experience !
the dinner was ok , nothing special and was small in portion .
first , i brought cup cakes , they were not cut .
butter lettuce , walnuts literally that 's it with salmon .
probably wo n't eat there again .
i went here on saturday night for a friend 's birthday dinner .
it was very disappointing .
the fries were okay , though some were covered in chili powder .
we tried to find her , but we could n't see her anywhere .
she essentially gave herself a $ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ bill twice .
the food is fancy but is n't worth the price .
terrible .
very strange experience .
okay , anthony did n't tell me the specials nor the soup .
no water .
i would n't have ordered it if i knew it had meat .
anyway , bill comes & there 's a $ _num_ charge for the wine .
no one is here anthony says .
no one is ever here this early .
food was nothing special , even though they tried .
it sadly was not the experience i expected for a brunch .
and really , who is n't pretty easy when it comes to a mimosa ?
sour taste ( pun ? )
still exists from this delay and poor customer service .
if you like leaving a restaurant unsatisfied , this is the place .
the place was cold and the service was terrible .
the meal was small and unimpressive for the price .
if like leaving a restaurant unsatisfied , this is your place .
the restaurant was cold , the service was lousy and portions were small .
the food was unimpressive for the price .
disappointed we stopped by .
i assume that was to split the plates .
i wish restaurants could understand that .
the chef obviously does n't know how to be innovative with vegetables .
not one more piece of bread without paying for it !
no bread , no goodwill .
sorry , it 's been sitting around too long .
it 's such a pretty atmosphere ; too bad it 's gone lame .
might as well just shoot it .
she said no problem and that they cater to the theater crowd .
ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time when she brought our drinks .
did n't see our cheese and meat board for _num_ min .
he did however refund $ _num_ per bill .
do n't go here for a large party .
_num_ hours after we ordered to get out food .
took _num_ minutes to figure out bills .
staff was unprofessional and not based on satisfying customers .
b - `` which one ? ''
this is a $ _num_ salad and i did n't enjoy it much .
if i could give half of a star , i would .
no flavor .
very dry .
their service , unfortunately , leaves much to be desired .
`` unfortunately , we do n't have anything available . ''
if you watch carefully you will see that it is all fake .
this place is bad .
my mom asks my dad and i `` is he leaving the bottle ?
strong fish is n't supposed to be good .
esp salmon , it should never taste that way .
the bill comes and that bottle of wine was $ _num_ .
never going back and will spread the word .
now do n't get me wrong , i like thai basil .
i ca n't ever seem to get enough , and i really mean that .
service is hit or miss here .
one thing that 's consistent : they always seem to be understaffed .
to me , thai basil is style over substance .
not impressed .
one thing that 's consistent : they always seem to be understaffed .
i 've canceled the order and walked out .
too many other choices to spend my money .
$ _num_ green curry w/ chicken called my name .
veggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl .
took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix .
curry sauce was good , but looked too watery and not silky enough .
then we had rama 's favorite , which was basically beef with peanut sauce .
more like peanut butter -- the peanut was overpowering .
i even had to bring him to the er , it was so bad .
ok , i have only been here one time .
i asked my waiter how it was prepared .
waiter : `` well , mostly sour sauce . ''
`` no , not really . ''
the amount of fish was disappointing .
the sauce was below average .
there do n't seem to be many thai restaurants in the area .
the place is not set up for relaxed dining .
not the best thai place .
skip the pad thai ( worst i 've ever had . )
why only _num_ stars you are most likely wondering .
thai basil lacks a lot of flavor because everything was so watered down .
i asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai .
this was not the case here .
so freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food .
and this was _num_ reviews in one .
gross , i know .
got the veggie soup , it was salty and very peppery .
from the outside , not too shabby .
on entering , i saw _num_ tables seated .
i advised water would be great .
as i waited , i looked around the restaurant .
the salad and rice were presented to me in about _num_ minutes .
i figure i actually had about _num_ 1/2 cups of papaya salad .
disappointing since i ordered thai hot _num_ .
all the lettuce underneath was a disappointment .
rice was wrong , overcooked to nearly mush .
the food is not impressive .
they will not make my food spicy .
i could n't eat it .
worst thai food i 've had -- nearly inedible .
small menu , no spice rack .
drunken noodles did n't even taste like the right dish .
ordered pad thai chicken med spicy .
the portions are too big could have easily split it .
it was dry and really spicy for medium .
disappointed for sure .
i will not go back .
this place is all about big mediocre portions .
if you want to eat real thai food ... go elsewhere .
no traditional thai spices available .
ill never return !
not sure why people like this place so much .
the servers are always rushing around and the place seems understaffed .
i 've eaten lots of thai food and this place is less then memorable .
very average food and horrible service .
worst experience ever at a restaurant .
their food is average however the way they run their business is awful .
when the bill came again , two things struck me : _num_ . )
it went from $ _num_ to $ _num_ ; _num_ . )
i was very disappointed with this place .
apparently here medium means they do n't even use any sauce .
dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what i received .
sorry you hate your job but i never made you work here .
they ripped us off during lunch .
for three people , no booze .
sorry but i still feel cheated .
i seriously hate this place because of food poisoning !
i was very wrong .
they just handed me the money and turned around .
the food was disappointing to say the least .
my dish was bland , service was n't great .
not worth the price .
the place was empty and the quality still was n't even close to par .
unfortunately , this carried over to my entree as well .
i would n't come back here though .
i feel like this place is on par to fast food .
i wo n't be coming back .
large , well run and stocked indian grocery store .
fried food , burgers , wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen .
everybody raves about this place .
just because a lot of people go there does n't make it amazing .
but , its impossible to get a table .
i agree with the poor reviews on this place .
i have found the food to be expensive and very boring .
the drinks are ok , the beer is ok , the atmosphere is ok .
however , i do n't , so i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
i have been here twice and both times sucked .
however , it is also highly , highly overrated .
for a real hole-in-the-wall , find a hole-in-the-wall .
we do n't know why this place has such a great reputation .
boring .
it 's just not that cool .
there 's also never any place to sit on a busy night .
dumb .
drinks are a bit over priced .
took all of _num_ seconds .
and the waitress did n't care .
and it was n't that good .
um ... stripper jumping out of a cake ?
or do you really not know how to spell desert ?
i really do n't get it .
it 's just plain bad .
patrons above the age of _num_ .
slow waitresses .
$ _num_ kiltlifter .
asshole cops that follow you home afterwards .
sorry , i just do .
the service is slow and the staff is generally pretty obnoxious .
otherwise , just head a few blocks away to four peaks .
it 's just a different type of obnoxious .
this place is for folks with too much to prove .
i do n't smoke cigarettes .
this place barely has an interior .
gross as hell .
i do n't get this place .
before we could even say anything , she had left .
only when she returned a third time did she finally ask us about food .
i 'm not sure how to describe them .
do n't waste your time here .
it 's a pain , and confusing .
not good .
music sucked , a bunch of shitty trendy crap .
the only thing redeeming were quality servers .
went to this place more then 3x 's never had a good experience here .
my friend gave the waitress his credit card to pay the bill .
my friend said , '' i gave you my credit card '' .
she said well , i do n't have it .
well _num_ hours later guess what ?
gave him a card for _num_ drinks next time .
believe me , there is no next time .
customer service does not exist here .
parking also can be difficult .
my last visit , however , really changed my perspective on this place .
it took over one and a half hours for us to get our entrees .
the balance of the whole sandwich was lost .
parking is rough and it 's a packed house especially on a saturday night .
first off i am _num_ , but no stick in the mud .
i write to save another business traveler the trouble of a horrible dining experience .
it is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer .
_num_ oysters .
_num_ of them bad from looking at them .
they look bad , they will taste worse .
horrible !
swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store .
everyone else stay far , far away .
i guess i could be in culinary hell here .
so bad in fact that i sent them back .
this place is constantly over crowded , and the staff is rude .
the second time i went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich .
so , this place was already two for two .
but the service was horrible .
but no .
but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
i could n't believe my ears !
i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before .
nothing special .
the people who own this business have no idea what they 've lost .
however , this is not the final straw for me .
so long casey moore 's .
maybe i order poorly , but my pasta was lame .
like i said , confusing !
the food was not impressive .
the fish was mediocre ... the batter was thin , not crispy at all .
it had no salt , flavor , or seasoning whatsoever .
the side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning .
the fries were limp and had absolutely no salt .
i was not impressed at all with the property or location .
like i mentioned before .
the service is not spectacular either .
i walked in and was greeted by no one .
this was my first visit and needless to say my last !
this was the worst place ever .
in my burger , there was some mystery meat that i bit .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
food , service , parking and decor are horrible .
the inside looks like a haunted house and the outside is a complete wreck .
i quickly paid my tab and got out of there .
it might have been because we did n't look like hipsters .
maybe we did n't have enough visible tattoos .
after our nice long wait for our food , the food was wrong .
our waitress was obviously bothered by our requests to get our food correct .
i forgot who ordered what but the sandwich was missing the bacon .
unless you have very low expectations of what a bar/restaurant should be .
but even then i think this place would disappoint .
total disappointment .
a total mess .
and apparently there is a bread shortage if you order clams or escargot .
the service here was absolutely horrible !
i arrived and it was fairly empty .
two waitresses split between _num_ people at _num_ tables .
by far the worst service i 've ever had at a restaurant .
ate the fried oysters , and some bbq wings .
oysters were pretty good this far out in the desert .
so needless to say the parking sucks .
if i could give zero stars i absolutely would .
i do n't eat chowder so i assured him i did n't .
btw , chowder , according to my boyfriend was terrible .
i asked them to remove the steak as i was done .
probably one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite .
if you tell anyone about what happened you 're not allowed back here .
i just can not say too many good things about this place .
it is busy all the time though so someone likes it .
looking back it has been here for at least _num_ years .
oyster house , i would not trust eating seafood here my friend .
just an old place that people like to drink at .
nothing to really brag about .
place is old and had a funky smell when you walk inside .
i would say this is more a local watering hole then a restaurant .
there are better places to go then here for oysters and other food .
it was my bad that i did n't count when i took it .
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times .
had the oysters , calamari , halibut and ahi .
i 'm not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary !
but no !
i wo n't go back since there are plenty of places with decent staff .
but the servers are not all that friendly .
i 'm hoping next time i come i 'll have a better experience .
the service was horrific .
honestly if the wings were n't so good i would n't go back .
the tables outside seemed dirty and the service was mediocre .
wo n't go back .
wish it had been my choice !
would we go back , i only know i would n't .
this review is long overdue .
maybe i 'm getting too old for this , but seriously ... .
my husband finished off the rest .
but this is my review , not his , so two it is .
i wo n't be back .
management says bartender made a `` judgement call '' .
management sucks .
skip this place and spend your hard earned bucks somewhere else .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
_num_ minutes to get our two orders of oyster rockefeller .
however , food was comped because we complained .
literally the worst place i have ever eaten in my entire life .
i did n't know that a restaurant could serve dog meat in america .
i would not wish this hole on an enemy .
at least the kids linguine soaked in vegetable oil will shoot through them quickly .
on the bright side our waitress only visited our table three times .
next , he ignored us and sat down watching the game .
wow , ate there the other day with my family and was very disappointed .
tough & way too fatty .
really disappointed in this place .
complete joke and very unprofessional .
this place goes to show you that crooks wo n't stay in business long .
i 'm glad i trusted my gut on this one .
we tried to , the pro was a jerk and service was terrible .
the course was in decent shape for the price paid .
however , the service is lacking every time i come here .
me know what was wrong .
and i could wait in there lobby .
after driving for _num_ miles , the problem still remained with absolutely no improvement .
nick also gave us all of the old parts that he had replaced .
do n't take your car here .
rip off !
stop raising our rates you douche bags .
again ridiculous !
they charge an initial $ _num_ deposit .
seriously , they are not business friendly .
why can you not pay their overpriced bills with a credit card .
why do we not have another choice for our electric ?
another $ _num_ deposit !
my pool pump does n't go on until 9:00 pm .
i do n't cook inside in the summer .
only after 8:00 pm , even on the weekends .
this is beyond ridiculous !
scam .
we tried it for _num_ month and switched back to basic .
but i guess they do n't base it off of your credit .
ridiculous !
_num_ to _num_ .
unfortunately , they have repeatedly let me down .
needless to say , this ruined my appetite .
_num_ years ago i joined az cu as a student and got screwed over .
i once got $ _num_ out of the atm to pay for food .
i complained and got nowhere with their unfriendly customer service .
i was disappointed on all _num_ counts .
_num_ and _num_ .
throughout my mortgage application process , i was promised a _num_ % interest rate .
the site kept showing _num_ % for days or weeks afterwards .
the customer service is terrible and their atm never works right .
i would give them a _num_ star if i could .
worst company i have worked with since i have had my business .
she demanded the $ _num_ to cancel the contract .
that is a $ _num_ product .
do not trust them with access to your account .
as a small business they have almost ruined me .
if i could give this company _num_ stars , i would .
do not trust them with your financial information .
i 'm a small business and they totally ruined me .
the tacos i got literally looked like the ones at jack in the box .
it was a week day during the lunch hours .
poor food and even worse service .
this is not real mexican food .
the beans were good but the concept was not understood .
everything else was bland .
a little over priced too .
i doubt i 'll be back .
nothing is authentic here , too much cheese , beans and not much flavor .
i was even more confused .
needless to say , i will not be back .
gross .
another five to six minutes go by .
it 'll be awhile before i come back to this location again .
he said the veggies were so greasy he could n't eat them .
greasy , greasy .
a tv dinner would have tasted fresher .
now , sadly we cross off yet another mexican restaurant here in tempe .
no one near us knows how to cook fajitas .
unfortunately it is about an hour drive from our house .
wish i had better news for you people craving some good mexican food .
that is no excuse .
at this rate , another valley landmark might soon be going away .
we ate there and the food went downhill too .
mediocre food ... i can cook that at home !
i 've eaten here at least _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
i was not impressed with this place .
water and tea has a musty taste .
salsa was too chunky .
i was a customer for over _num_ years until december 9th .
i order the same thing every time .
the mini appetizer substitute fundido instead of guacamole .
apparently at this location that is n't allowed .
a side of fundido is $ _num_ they say .
does n't make sense .
here , blah .
do n't waste your time .
this is not really a mexican restaurant .
even the guacamole did not taste right .
my chips were never refilled i had to ask .
i wo n't be back .
salsa does n't have a bite so to me it 's lacking .
beverage delivery to our table was super slow .
two entree with one side combo was n't quite prepared right .
mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them .
service was n't what i would have expected .
my son is particular about his food as he is _num_ .
we have done this before and there was never a problem there .
my mom and i left feeling very disappointed .
no way .
so my mom and i left and ate somewhere else .
could he bend a rule for a _num_ year old ?
i felt very disappointed in the customer service of the manager .
i was very disappointed .
i understand that the staff is short , they are looking to hire .
water , chips , salsa , etc .
but , our service was not good at all .
we made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though .
the worst human i 've encountered in at least _num_ years .
offensive , tacky , and unprofessional .
terrible service .
bad food .
empty drink forever .
wo n't be back to this one .
my daughter did n't get her food even started until we got ours .
awful experience .
when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food .
the food is great but it 's a shame the management is so terrible .
immediately we asked to see a manager and tammy ignored our request .
what tammy did tonight at our table was highly illegal .
legal action will be taken if not addressed or ignored .
not a good experience with management .
manager made me feel like she was doing me a one time favor .
could have been avoided all together if the serving staff knew the menu better .
bad drivers , too fast and out of control .
messy store , dirty , sticky counters .
overhead music playing and a radio playing different music loud .
lets start with the poor customer service .
even when they have the staff to take care of it .
the floor in the fountain area is always dirty too .
have to agree ; probably the worst place for `` seafood '' around .
talk about annoying - the wait staff , especially .
no , it 's not the service .
i guess eating mediocre food in peace is n't good enough .
that 's your warning .
absurd .
the food is n't that much better , either .
instead of a headache , you get to walk away with an upset stomach .
so , why _num_ stars ?
the waitress recommended sam adam 's oktoberfest instead .
what i would n't give right now for another pint of oktoberfest .
the crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese .
i asked for mine without , but regretted it immediately .
no taste .
save your time and money and avoid this place !
if you 're looking for seafood , go to the salt cellar .
at least there , you 'll get what you pay for .
( not to mention the blue dye they have in their fake pond outside .
what the hell is that about ? )
i will never go to this horrid place again .
horrible !
i was sick for two days after eating here .
the decor is the only thing this place had in common with it .
did n't like the taste of the broccoli .
i 'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews .
the hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing .
they seated tables that were obviously still dirty which was gross .
i wish the experience was better than it was .
unfortunately i probably wo n't go back here .
looking around , there did n't seem to be a server in our area .
waiting waiting waiting again .
in all , not a positive experience .
my girlfriend 's salad was more dressing than anything else .
the food was so-so , but the service was dismal .
i will never return to this restaurant .
i decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes , big mistake .
they exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done .
things seem to have really gone downhill since then .
the food and the service at this `` restaurant '' are equally terrible .
this did n't even include ordering food , much less getting it .
the food is very bland .
i 've tried this place a few times , that was my last time .
the food is not good to me .
i 've been there at least _num_ times .
food is very bland .
and just not very good .
the place was okay , i went there saturday night .
so my boyfriend and i gave it a try .
i ate the shrimp alfredo and my boyfriend had a burger .
and the food is better and a lot less expensive .
i 've been to other joe 's crab shack 's that were much better .
this one had extremely slow service .
not only that , but i had to keep asking the waiter for refills .
no bueno .
tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall .
we were both very disappointed .
the food was absolutely terrible .
neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left .
this place in general is a little too cheesy for me .
they offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff .
it is almost like you are buying a used car .
the food itself is just ok .
nothing to write home about .
cody forgot my chowder and didnt apologize .
walked in for lunch , the place was empty .
sat down waited five minutes with no welcome or drink order , walked out .
i was pretty disappointed on this visit .
once we arrived , we still had to wait for a half hour .
they had way too much pepper for one thing and no breading at all .
all my elderly parents ordered was a bowl of soup each .
the soup came out the first time cold -- ok , that is understandable .
`` ) , once again , the soup was cold .
no visit from the manager ?
the place was very loud .
over all , over priced and loud .
should receive zero stars .
we were seated by a table of about _num_ , _num_ were children .
the worst experience i have ever had after spending a $ _num_ .
my wife ordered the queen crab pot with a garlic butter sauce .
service overall was very slow .
the meals , save for the crab legs , were generally over salted .
the stuffed shrimp were ... .
that 's the only way to describe it .
the tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise .
the reason for my _num_ stars is because of the service .
i 'll get my seafood fix somewhere else .
food was poorly cooked and greasy and way overpriced .
we will never go to joes crab shack again .
slow service mediocre to lousy food .
will not be back .
one star just for the hospitality , _num_ $ for four pounds !
lack of flavor !
i absolutely love joes but not this location and here 's why .
( bed hair and all ) and they had no energy at all !
the place was so noisy we could n't hear each other talk .
the skillet paella dish has been removed .
_num_ % + was breading .
the calamari was too large and rubbery .
not small and tender .
should have gone to pollo loco in the arizona mills shopping center .
the problem was with the menu .
crab cake was extremely salty .
not a good experience with the exception of our server matt .
they kept picking up the phone and just hanging up .
no apology whatsoever .
guess you 're too busy for these customers because we will never be returning .
my husband and i both became ill after eating here .
very disappointed , next time i 'll go to red lobster !
this was a horrible experience from beginning to end .
disgusting .
but , it gets worse from there .
recall , if you will , the place was almost empty .
the crab cake was cold in the middle .
the fried fish and onion rings tasted like old grease .
there was almost no fish inside the greasy batter .
the only thing that was good was the french fries .
i hardly ate anything on the plate .
then the waiter came out to bring out drinks and his hand was bleeding .
it was just an overall bad experience .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
crab was overcooked too .
and finally , our bill was wrong .
poor experience .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
crab was overcooked too .
and finally , our bill was wrong .
poor experience .
however when the check arrived , the appetizer was charged .
this was no mistake .
then the _num_ min wait happened to get drinks delivered to the table .
side orders were forgotten because waiter was not using note pad .
i am extremely disappointed with the service i received from this place .
mistake # _num_ and still no manager .
food was good but service was horrible .
very poor service , unfriendly , inattentive , food was just barely fair .
once before we were there an never got waited on .
however , it 's been more than _num_ years since my last visit .
my husband had never even heard of them , let alone dined there .
for me , when i walked in , it was just like old times .
the bright side is he brought out our drinks correctly .
and this is where the problems came about .
however , the manager 's responses were great .
for my husband , not so much .
my husband would have given it one star because of the entire experience .
we came late , on a saturday night , and were quickly seated .
in total , we were probably helped by _num_ different servers .
it 's way too loud .
i could n't hold a conversation with my date .
it was very annoying .
the food is not fresh .
with tip and no booze , for _num_ people was $ _num_ .
the meal was $ _num_ tops .
i ate half of it before i noticed .
this is n't a great place .
should have tipped me off .
_num_ tv 's were showing different sports channels above the bar .
the food was nothing above ok .
do n't you want your special to be the things you do well ?
just make sure you 've eaten dinner before you go .
ps - and do n't use the bathroom unless you really really have to .
so far the worst italian i 've had in the valley .
`` no , '' she said .
`` i ca n't talk right now .
big mistake .
more like ... cardboard .
mmmm ... cardboard parmesan .
seriously , it was gross .
it came with a side of spaghetti , which was all right .
not as gross as the eggplant , but still not good .
bad service , bad food .
the eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried .
the drinks were weak .
very weak .
the meal was one of the worst i have had in ages .
hands down , i will not be returning .
i would hate to see the place with the lights on !
even the service was only fair .
do n't waste your time or money !
do n't eat here .
they tasted like watered down coke .
maybe it was the _num_ yr old bartender .
the pizza was just ok , far from amazing .
i adore cats , but not in restaurants .
unfortunately there is n't a lower rating for this joke of a bar .
i will not be going back and urge you to support another local establishment .
this restaurant deserves no stars .
the second was there was not a server in sight .
after about _num_ minutes , a sever did appear from the back somewhere .
bad sign # _num_ .
bad sign # _num_ .
cheese and sauce were some odd orange color with a awful taste .
i threw this pizza out the next day .
she said no , and that no one else had complained .
the owner came over and questioned me .
i mean , they were n't going to give me fresh beer ?
sorry guys , definitely lost this customer .
i wo n't be back .
the house salad is really poor .
when i went there the other day the service was really terrible .
i was wrong .
my wife got the wrong dressing but ate it anyway .
we continued to dessert despite my better judgement .
forty dollars and tip for a meal this bad is ridiculous !
all i can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp .
and a boston bar , no less .
it 's a little expensive for a dive bar too .
there 's too many other bars within a block to waste time there .
the food is only okay and you can only get beer and wine here .
i struggled to find any flavor at all in the pizza .
crust was very tasteless .
got a caprese , tomatoes were hard and pink .
that is just flat out nuts .
pizza was great but the worst customer service ever .
it was 9:30 by the time my pizza came .
the weak instant iced tea was priced at $ _num_ .
if these prices seem just a little high , its because they are !
however , the quality of the food was just ... ... ok .
the thin sliced sausage was alright , but not spectacular .
this place is overpriced and not very good .
crust is tough , toppings are minimal .
never again folks .
we were very disappointed with this place .
my pizza , a sausage pie , came out burned .
i tasted charcoal more than i did sausage .
she should have noticed the burnt pie , however .
it 's not .
in a bad way .
the vegetarian pizza , however , did n't look too appetizing .
the taste is where it all fell apart .
the wood burning oven taste was not there .
there was n't the smoky flavor you 'd expect .
or drove ten more miles and went to bianco .
bad ?
no way .
no how .
embarrassed to walk out i gave it a try to see if any good .
ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest .
what i got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it .
at any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry .
also there was no wood oven taste .
not worth it and was not very good .
the worst pizza ever .
pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like wonder bread , all doughy & sweet .
this place is an insult to italian pizza .
just sad .
there were _num_ strips of sausage , _num_ pepperoni slices and _num_ mushroom slices .
not a good start , to say the least .
after hearing the rave reviews from neighbors , i finally tried their pizza .
i thought it was ok , but nothing super special .
nope sorry !
the crust was pathetic .
the cheese on the pizza was not bad .
i feel he did not cook it long enough for my taste .
i wo n't be going back .
plus their beer selection sucks .
i guess polish beer for the polish owner .
seriously though , polish beer in an italian pizza joint ?
then we split a spinach pizza .
another joke , limp pizza , tasteless and dry tasteless crust .
just not worth it , do n't waste your money there !
so far , i 'm not impressed .
now , i have no ac and they are n't offering much to help !
so far , it has been quite the opposite .
by far the worst apartment complex i have ever lived in .
also , the apartment smelt like pure smoke !
the walls were dripping yellow the smoke was so bad !
the management company constantly tried to add hundreds of dollars onto my bill .
i would have put negative stars if i could .
never ever ever decide to live here you will regret it .
worst experience as a tenant .
even the smallest of things !
the leaking continued so i had a second plumber come out at no charge .
note : no weekend or emergency service .
my refrigerator was n't working .
he did not give me a receipt .
when i realized that , i tried to catch him before he drove away .
unfortunately i found quite the opposite !
i could n't believe all the other yelp reviews are positive !
expensive service company - based on yelp review though to give a try .
for me their service charge , repair cost and cost to install was expensive .
home depot install microwave for _num_ $ .
which seems like quite a hefty price tag for literally not doing anything .
so far , i 'm not impressed .
now , i have no ac and they are n't offering much to help !
so far , it has been quite the opposite .
no heat ( in december when it was _num_ degrees out ) .
toilet plumbing issues .
kitchen sink clogged for two days .
no bathroom fan for two weeks .
no access to my own laundry room when the building was getting painted .
right now , my shower water does n't heat up .
i guess you get the price you pay for .
nice facility .
but most of the staff is very rude .
two years later i want to reserve another spot for my daughter 's birthday .
they advised me that this is not their procedure .
it took me a dozen tries just to get into my room .
the breakfast is mediocre at best .
but as a place simply to spend the night , it 'll suffice .
decor very dated .
pool area disgusting ( dirty ) .
upon entering our room , i was immediately disappointed .
the place was dingy and dirty .
i was afraid to touch anything and i could n't wait to leave .
after a angry conversation i end up in handicapped room .
not the worst hotel .
it does n't smell like smoke it smells like mold or mildew .
i 'm to stay another night but that 's not going to happen .
anyways , the rooms are cheap for a reason .
the room is disgusting .
carpet was stained and looks like it has n't had a cleaning for years .
bath tub was beyond disgusting .
stayed at embassy suites on our way back and it was sooooo much better .
ok price , good breakfast but trash everywhere and bathroom reeked of urine .
i would not stay again .
my _num_ day stay was _num_ days too long .
, rude !
no directions no suggestions .
this place is disgusting !
the bun was dry and stale .
i do n't think i have ever had one i did n't like before .
the topping bar is so simple and plain .
the dips are not very good ... cheese dip is yuck !
cookies taste raw and boring .
i thought they were a total waste of calories .
_num_ years ago i would have given this place _num_ stars .
also they prices then were in par with other locations across the country .
i can get a 1/2 lbs bacon cheese burger combo for $ _num_ .
i am convinced that they use the fake beef that taco bell does .
their burgers taste like salt and butter flavored pam to me .
the caesar salad was drenched in dressing ... practically a soup of dressing .
went there last week and was completely disappointed .
there was no malt vinegar for the fries .
most of the toppings on the salad bar were missing or really messed up .
they used to provide whole pickles but not any more .
very disappointing meal !
i was n't impressed with this restaurant .
my burger was not that tasty and undercooked .
never been to this location and wo n't be back .
this place is horrible !
this place has surely changed for the worst .
the bad parts are that the entire restaurant was dirty !
the place was less than half full of customers .
most boring strip club in phoenix metro .
why _num_ ?
i lost _num_ bucks in _num_ minutes .
i am a local and i am never going back there again .
worst strip club ever !
too bad for them .
terrible service !
no one greeted me nor said a word .
no where to be found .
when we started eating the pizza , that was cold as well.
it tasted like it was sitting out forever !
refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation .
you lost four customers today .
the pizza that was delivered were prepared horribly !
one pizza was overly cooked and had almost no cheese at all .
perhaps it is their business model , but the staff are rotating on deliveries .
they only seem to care about making their tips .
i was distracted and paid it without paying attention .
after last night i will never order from any domino 's again .
yet you offer no solutions .
horrible service .
this is an utter insult !
manager extremely rude .
never in my life have i encountered a manager like that .
which was $ _num_ bill .
what a bummer , i was really looking forward to my pizza .
but they usually take that off the price for customer satisfaction .
the store itself is dirty on the outside , as well as the inside .
the produce section had flies all over the fruits and vegetables .
i do not recommend coming to this store unless it is your only option .
i 'm not a big fan if this grocery store .
quite rude i think !
does n't seem like the cleanest of places and my nails are lifting already .
rather upsetting because they are soooo cute .
went another time because i had always had luck in the past .
the actual polish job was good , but the massage was awful .
jenny is very rude !
unbelievable i will never return to this place .
yea ... never going back here again .
the woman looked at me and gave me an uncomfortable smile .
you cant paint nails and not put bottom coat .
i obviously told him absolutely not !
she looked so irritated .
i was not pleased .
also they did n't clean up my cuticles very well .
its not worth it .
the place could use an overhaul .
when i 'm tanning , sorry .
i went here to get a spray tan done for an event .
cathy , the area manager , sprayed me .
she spent the entire time telling me how great she was at spray tanning .
refund my money .
cathy finally said she would give me $ _num_ back .
however we moved to chandler and i had to cancel my membership .
they refunded my money , but still have my lotion .
i left this apartment spotless .
needless to say i was sure a mistake had been made .
very bad bee problem .
poor customer service at front office .
office manager rude !
`` poor '' tenants , glass in the landscaping and rocks .
potential tenant , ask yourself this , do you want your deposit back ?
cars that are n't sitting broken down ?
rent that is reasonable for the area ?
the quality of the carpet is low , what do you expect ?
nothing excessive , of course .
remember , _num_ years of leasing .
its all _num_ % true .
`` we are sorry to hear .
other then that there is no plus to living here .
worst place you could ever live at .
it started off great , but now it 's going downhill .
super cheap , thin carpet .
the south side , not so much .
the electrical outlet was being used by maintenance .
does n't this count as entering my property without notice ?
i was lied to when i moved in and it never stopped .
this is a huge , expensive and sad lesson i learned by living here .
do n't drop your rent at the office .
do n't send it certified , that 's not proof of payment .
i 'm not .
sadly this is legal in arizona and they take advantage of it .
when a tree fell on my car , management did nothing to help !
a week later , we received another notice stating we still did n't pay .
when we found the correct location it was quite chaotic and disorganized .
we wo n't be back though .
i called the gym , they did not cancel my membership .
finally got to a live person that had no idea .
transferred to another who also had no idea what open swim is .
trust me -- save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere .
i stated i did not want to provide it unless it was necessary .
it 's terrible .
they were not even shipped out yet .
we straight up said ok give us the refund and we will go elsewhere .
so i have to wait another _num_ days to get them fixed .
they seem like a high turn over in doctors .
prices are too high .
took _num_ 1/2 months to get my glasses and they still were not right .
the service is awful !
this branch is terrible !
overall not a place that i would tell people to go to .
in short : a shell of its former glory , but still edible .
i hear there was an ownership change and all went down hill from there .
the sauces were extremely bland .
several items on the buffet were just plain stale .
what a disappointment .
no brown rice .
it did not even taste like lamb anymore .
the plain naan which i love elsewhere , was tasteless .
some chick pea dish was ok but there was n't much of it .
the place looked pretty sad , not so clean .
no wonder !
we will not be back .
some days are good , some days are bad .
in another experience , my dad got sick the next day .
not my favorite at all , it was just ok .
i would like to try the buffet though .
the check was a little over $ _num_ .
so why are they holding my money for _num_ week .
this makes no sense .
the bank is terrible .
i wish i could get my wife to change banks .
i just want to make a deposit .
third , no drive through banking .
my money was stolen on multiple occasions right out of my account .
they replaced it but geez then it would happen again .
no i didnt .
ca n't stand bank of america .
really guys , what bank does n't want to take your money ?
this place is not inviting .
you have to wait in long lines .
as a matter of fact , there was probably one stain if any .
they will steel your money , take it from me .
first _num_ hours .
someone else mentioned the birds .
it 's not only ducks .
excuse me , but that is not my error nor am i at fault .
again , miss property manager just said `` it is not my problem . ''
but i have been left with no choice at this point !
about _num_ months in to our lease , our washer broke .
it took _num_ weeks to get a new one .
even when they came they did n't fix it and left mess .
finally , this past week our a/c went out .
i lived here _num_ years ago and i didnt stay long .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
they refused to fix this for _num_ months .
- water damage in the outside storage closet ruined my belongings .
they did n't care .
literally the worst place i have ever lived in .
rude rude rude !
do n't waste your time and money - you will regret moving here .
all of the negative reviews are _num_ % accurate .
after _num_ attempts to reach management , i finally went to bed .
_num_ days without air conditioning and counting .
just as nick wrote , jordan is awful .
she makes everything super difficult and talks to you like you are a child .
from the beginning it was a nightmare .
it is not even worth calling them for .
i have had the absolute worst experience with this place .
worst apartment manager i 've ever dealt with .
they run all their loud equipment before sunrise .
then , last year , the water pump failed on the stream outside .
you tell mike , he makes excuses .
jordan ca n't be bothered but to consider her tenants as the enemy .
then , there are the tenants .
if you do not , they will pretend they did n't say it .
lastly , this place is seriously overpriced for what you get .
this place is awful in every way imaginable .
this is by far the worst apartment complex that i have ever lived in .
the staff is rude and extremely unhelpful .
it 's been _num_ minutes now .
gourmet wok used to be my favorite chinese restaurant .
this one have terrible crappy food with the worst customer services .
their customer service is horrible .
they gave me something else which cost me much more them that .
and they even denied that it was their fault !
and the way they talked to me was extremely rude !
i figured with egg roll and lo mein , the combination would probably work .
after picking up the food town items , i walked toward gourmet wok .
my thai basil chicken combination cost $ _num_ based on the paper menu .
with tax , i paid $ _num_ .
i asked for some pepper oil , and was provided with a container .
cabbage , carrots , but no seasoning ... frozen , not prepared fresh .
last but not least , the thai basil chicken with no basil .
the chicken ... no .
the pieces were very uniform , very soft ( beyond tender ) and flavorless .
first time , not very impressed .
bad service is sooo not cool .
i have ate here before , the food was ok .
you have been warned .
other than them , the bar was completely empty .
he was a complete jerk and seemed like he was on something .
there were no other staff that i saw .
but this is very much not a social scene hangout .
avoid this like the plague .
this was a terrible experience .
the bartender had no idea what we were asking for .
needless to say , we did not stay long .
do not come here if you are looking for a good time .
shame for what used to be a nice neighborhood spot .
when i get something that tastes off in a restaurant .
one word is gross .
i will never be back to this dank and filthy place .
food was not bad not nothing special either .
i was only asked for a drink once with no refills on the water .
she gave us a dirty menu and never came back to take our order .
i would not go back .
it was horrible service !
the wings were tasty , but had no sauce .
the beers were cheap , but it was like pulling teeth to order one .
i ca n't think of a good reason to stop in again .
the biggest problem is the overall appearance of the bar .
if the ambience were to be improved , this place would probably be packed .
the food took twice as long , again ... it was n't busy yet .
just imagine how long it took once they filled up the place .
the food is your average bar food , decently edible .
i would probably not go here again .
there are many better sports bars within a few miles of this place .
baseline sports bar is now a newly renovated bar called brick and barley .
never acknowledged us coming in or while we were sitting at the table waiting .
very disappointed !
went there before bar rescue and it was dirty and not very inviting .
would not recommend this to anyone !
so sad .
i have been coming here off and on for many years .
i wo n't be back .
not much .
my boyfriend is a fan of the draft choices .
disgusting flat stella on draft and service was horrible .
what a waste of space .
i came back today to pick it up and the tags were completely gone .
anyway , i wo n't be going back .
i gave apple one _num_ star because they did n't help me at all .
i went to the apple one location at _num_ s. gilbert rd .
i 've worked in plenty of offices and i know that one .
all i have to say is what a complete idiot !
so unprofessional , unorganized , and lacking common sense .
if i could give them no stars , i would have !
i joined them in october _num_ and it is now january _num_ .
extremely rude with a bad attitude .
and quickly hung up .
but whats the point if they never get back to you .
i was placed in position by them that i complained several times about .
nine months later , they still refuse to help me with other opportunities .
they do not care about their staff .
met with sherry who displayed very little professionalism !
the degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here .
wish i knew that before wasting my time with them !
terrible customer service .
checking in and checking out was smooth and the employees were very friendly .
all of their `` queen size '' beds are _num_ inches .
this is the qt that 's walking distance from my house .
my old qt was the one on scottsdale rd just north of the _num_ .
that 's useless to me .
wish they would smoke around back though .
i 've probably been to this location _num_ times .
twice so far , they 've gotten my order completely wrong .
so no more stopping by this mcdonald 's .
i 'll go to sonic down the street for my desserts .
they lost my order and said they are not responsible for lost items .
no credit .
no sorry !
no nothing !
but when i went to pick up my pants , they 'd lost them .
they wo n't pay replacement value , because the pants were n't new ?
nightmare customer service , all driven by a nasty owner .
i 'm with paul c -- better goodwill , than dry cleaners .
this is probably the worst dry cleaner i have ever been to .
this is absolutely ridiculous !
when i got my clothes back i only got my jacket back .
never again will i support a company that is dishonest and disrespectful .
its a crappy french pedicure .
its too big & the lines were very uneven .
that did n't work out so well .
now they just look terrible .
so today , she is going back in , to get her money back .
i 've been to this place twice before for a gel manicure .
also , the overall quality of his service just sucked .
i went in on a saturday for a gel manicure with an appointment .
the worst place i have ever been too .
i have never been treated so poorly ever .
the man who did my nails ruined them .
and he was so rude the rest of the time .
do not go to cactus nails .
very disappointed with cactus nails !
the water was cold by the time someone helped me .
not satisfied .
coming here was the worst mistake ever !
i was extremely livid .
my _num_ year old could 've done a better job .
now it hurts to use them .
coming here was the worst mistake ever !
i was extremely livid .
my _num_ year old could 've done a better job .
i went back two days later and got my money back .
the owner was the one that did them in case y'all were wondering .
do n't like fast food , but sometimes you just have to settle .
negative : nothing ever tastes right .
the chili is served the wrong side of warm .
worn paint and damaged seating everywhere .
the food is low quality , even by wendy 's low standards .
i remember thinking the hamburger tasted just like my mom 's .
frankly , i would not try wendy 's again .
there was too much sauce .
the burger burn was stiff .
the guy at the counter said he gave my friend 's food away .
be a little more careful next time ?
i was n't looking for a big order .
this place is garbage !
maybe we got a bad apartment but still it was a headache .
the spa was broken for _num_ months when we first moved here .
our ac has been broken a few times this summer .
if i could give zero stars i would .
huge shout out to them for being the only reliable people .
update : the ownership changed and now this salon is much less appealing .
the last manicure i had was not good quality .
i wish i knew where wendy and danny went !
i ca n't say enough how great this salon is .
came here for a brow wax and the woman messed them up terribly .
pedicure was good but the polish job was awful !
come to find out they used the wrong acrylic .
pretty stupid mistake to make from a professional nail salon .
went in for a gel manicure .
nothing too crazy .
polish job was insanely horrible .
cuticles barely cut .
very rude staff .
do not go unless you want to waste your time for a terrible service .
how is it possible to mess up chinese food you may ask ?
just come here during dinner time and you too can find out .
any hole in the wall chinese restaurant is better then this !
when i told her she gave me attitude .
okay i guess .
just wished they had gluten-free options .
steer clear of this place unless you 're in the mood to be angry .
could be so much better !
what i got was _num_ orange chicken and asked for _num_ teriyaki sauce !
terrible service especially from amanda .
_num_ hours goes by , no call .
near the end of the _num_ hour stretch , i called and got chris .
who told me she would leave a message for chris to call me back .
so he gets me my laptop and i go on my way .
i stayed here without a car and felt uncomfortable walking to restaurants .
not safe .
when i made the reservation , i was told that breakfast was included .
there was no kitchen at this place or restaurant .
i told the manager and she did n't really care to explain .
i find that the new house where i was moving was not complete .
this tops the charts on reason i have been asked to leave .
yoga is about finding your inner peace , not taking orders .
sorry , but i like my two minutes of peace & quiet .
the only great thing about this studio is the friendly attitude of the staff .
i 'm not sure i want to give this studio my money again .
after reading all of the reviews i was very excited to try this place .
however , the front desk associate was not .
this woman was extremely rude to me .
she handed me the form to fill out .
i put the pen down and leave .
i could n't even get the cleaning today ?
a ) i 'm over doctor offices that do n't respect my time .
b ) i really did n't get the staffing arrangement .
you do n't have to be the doctor to do that .
this place is horrible !
if you have a choice , do n't go here .
the last one was less than _num_ hour before my appointment .
mind you , i was advised at this date of service i owed nothing .
cleaning was less that _num_ min total .
they still use film x-rays -no digital .
_num_ minutes .
gave them an awesome review .
and i looked at the mirror on my teeth .
totally unsatisfied .
and no , i will not be returning !
i would not recommend this nail salon to no one .
she also told me if i do n't like it do n't come back .
do not go to this nail salon .
einstein bros bagels in tempe is my typical go-to breakfast spot .
what 's not to like !
if you are a fan of this chain , avoid this location .
everytime i come here they forget something in my order .
they all seem to be rude and hate there job .
slow service , unless you 're a regular .
nothing difficult , three bagels toasted with cream cheese to go .
seems regular customers get more priority .
today order was done wrong .
it was a little weird .
i would visit again , but probably not at this location .
soooo disappointed because of what i was expecting .
this is the worst einstein ever .
never have coffee brewed and the employees ignore you when you come in .
they were adding the cream cheese on top of that .
i only found out after going to another location .
my bagel today was horrible .
it was dry , cold , and over toasted .
i 'm not sure what the green stuff was .
it was disgusting .
sat down and ate my meal that i paid for prepared wrong .
this location is no different .
i walked in and the cashier was looking down .
never did acknowledge me until i said excuse me .
on the whole an irritating experience .
i mean really , though , two tomatoes and no lox ?
she was kind of rude from start to finish .
not impressed .
sales people were nice , however pricey considering each separate was over $ _num_ .
how the mighty have fallen .
it lacks the charm i remember the old metro center location having .
listen to a loud conversation about a guy 's terrible luck .
this place needs a major overhaul .
this place is just nasty all around .
chips and salsa are off to the side and free for the taking .
when i received my burger it was : _num_ .
not the right burger i ordered , _num_ .
not very good since the meat was very dry and bland .
do n't have the little brown lady cut your hair .
they placed the muffler on anyway and it literally fell off while driving !
if i could give zero stars , i would .
second time not the charm .
asked for refund , refused .
was unacceptable and asked for them to be cleaned .
i would recommend finding somewhere else if you 're looking for quality work .
i was n't not happy about this .
very poor craftsmanship , very poor customer service .
they ruined an expensive pair of shoes !
i will never visit this place again .
customers needed help and they were n't approached .
she is sitting with me now writing this review and i love her .
very disappointing and he actually was not apologetic in the least .
that is poor .
they still have not responded to any of my emails .
so the woman put me on hold and suddenly a man ( owner ? )
delivery fee , plus another fee ?
anyway , i could tell he was in a big rush too .
i was disappointed in the pulled pork sandwich .
there was very little flavor and not enough sauce on it .
sides are weak .
very weak .
rib tips have no meat .
hot links , nasty .
nasty ... .
she told me that their italian beef was popular .
that leads me to believe it was already made before i got it .
i think i also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well .
overall , the worst bbq place i 've been too .
i 'm not surprised because chicago people ca n't do anything right .
they screwed up pizza and the hot dog .
rant over .
so i had the beef tips and chicken .
both heavily smoked and drowned in the same sauce .
beef and chicken ... two completely different animals , but both tasted identical .
the spicy sauce was bland and did n't have the slightest kick to it .
the beef tips were overcooked , tough and chewy .
the bone in the chicken was broken in two places and grossed me out .
everything else ended up in the trash .
i am sad to report i am not going back there to eat .
they just do not seem to care about the customer anymore .
i decided to give the place a second try after my last horrible experience .
i have been a customer for _num_ years , but now no more .
she really did n't look like someone who should be behind the counter .
the food was fast , but really no flavor .
the hot sauce was spicy , and the onion straws were over seasoned .
am looking for new bbq in phoenix .
and the guy at the counter was beyond rude to me when i ordered .
sad thing is is that i work in the same business complex as them .
i will no longer be going there for lunch .
their food is terrible !
as bad as the food is , their service is worse !
lousy customer service !
bad attitude !
made the experience even worse .
i will definitely not be a repeat customer .
lunch special lacked ingredients shown in photo .
pickles were left out , though they were in the photo .
the french fries were the most god awful i 've ever had .
a dirty grease color , limp , soggy , and not even edible .
but this tom 's has a problem .
what could be so bad ?
what was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket .
not $ _num_ .
not $ _num_ .
i walked in to find a small restaurant .
this italian beef was bland , they had the soggy part right .
the hot dog was even worse .
this was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog .
then cucumber slices and practically no onion .
overall tom 's bbq was a big disappointment .
i 've had bbq in chicago and this place does n't come close .
the five underneath it were thin and dry .
the chicken and brisket were also dry as dust !
very poor food , unfortunately .
i 'm originally from illinois so of course i decided to try this establishment .
i had better luck down the street at subway .
do n't waste your time .
the taste , the vibe , the kindness just was n't there for us .
heck , the q was dry !
no amount of sauces can cover that up .
i doubt i 'll be going back .
the brisket here at tom 's was just ok .
these were very very dry and rubbery .
the pork was not mixed with the bbq like pulled pork normally is .
the corn was also disgusting .
the bbq beans were the only good factor of our meal .
have not eaten these yet .
but how can you mess up a hot dog ?
when i looked at this sandwich it was drowned in bbq sauce .
the pull pork did n't have any taste what so ever .
all i tasted was bbq sauce .
_num_ dollars for sandwich with no taste nor flavor it not worth my time .
wo n't go back .
horrible excuse for bbq .
ribs are flavorless , tough , and chewy .
sauce and sides are just as nasty .
$ _num_ for meat that should be fed to dogs .
i want to give it zero stars .
however , what really counts is the food ; which was awful .
i ordered the _num_ meat combo with chicken and ribs .
i can almost guarantee this meat has never seen the inside of a smoker .
furthermore , the sauce tastes like they picked it up at costco .
this place did not have that .
it was like we got the damn left overs .
overall , not going back .
no flavor , unless you count the kinda salty ketchup they call bbq sauce .
the only thing i can say is go to mcdonalds or any place else .
the food was terrible .
the french fries were so bad they went in the trash .
all you could taste was grease and bbq sauce .
one of the worst dinners i 've had in a long time .
i think the problem with tom 's bbq is they have loss their touch .
i am pulling for this place , i want to see it happen .
oh also the ladies room had a bad sewer smell .
the whole entire experience for me yesterday was a train wreck .
the staff seemed to not know what the hell they were doing .
but my stylist apparently did n't feel like using a dryer with me .
nothing , just awful customer care .
then i honestly was tired of being there .
no no no .
every other time i visited this location , the staff provided great service .
i do n't remember my stylist 's name because she was n't very friendly .
she cut my hair and then talked about how my hair is super thin .
any idea to make me look like i have more hair i 'm thrilled .
big mistake .
i think it 's ugly and am just dying for it to grow back .
but never with me again .
kind of ridiculous .
the problem with this place is their drive-thru .
this is not one of those places .
not cool .
customer service very poor !
i have been in the drive-through , two cars back for almost _num_ minutes .
kind of weird as the store seems empty .
this store is ghetto in comparison to other walgreens stores i have been in .
the store is not the cleanest in my honest opinion .
i wo n't go to this location unless i absolutely have to .
the inside is old and the employees clearly are n't happy to be there .
we ordered food .
it came totally wrong .
i can not believe they let that thing out the door .
i just hated it .
that is not really a bread bowl .
me and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad , sans cheese .
when i finally saw the apartment , i felt like i had been had .
the paint was sloppy .
i 'm amazed none of them broke while i was cleaning .
lastly , their pet policy is pretty bad .
but all of this should have been done before moving anyone in !
i 'm angry , upset , and disgusted .
this place will mask anything to get your money .
there was no remodel , there was only a cover up .
spend your money elsewhere because it certainly is n't worth it here .
i felt and still feel so disrespected !
i signed a _num_ month less and i am miserable in this apartment !
my kids and i hate it here now .
either way i 'm screwed !
it 's extremely surprising there are no reviews on yelp for this place !
i basically left there feeling things crawl all over me .
i doubt the management company knows what 's going on .
the office does nothing .
everything i stated above is still accurate which is sad .
apparently no one had told him that we had moved in yet .
my husbands car was also broken into twice while living here .
do not move to this location .
my husband & i already regret moving here after _num_ month .
low grade features are not luxury .
nothing gets done when dogs bark at all hours .
the grounds are poorly kept and there are birds and bird poop everywhere .
you should expect to see cockroaches any and every where outside your apartment .
horrible !
after living here a year , i would not recommend anyone to move here .
management is rude and unprofessional .
it is not worth it and there are much better places than here .
but unfortunately that 's about it .
there is a huge bug problem .
it was disgusting .
sick people .
rude to others .
trust me spend the extra money you wont have to deal with .
let 's begin this list .
i have been here for _num_ months , and hate it .
the management is lazy , rude and do n't really care about their tenants .
why the heck is that ok ?
yet they change the dates _num_ times and do n't give updates .
they `` renovated '' the gym but it is horrible .
took away the mirrors and replaced the doors that 's it .
creepy neighbors that seem to be on drugs non stop .
gross .
the apartments have cheap carpet in them .
would not recommend .
gilbert came back to our table and asked how _num_ a mo .
they can waste your time just as good as anyone else .
i would not purchase a vehicle from them or ever use there service .
i have purchased two cars from chapman , each with a negative experience .
i will never return to chapman chevy ever !
i was asked to sit in the waiting room ( no problem ) .
would rate their service department a _num_ if we could .
the next weekend i went back for the oil change .
they gave me an inspection report but did n't explain anything on it .
there were too many screw ups for this to have been an isolated incident .
i added the wheel and tire protection plan at an additional fee .
i got a flat tire last friday .
then he said yes , but they are all taken .
once again i said forget it and i will take my business elsewhere .
unfortunately he does not offer protection on the tire for future damage .
kudos to them for checking the car out again at no cost .
but we still do n't know for sure that the radiator replacement was necessary .
this just shows how terrible this dealership really is .
i took my car in a few different times for an oil change .
there 's just no follow up .
after i left , they kept on calling me and calling me .
i will never purchase from another chevy dealership again .
_num_ different stories , and one or both are lies .
unfortunately after making a couple phone calls to managers , they do n't care .
so , i call and make an appointment .
at this point i had been waiting for a little over _num_ hours .
should have probably done it myself at home .
pretty disappointed for my 1st visit .
service consultant was rude and condescending .
but no .
the guy treated his co-workers poorly as well .
in _num_ i ordered a truck from chapman chevrolet .
nothing but trouble .
i have done business there for over _num_ years and am done now !
another staff member started yelling at him right in front of me .
and the worst of it was the two hour wait !
do i have to give them _num_ star ?
they do n't deserve it .
avoid any upcoming tent sales and chapman chevrolet .
i would not recommend anyone dealing with this company .
these people had to bring their vehicles back : ( such a bummer .
to get me into so they could a car sold .
i said no to the money any brought the car back .
so i get to go home without a car that i signed for .
worst customer service ever !
i got the feeling he could not care less .
- $ _num_ shop fee .
- unknown mystery fees that could not be explained .
how pathetic ?
i wish i would 've never dealt with this unorganized company .
scheduled a service appointment online , which was confirmed .
for _num_ minutes ... with nobody to help me .
total waste of my time.
eventually i just left .
_num_ stars .
um , why did i drive down there then ?
this has ruined my car buying experience completely .
i wish i had read these before buying my car here .
the bad reviews could n't be more accurate .
so many things wrong with this dealer .
expect to wait many hours for everything .
i ca n't imagine a dealer being any worse .
i was so irritated and frustrated !
but i will never spend my hard earned money at this establishment .
yes , the exact conditions described in the recall .
the power steering was working great , so long as the engine stayed on .
worst service rep ever .
after _num_ or _num_ minutes somebody directed me to this persons office .
now it is 11:30 and still no shuttle driver .
_num_ minutes later he called and said everything is ok it is ready .
if yelp allowed `` negative stars '' , i would use them .
sounds like jenny t & i had the same experience at chapman .
it lasted about _num_ months , when the same issue occurred again .
why on earth would we throw good money after bad on another gm product ?
finally , chapman called & said it was ready .
yep - you guessed it - did n't work .
we did n't even get out of the parking lot .
in addition , we are done buying gm .
no more chapman , no more gm .
i would not buy a car from here .
terrible customer service !
worst car service i 've ever had .
worst customer service ever .
oh hi hello i 'm sitting right here !
had two bad experiences with them more than _num_ years apart .
shoddy work and poor customer service .
horrible , shoddy , terrible work yet again .
i do n't usually write reviews , but these guys deserve this one .
nope just topped of the oil and gave it back .
will not be using this dealer again .
another thing is that i noticed that professionalism is not a thing here .
told me that would be $ _num_ .
this place is nothing but a joke .
please take this warning serious and buy your car somewhere else .
so i sit for another _num_ hours just to be told no .
they are worthless liars who like to waste your energy and time .
and i 'm sure in the long run thieves .
this dealer is a rip off !
if i could rate this _num_ stars i would .
my main issue here is the lack of integrity of this company .
they have completely lost my trust .
if that 's true , the management here really , really sucks .
even within warranty they asked for $ _num_ just to check what 's wrong !
i 'm done with chevy and seriously i will not touch another one .
i would never go back to this problem causing place ever again .
no i would not recommend this place nor a chevy .
next time i 'm bringing my attorney to buy a car .
its still a nice car but did n't get a deal in the end .
someone has to pay for the general managers gold and his obvious hefty appetite .
first time using the device department yesterday and it was not a good experience .
thus , i had to leave my car there all day .
second josh never called me all day to give me an update .
when i show up to get my car there is no one around .
they had it _num_ hours !
awful and annoying !
bad first impression .
so i told him i wanted my car back .
worse experience by far at any company ever .
by the way this is my first yelp review i 've ever done .
we have multiple salesman in my family and they despise people like them .
everyone car shopping ever stay clear of chapman chevrolet .
no call .
ok she is being an ass .
everyone is in trouble because of this one car .
i do n't know how else to explain it to her .
again i apologize we where trying to work with you .
proceed with caution .
after years of using the quick service area , i will not be returning .
one gentleman was very helpful .
big name car deal ... you would think they would have integrity !
i wish that i could give them a zero .
you probably see where this is going .
chapman chevy just quoted me brakes for my truck for $ _num_ .
they came down to $ _num_ .
guess where i 'm going next week .
we were there and had the absolute worst experience of our lives .
he was very surprised emily told me i was pre approved .
tyler at chapman told me i needed new brakes and quoted $ _num_ .
i wo n't be back to chapman .
this dealership is the worst .
the first time was a joke and not one person asked to help me .
the girl told me the _num_ % would last thru the weekend .
so now i 'm waiting ... again ... for a _num_ % .
completely disappointed !
stay away from chapman chevy !
good grief .
or they gave my number to companies that call me all the time .
i hate car sales company ethics .
just let me drive a car and get some value for it .
this was the worst experience of my life with a dealership .
worst experience ever would never bring a car back there again !
consistently garbage service .
terrible communication .
the way that the local dealership 's service dept handled it was sub par .
phone etiquette is terrible .
the only problem was that the cost of the repair was very high .
like , are you serious ?
not ready or available .
that is horrible .
i dropped my vehicle off tuesday at 8am as scheduled .
this was not acceptable to me .
probably would not go back to buy or service any of my vehicles .
i just finished reviewing precision fleet services and they got a _num_ !
poor service all the way around .
he said i should leave the car there until they looked at it .
i explained i have no other car or a way to get around .
so after having my car about _num_ hours , they did nothing !
sadly , this dealership has serious integrity issues , and i will not return .
it was a good price for a fairly new used car with low mileage .
more than a month later , the car still smells .
the worst !
we set an appt to drive two hours to see it the following saturday .
no wonder ppl love ford .
chapman chevrolet has decided to made very poor customer service decisions repeatedly .
they told me that the car was still not done .
really they chose an angry customer multiple times the past _num_ weeks .
by playing games with when they have totally ruined their reputation in my eyes .
horrible !
bad .
like really bad .
the drive thru was packed , so i walked in .
there was a line _num_ people deep , and no one taking any orders .
just a quick update - this kfc shut down just a few weeks ago .
i guess it was a bad idea .
the food was old and lacked taste .
old chicken becomes very chewy and i just gave up without finishing my meal .
just stopped in the drive thru for a quick lunch .
i was given fries instead of the coleslaw i ordered .
gross .
the bun was burned and had dirty grill marks all over it .
a piece of fried chicken that had been sitting somewhere for awhile .
coleslaw was the only part that was any good .
i 've gone twice the past few months and it has been horrible .
this place sucks .
this was not the kfc i use to know .
the food quality for the sandwich was terrible .
i feel ripped off .
terrible customer service , always out of chicken .
first off , bugs !
i went to this office once for my yearly exam .
needless to say i left the appointment in tears .
highly disappointed .
highly disappointed .
nice pool , terrible support and service after installation .
little to no instructions left on how to maintain pool after installation .
warranty issues are handled , but not without multiple calls .
they are disorganized and have very poor customer service .
furthermore , they could not find my third pair of shoes .
a week passed and he did not call me when he said he would .
they still had not located my shoes .
another week passed and again , i never got a call .
so , again , i called them .
that i was tired of waiting .
and i do n't pay attention to name brands .
i just buy what i like .
however i did know that i paid about $ _num_ for the shoes .
however , i was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation .
i would not recommend this business to anyone .
i arrive there and guy _num_ is not working .
so , guy _num_ tells me to come back again on tuesday .
i keep telling him , no , that he spoke with my hubby .
really , guy _num_ ?
his response was so curt and defensive that i was taken off guard .
at that point , i should 've taken my purse and left .
i told him that no sales tax is to be charged on labor .
he does n't deserve anybody 's business .
completely rude .
however , i will never use this service again .
no business skills at all .
like the other reviews had mentioned they are very disorganized , and completely rude .
its sad that people can actually run a business this way .
do not patronize this establishment .
horrible .
bad customer service .
the short jerk who took over is giving this place a bad name .
super rude and does crappy work .
i will never use their shoe repair services again .
both tips fell out before noon .
listen yelpers , this guy is rude and attempted to rip our shoes off !
rude and horrible customer service !
i have had them fix _num_ pairs of my shoes .
i am taking them elsewhere this time .
super rude and very unprofessional , never going back to him ever again !
wo n't see ya there .
this guy ruined a pair of my favorite shoes .
meanwhile , i am stuck with my favorite pair of shoes , ruined .
horrible business ... .
why did wayne have me drive all the way back ?
what a ridiculous waste of my time .
really disappointing service from a place i used to frequent .
a freaking week .
i did not check the inside of the shoes .
for that reason , i wo n't be back .
rude , unreasonable .
could n't even look up my name .
rude about the entire thing , unpleasant , and unprofessional .
it took _num_ months to schedule first time appointment .
no a fan .
i get blonde highlights on top and the rest is a dark chocolate brown .
i came here for an eyebrow wax awhile back and was unimpressed .
i would not go back .
altered ego obviously has an altered sense of the word `` appointment '' .
eh ?
she trimmed it again and proceeded to do the color .
never will i return again .
my first ( and last ) appointment with altered ego was yesterday .
no big deal .
i just want a haircut . ''
boy , was i wrong .
unfortunately , that punch line never came .
the whole experience was disappointing .
they 'll have nothing to do with you when you complain .
i was assured that would be no problem .
i will not be returning .
all this did was turn my roots gold .
however , i will not be returning .
i wasted my money .
i keep falling for high reviews and end up disappointed .
what was a perfect day was ruined by horrible customer service .
i was given a $ _num_ gift card at the bridal show .
i 'm escorted to the front desk and get prepared to pay .
i leave sit in my car and look at the gift card .
i was n't looking for the style to be free .
also do n't hand out fake gift cards that mean nothing !
i 'm disappointed .
which was fine , whatever .
get _num_ % off '' etc etc .
could n't reach anyone .
so now you lost me as a customer .
stop sending me emails that you want me back .
if you want to bake while you work out , this is the place .
only a/c turned on in the mornings , is in the weight area .
get your act together _num_ hour fitness !
thats kind of deceiving to potential new customers .
the old stuff is n't noticed as easily .
tempe is still the neglected one .
just joined this gym a week ago ... not impressed at all .
i know i would never recommend this gym to anyone else .
i 've been to quite a few _num_ hour fitness gyms .
yes , this has all the equipment you need for cardio and weights .
, and equipment is down for maintenance fairly regularly .
it 's literally stopped me from getting my morning swim in .
got a hassle every single time i 've tried to check in .
not going to tolerate it one more time .
equipment is old and is not well maintained .
at last count they only had _num_ out of _num_ bikes working .
locker room is dirty .
_num_ % of the showers do n't work .
soap dispenser was empty for _num_ days .
staff does not seem to care .
avoid this place .
for many , many months prior , all the bikes were taken by 8:30 .
i wish this company would get their act together .
this gym is the worst i have encountered in terms of facility renovations needed .
why is my gym not open for _num_ hours ?
ok guys , i have been coming here for about _num_ months now .
equipment is old but works great .
really disappointed .
i walked into the gym on march 30th to begin a life change .
not kidding .
how absurd is that ?
not my fault you 're money hungry because your sessions are ridiculously overpriced .
its kinda dingy and lacking equipment but is close to home .
he said he could cancel it but i would have to pay _num_ $ .
very disappointed with this gym .
this place is not clean and the front desk is not friendly whatsoever .
the _num_ or _num_ available all had out of order signs on them .
for a commercial gym this place is so poorly maintained !
it is not accurate to report this as closed .
i do not like this target .
expect less , pay more !
so it 's $ _num_ .
i wish there was a way to comment about the pharmacy alone .
it sure was great using the target pharmacy before they switched over .
there customer service i feel is not very good at all .
i would not recommend .
i tried repeatedly to contact the manager to no avail .
lack luster service here .
brought the pizza back and received the wrong pizza again .
horrible experience .
warning -- they take no responsibility for their work .
absolutely the worst service i have ever seen .
avoid at all costs .
two weeks later i noticed oil stains in my garage where i park .
loved how they worked with me all the years ive gone to them .
made an appointment online at _num_ am for an oil change at _num_ am .
website said i would receive a phone call to verify my appointment .
no phone call .
they call me _num_ minutes later and tell me my truck is ready .
every other place does includes these services .
i checked my oil and it was clean .
he told me to come down and he would have it fixed .
i show up and craig was very helpful .
probably not .
they have horrible customer service and have shady business practices .
overall horrible experience on all levels please save yourself the headache of coming here .
customer service is terrible .
they refused to replace the screw even though they were at fault again .
there is more , but i am tired of typing .
horrible service .
minimum _num_ minute wait for everything at this place .
i ended up driving back later and they immediately put it back in .
rates here seem higher than other places .
they quoted me almost $ _num_ .
i had all _num_ tires replaced here .
i checked it and they did not put in enough oil .
i 'm full and disappointed .
i ordered shrimp egg foo young and crispy orange tofu .
it was not hot or spicy as the menu indicated .
there 's was n't anything promising about the meal .
the worst is this : they use styrofoam for everything .
makes me sick to my stomach .
i am tempted to give them _num_ star for this reason .
this was god awful .
the chicken was fat with some skin and flavorless sauce .
somehow , they messed up the rice too .
but , really , do n't .
no idea how this has such good reviews .
the rice was dry .
the chicken with broccoli was bland and way too creamy .
wo n't be ordering from here again .
i was going between it and another place -- what a mistake .
i ordered sweet and sour chicken and moo shu veggies .
i 'm not kidding , actual tortillas .
the quality of the chicken was the worst .
it was a waste of _num_ bucks !
edible , but not good at all .
egg foo young -- overwhelmingly garlicky .
but , not finding a menu online , we went with this place .
big , $ _num_ , mistake .
but one item can not really do the trick .
but sometimes i would get different containers .
a large would be a med , and med would be a small .
some days i had left overs , others i was still pretty hungry .
compared to other us cities , this place ranks very low in my book .
so you can imagine our disappointment .
the chunks were sparse , to say the least .
moving on to the fried rice : i have never tasted anything so bland .
maybe the crab puff would be good ?
the last attempt to find something edible was the egg roll .
the sweet and sour chicken is hit and miss .
when its good it 's tasty but when it 's bad it 's terrible .
the eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste .
after waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing !
probably wo n't be back , bummer .
i was totally wrong ... .
the veggies were blah ... .
the crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls ... .
they were horrible ... !
the worst egg rolls i ever ate in my life ... .
the rice was dry and disgusting ... .
this is my second order , and by accident .
and chicken and veg for myself as i only eat chicken fish and turkey .
the food was bland , dry and luke warm .
the fried rice is the worst i ever tasted .
salty , and dry .
she offered to refund my money forty min ago .
if you 're thinking about placing an order , do n't waste your money .
ok they delivered my refund .
but not before i received my two subs from jimmy johns .
it was n't at all good or even remotely satisfying .
even the chinese place i go to while im baked is better .
the food was bad too .
as late night i mean baked the fuck out of your head .
mediocre .
thankfully , tempe has an abundance of chinese food outlets ; goodbye !
she was a little rude but i dealt with it .
this place sucked .
got the orange chicken , hunan beef , and chicken chow mien .
the orange chicken was the worst i 've ever had .
not crispy or breaded .
just soggy .
really , all of it sucked except the rice .
but i ate it .
egg rolls were okay and the crab puffs were great but tiny .
disgusting !
there is too much breading on their `` crispy '' teriyaki chicken .
i ordered sweet and sour chicken , and he ordered crunchy chicken teriyaki .
both came with fried rice , an eggroll and a crab puff .
we did n't really like any of it .
this place was n't very good .
hot and sour soup tasted off .
crab rangoon was ok.
eggroll did n't taste good .
negative _num_ stars !
hope i do n't get sick !
fortune cookies were good .
they seem nice enough but the food is bad even by take out standards .
my chicken was over salted and so much mushy breading .
the portion is unbelievably small , chicken is dry .
_num_ of them got sick and most of the food was thrown out .
bad .
i 've given this place _num_ chances .
the prices are too high and the food is bland .
my usual place does n't deliver so i decided to try their food .
it tasted off and the ingredients were mushy .
it took forever and they gave me moldy chicken .
very disappointed .
they 're not very express and give you no chopsticks !
i probably wo n't order from them again .
okay why not ! ''
i chose orange chicken , sweet and sour pork , and chicken chow mien .
delivery guy was friendly and all went well until i checked out the food .
it was edible , but not what i was really craving .
the fried rice is white rice with a sauce .
egg rolls were good but a little mushy .
overall , i would probably never order from here again .
its truly awful .
wonton soup looked and tasted like dirty dish water .
id give it negative stars if i could .
it was bland and horrible texture .
their fried rice equally bland .
chow mein however did pack a punch of garlic flavor .
disgusting .
i really liked that they delivered quickly , which was a plus .
next time i 'm in town , i 'll order elsewhere .
i ca n't believe i 'm considered a regular here .
service is lame to pathetic .
no apologies .
and there is rita 's too .
i ordered the pumpkin pie blizzard and it was horrible .
ended up throwing it away in the trash .
i was not impressed by this dairy queen .
when we asked how long , we were told _num_ mins .
by the time his food came , i was done with my ice cream .
the hamburger was not that great .
i do n't know why i keep going back here for waxing or nails .
i will not go to this place anymore .
this place sucks .
i made a yelp account as i wait for my food at this place .
she said it would be _num_ minutes wait for it .
damn my craving for fried chicken .
the staff is always very impersonal and act put out to serve you .
today 's meal was not very good .
the chicken was too dry and cooked too long .
worse the employees do n't wash their hands after using the rest room .
horrible wait times !
worst customer service ever .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
the girls there are not friendly .
and if you ask to have a fresh one made they noticeably seem annoyed .
on a whim i stopped here for some chicken .
sorry , not coming back here !
of chicken i 'm not ever coming back .
pretty disgusted and wo n't be going back to this location .
no wonder !
horrible .
_num_ min later he yelled across the bar that our food was ready .
this is honestly the worst service i have ever had .
i will not be back .
this place has really gone downhill .
we used to live nearby , and came here regularly for karaoke .
avoid this place , there are better bars not far away .
i will never step foot back into this place .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
my friends and i went here last night wanting to do some karaoke .
next time do n't make me chase you down . ''
ummm , excuse me !
this was so disrespectful the way she talked to me as a new customer .
there obviously will not be a `` next time . ''
strike _num_ .
horrible .
it was n't even busy so sucks for them to lose out on customers .
it reeked of urine so bad we did n't even bother sitting down !
awful , awful smell .
this was hands down the worst business i have visited in _num_ .
did n't even make it past the phone call .
do n't waste your time .
that was enough to turn me away permanently .
what a mistake .
i do n't want to do business with people who treat employees like that .
unprofessional and useless .
bottom line , there are better , less expensive options out there .
the staff moving in was horrendous .
the staff now is so green one can not even reason with them .
for the money you 'll spend here one can get so much more .
run , do n't walk , from this complex .
the people suck and do not care about residents .
they charge ridiculous fees when they are the ones who made the mistake .
i wish i had never agreed to a yr at this place .
i lived here for one year and that was way too long .
this place is not pet friendly .
it 's ridiculous !
do not live here !
the worst apartment !
that 's not our fault !
the worst apartment !
worse apartments ever !
i wish i had listened to the other reviewers .
do n't make the mistake of living here .
super slow !
if you are in any kind of hurry do n't go here .
the drive through is soooooo slow .
everyone loves starbucks , but sadly at this location has terrible customer service .
i walked in , no welcome or anything like everyone usually gets .
highly disappointed .
i 'm not one to complain about it being too cold , but seriously .
the beverage literally took me less than a couple of minutes to finish .
i definitely feel like i wasted my money here .
i have never really been impressed with trader joes .
i find them to be over priced and lacking variety .
i guess i might be happier if i were a meat eater .
i am a vegetarian , who even when i ate meat , hated fish .
what , how weird ... i 'm used to seeing the nuts but fish ?
wish i could give it no stars .
the last time i shopped there was the last straw .
the clerk said and did nothing .
both ignored me .
and that was the last time trader joe 's got any of my money .
their brussel sprouts ( on the stock ) gave me food poisoning .
i was very sick for _num_ days .
never will i buy any fresh veggies from them again .
whoa trader joe 's .
so i went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch .
she went and get the _num_ yr old baker .
if you read this review , please also read nathan 's comment below .
however , the new management sucks .
apparently the other baked goods like the scones , muffins , etc .
are from scratch , but the croissants themselves are not .
we were wrong .
we walked in and it was relatively busy .
there was enough to really gross me out .
the bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything .
the croissants were decent , but there was nothing particularly special about them .
that does n't mean they wo n't be delicious !
the hubs got himself a chocolate bavarian cream croissant .
i was sorely disappointed !
i mean , this was some really , really old jelly .
the hub 's choice was not much better .
that is not their problem .
whatever you do , do not order a breakfast sandwich .
it does n't taste good and it 's not healthy .
they need to focus on making better breakfast food to compliment the croissants .
then i went to day and more then likely will never go back !
it was not flaky at all and very little taste .
not at all like i had remembered them to be .
not even close to what a croissant should taste like .
very bland .
the vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well .
what a waste of time .
so i just quickly ordered one and paid .
she then threw my quiche in a microwave .
are n't you a bakery ?
seriously ... what is wrong with this bakery ?
they microwave their food and the staff is awful .
wo n't come here again .
i 've tried going back several times over the last few years .
so why go to a place that blows off your order ?
i do n't normally write bad , but holy poop !
next time will go get a crepe next door .
very over priced and quality is way down from childhood days !
it 's just unfortunate that they are next to a fantastic french restaurant .
it just does not compare and the croissants are ok .
not even service could save them ... .
i dont understand a restaurant that always runs out of food before lunch time .
nothing special .
the veggies were what really got my goat though .
the menu says the sandwich comes with bell pepper , onion , and mushroom .
there was more egg than anything .
not to mention all the people that have handled it without washing their hands .
so , long story short , we will not be returning .
like the third time i 've been here and they are out of croissants .
kind of disappointing that you drive over and they are always sold out .
that croissant was more like bread .
it was not flakey , airy , buttery .
even the almond flavor was off .
what arrived was the chocolate chip filled one .
went in to see croissants that appeared about 1/3 smaller and almost flat .
just very bummed .
do n't think i 'd ever have a reason to go back .
too bad .
i ordered a croissant with no veggies sausage and cheese iced chai latte .
no big deal it happens i 'm sure they used bagged ice .
wo n't be back .
they microwaved my croissant on a styrofoam plate .
i will not eat food microwaved on styrofoam .
however , he did n't know how to blend coffee .
he told me that once it melts , i could drink it .
you are better off eating at a panda express in the projects .
it had veggies , chicken , pork and shrimp .
i would go again if invited , but not by choice .
horrible horrible horrible !
maintenance was called each time and the phone was shut off .
finally they responded and said they would fix it while i was at work .
neither of the dishes were really that great .
maybe i 'm biased but this place is just okay .
my boyfriend and i decided to get some takeout tonight from them .
mine was plain terrible .
literally no flavor or spice in fact .
ben got chicken fried rice , and the pan fried shrimp .
he said the fried rice was terrible , shrimp was average .
steamed rice was kinda crunchy , just your average quick cook rice .
hit and miss .
my bad .
what a hot mess that was .
not in a good way .
there was no flavor .
she did n't know what to make of it .
i felt bad for recommending it .
it was such a let down .
i said no and drove off .
had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in tempe .
it just was n't anything to write home about .
i was a former wong 's fan .
none of them were great .
i 'm not really sure that i like wong 's place .
the egg drop soup came back and it was okay .
so i asked for wonton instead .
both times i had wong jo chicken as a lunch special .
i was n't really feeling it on my second visit .
i tasted most everyone 's entrees and was n't really all that impressed .
the accompanying photo is of the wong jo chicken from my first visit .
i 'm not really feeling wong 's place .
again , very awkward .
i guess i wo n't be coming back .
the spare ribs were awful and nothing at all like chinese pork !
i really think panda express is a lot better than this .
no big deal it was n't in my food .
i am sorry to say i still have a hard time with rice .
but not from this place .
it is much too bad because i loved this place .
wong 's chicken was not crisp .
the dumplings were under cooked .
the singapore noodles were n't bad and they were n't great either .
not enough curry or spice oils , so not enough heat .
by comparison , wong 's jr .
extremely disappointed .
the food is basically flavor less and the meat quality is sub par .
i wo n't recommend it .
no wonder people will think chinese food is very unhealthy .
the food is really bad .
food was horrible for all _num_ guests in our party .
everything was served cold and had clearly been reheated .
not even remotely fresh .
server did not listen to anything we said as we ordered and seemed irritated .
i love to support small businesses but this was a really bad meal .
why take orders only to cancel .
what a lousy way to handle paying customers !
probably some of the worse chinese food i have had .
ordered the house chicken since it seemed to be a favorite by the reviews .
the chicken was plain and sauce tasted like sweet burnt garbage .
ate maybe five bites then threw the rest out .
it would be nice if info was shared that they are closed !
had their buffet _num_ years ago .
tables were greasy , floors were dirty .
unless their management has changed since then , i will not go back .
it does not even deserve the one star .
the place was mess .
one of the potstickers i had tasted like it was made with rotten meat .
the hot and sour soup was awful .
please save yourselves the trouble and eat somewhere else .
this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
i repeat , the worst ever .
the food was oily and flavorless and the selections were limited and mostly breaded .
instead , i was stuck with dry tilapia and flavorless salmon .
how can anyone f up such a standard dish ?
horrid , horrid .
i imagine it probably tasted full of chemicals , too .
run , do n't walk away from this place .
panda express is a five-star restaurant compared to this place .
as i said before : run , do n't walk away from this place !
the food was sub-par and cheap .
i will not eat at this establishment again .
many familiar choices ( if you 've been to a chinese buffet before .
mostly , i 'd say this was due to the lack of customers .
i was also not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant .
as a chinese buffet , i 've had both better and worse .
much worse .
i would consider going back , but it would n't be my first choice .
will not be going back .
have no idea why my dad picked this place for his bday .
i can see some of it was raw seafood , not too good .
disgusting !
i would give it zero stars if i could .
after paying , we were seated and the table was filthy .
we got up and demanded our money back .
then they tried to keep the money for the sodas .
this is where we always go and where we should have gone that night .
the register person asked me for $ _num_ when i stepped up .
california roll looked ok , though old as the avocado had turned black .
he replied `` no english '' .
heat for lo mein on arrival at the table was lukewarm .
wasabi was probably not fresh , certainly not hot .
there was no way i could continue .
she just told him to sit on the other side .
i waited a 1/2 hr still no crab legs .
food was not very good and tables dirty .
sadly , they would have a better review years ago .
this was not a surprise .
some were even empty .
i just about fell out my seat .
mediocre food .
food was cold , it was bland and i would never go here again .
it was filthy dirty .
so so so gross .
however , the condition of the place is my issue .
there were way too many kids running , literally , back and forth .
ate here last night for the first time .
wo n't go back .
i tried the sushi and regretted it immediately .
i was thankful i did n't get sick .
you would be better off going to panda express .
i will not be returning .
first off , the place was dirty .
the food was `` okay '' , nothing special .
i do n't even want to give one star !
services bad , restroom was so nasty !
this was our first and last visit to this restaurant .
which i could give this place no stars because this is disgusting .
place has no pride of ownership .
ripped seats , sticky floors , food has little to no flavor .
do i want to sit in a ripped seat ?
am i that desperate for your food ?
these guys have no clue .
smh food wasnt all that .
i barely finished my first plate .
this place has gone bad .
do not eat this !
the pizza was a request from a customer i was trying to impress .
i would not order from this location again .
the pizza delivered was not what i ordered .
a greasy pool of tiny chicken nuggets .
not at all what i ordered .
ok , first off i love pizza hut pizza .
i 'm still waiting for a pizza i ordered _num_ mins ago .
do n't get delivery from here .
if u do do n't tip .
are you kidding me ?
awful service and worse staff .
the worst dining experience i have had in over _num_ years .
the manager had no control over the staff or the experience to manage anyone !
i 'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend and we pulled up to this location .
it 's annoying .
chicken was not great seemed to be sitting to long .
wo n't come to this location again .
getting it wrong from what i read is there specialty .
music going but no one home .
this shit is awful .
i feel bad that this company represents louisiana in any culinary form .
also , learn to fucking count .
beyond rude staff !
yet again , cold and flavorless .
in short , i wo n't be going back here .
this place is the absolute worst at customer service & speed .
this place was awful .
the soda was flat , the mashed potatoes were a disgrace .
the best part was the buttery biscuit and the cajun fries .
thoroughly disappointed with the entire experience .
damn you ace .
have n't been here in quite a while .
i was greeted by a friendly employee .
ace lost my business today .
too bad , i would love to support locally operated ace .
worst customer service i have ever received .
i guess they really do n't care about their honest customers and their concerns .
the first are _num_ cents each and the new ones are _num_ cents each .
so by all accounts a _num_ difference would be about _num_ cents .
her total $ _num_ .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
seriously i would not take a bug here if they were dying .
some of the staff rude .
dr would n't call .
she sounded _num_ .
very disappointed .
disappointed .
i feel like this should have been an easy find from a vet .
will not be returning .
first off , most of the staff i met were very nice .
but the vet i ended up with was horrible .
my cat was drooling and i was scared that her teeth were bad .
she was just laying down on the counter .
they were pushing for me to get it scheduled immediately .
i left without scheduling an appointment and started cleaning my cats teeth at home .
they did n't even talk to me about her being slightly over weight .
fail .
soggy french fries fail .
how do you f up fries ?
customer service fail .
its crap imo .
`` no we do n't serve breakfast til _num_ am !
one of the worst quick lunches i 've ever had .
the burger was dry , the bacon was burnt , and the sauce .
not on my burger .
and this was not the the burger for that .
which was kinda on the flat side .
not my idea of a good burger joint for lunch .
just had to give our drive thru order _num_ times to the same person !
yes , _num_ times .
people behind the counter look at me like i 'm a problem .
i did n't even bother w the drive thru after that .
i 'm not picky .
those two condiments probably saved me from dying of food poisoning .
yelp , i can not think of the words necessary to express my disappointment .
why the hell would i want my fish shredded ?
on top of that the flavors were just bad .
it was either canned , or just not fresh .
why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice ?
it does n't bring me comfort to know they are n't cooking anything fresh .
for mexican food , and terrible mexican food at that !
it is an unbelievable little place .
i could not believe it !
i will not be back !
this place does not even compare .
a total rip off !
ate here last week with a friend she liked her lava bowl of soup .
i had fish tacos that you could tell was frozen .
i wo n't be back .
this guy does n't provide the prescription as he 's not a doctor .
very poor customer service .
he did n't have a desk assistant , when i visited him .
i do n't trust this company and would n't recommend them to a friend .
if only yelp offered negative star ratings .
it turned out to be a terrible purchase .
really awful customer service .
battery chains are a dime a dozen .
is this radio shack even selling anything or is everyone constantly out to lunch ?
they do n't seem scheduled .
if they 're scheduled , change the hours of operation to reflect that .
_num_ stars on service , _num_ stars on availability .
edit : my girlfriend just pointed out the `` now hiring '' sign .
i had a tamale the first time and it was dry and oily .
so do n't go there unless you want terrible service .
my husband likes them , i do n't .
the place was not too busy .
not cheap .
the taco was just ok.
the chicken was tasty , and the lettuce was crisp .
there was a little cheese in there too .
it tasted cheesy .
the enchilada sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown .
i 'm not an enchilada expert but i 've had better .
this cheese enchilada was flat and i could not taste any onions .
my husband and i ordered the tamale , taco combo plate with green chili .
there was no flavor at all in anything on the plate .
my husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid .
not to mention it was lacking cheese .
also ordered a chicken chimichanga .
i wish los taquitos would have been open at this hour !
gross .
was i wrong ... .
you know , the kind you can get at all other normal mexican restaurants ?
we ask if we can put anything else in it and she says no .
i left full , but unhappy .
and they do n't even have carne asada , its ground beef .
not a fan .
it is really a miracle that they could made such boring mexican fare .
but the food certainly is not worth the visit .
if i wanted a large taco , i would have ordered a large taco .
i probably should have read some reviews before ordering .
i literally walked out without eating .
service was what you would expect from a burrito joint , nothing stellar .
should we talk about their beef / chicken ?
i dunno .
veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese .
this was a _num_ '' tortilla with cheese , sour cream and raw onion .
michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold .
_num_ minutes later , michelle picked up again and asked if i could hold .
i asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady .
instead , i 'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever .
i 'll pay more for quality , not to stick it to the man .
the service is horrible at this place !
it was really nothing special .
i should know better than to stray from america 's taco shop .
so i ordered the carne asada burrito .
maybe _num_ % carne asada .
but i only noticed from the texture .
sure did n't taste it .
but still only so so compared to what i am used to getting .
they were not particularly busy , maybe 10-15 % capacity .
no priority for to-go orders .
it ruined it for me .
my child , like most kids , will only eat very plain items .
definitely nothing special about this place .
in the end we wrote it off as a one time , bad day .
i can assume that is why that visit went off without a hitch .
it 's why i do n't eat at fast food restaurants often .
so if you peel the layers away its really not that big .
every thing tasted ok but didnt blow me away .
my boyfriend and i stopped by after hearing a lot of hype .
very bland taste .
honestly , i would rather run through a filibertos .
we were there yesterday , we walked in , the place was a mess !
they asked _num_ times , yes _num_ times could we have are table cleaned .
needless to say i was very disappointed .
even the food was disappointing .
enough said , we would n't be returning .
i 'm not a big fan of this style of mexican food .
all i saw was the corn tortilla and sauce on my enchilada .
my enchilada was tasteless with just a tortilla and the meat and sauce .
the tasted bland .
and i did n't like this .
quality control needs to be taken care of .
wow , they could not have disappointed me more if they had tried !
guess not .
the customer service sucked .
what a mess .
wo n't be back .
and it was bad .
really , really bad .
$ _num_ and i feel like i just ordered a salt lick .
hell no .
that food was just nasty .
i had tacos here and the meat was really dry .
i have spoken to the manager before and no one seems to care .
a lot of my friends have already stopped coming for this reason .
yet , with each visit i am more disappointed .
flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that .
oh filibertos you were such a disappointment tonight !
it took _num_ minutes for our order to come out .
crappy customer service .
the potatoes were obviously the frozen kind and the chorizo was subpar .
they did n't even get the horchata right , too sweet .
wo n't be visiting again .
i enjoy a lot of mexican food and this was definitely disappointing .
very incompetent employees working tonight .
i like that this filiberto 's is _num_ hours .
when we got home there was no salsa .
: ( we looked for the receipt , but could n't find it .
from now on i am always checking before we leave .
keep your receipt too in case you are missing half of what you ordered .
the chips are burning hot and melt the containers together .
not vegetarian .
in any case they just lost a long time customer .
i should have stopped sooner , oh well lesson learned .
not worth the hassle of trying to deal with these people .
unfortunately it has come to this .
potatoes in my az burrito were uncooked , almost as if raw .
has got to be the worse mcdonalds i have ever been too .
the seats were falling apart .
their sweet tea taste like sewer water and it 's not even sweet .
had to toss it .
their fries are not salty whatsoever and it 's so dry .
do n't go here , there 's wendy 's next door .
been a patron at rubio 's for a long time ; this one included .
this evening had my worst experience ever .
i ended up getting sick anyway , though .
i ordered the citrus salad tonight with shrimp .
it was gross !
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
worst service ever .
my windows look all bubbly and horrible .
i should have gotten my money back .
very disappointing .
_num_ star because i did n't even get an appointment .
horrible customer service !
they were rude , short and completely unpleasant to deal with .
do not skip over it !
first of all , i do n't have a dog .
pathetic .
luckily for me , i save my receipts .
i really like chinese and thai food but this just does n't measure up .
bland and not even similar to thai red curry .
if you want thai food hit royal thai grill or thai rama .
stop by and give them a try you wo n't be disappointed .
, oyster sauce or both , thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians .
found out it was not on the second .
tott 's fails to make the effort .
you wo n't be disappointed .
i do n't really get why this place has so many good reviews .
overall , not horrible food but i doubt i will eat here again .
even the cook gave me an attitude .
the guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried .
my girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said , nothing special .
really , it was nothing to warrant even _num_ stars in my opinion .
`` like the river flow into the sea .
the food was n't that good but that was n't my main issue .
i will not be returning .
the owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and i .
the total was $ _num_ which seemed reasonable .
it was just way too sweet and lacking flavor .
food was ok , not awesome .
not a good first impression .
you will see that there is n't a difference in the taste .
_num_ people on staff at the time , all were standing around talking .
one was still cold in the middle .
overall , if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you .
sorry tots , i wanted to like you .
nasty and missing something .
fried rice was bland and old .
noticed _num_ employees eating lunch and they had pizza from another restaurant ?
there are way better choices around that area , no need to go back .
sad sad sad excuse for a cream cheese wonton .
it 's simple ; are there frozen peas and carrots used in the rice ?
the portion was huge , the veggies were fresh .
the owner , i am truly disappointed in .
apparently they consider chicken powder to be vegetarian .
if we had not already paid , i would have left .
thanks for the unpleasant experience .
the place was clean , not too crowded and the greeting was friendly .
everything tastes over processed .
very disappointed with the orange chicken and walnut shrimp .
will not be going back .
i 've been here _num_ times .
the orange chicken tastes nothing like orange chick it bland .
the pad tai was really bad , i could n't even eat half .
but sorry to say this place is nothing special .
got the red curry lunch with veggies , tofu , and brown rice .
not limp , crispy without being too raw .
trouble was the curry .
i 'm the wrong person to ask .
i also tried the chicken pot stickers .
i may be back the next time my son bugs me for pei wei .
tried the stir fry crispy beef and the spicy island chicken .
the chicken tastes horrible , dry and flavorless .
horrible management .
this is most certainly the worse chinese i have had in az .
i would honestly describe this food as a really bad pei wei knock off .
sorry - but we wo n't be going back to this place .
its already disrespect enough you are in this country .
so unless you want the establishment to be shut down .
decided to try something new tonight so we ordered takeout here .
take out should n't be that hard .
yeah i walked in to get it , but the result is the same .
if it was possible to give this place no stars i would .
it was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy .
the taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor .
the flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing .
too bad , because i really wanted to like it too .
avoid !
so gross !
i saw someone else mention food poisoning with this place too .
the worst food ever .
please do n't waste your time going here .
was craving singapore noodles .
just boiled rice vermicelli .
no lemongrass or nothing thai about it .
dragon noodle , tasted like wax .
they did n't seem to bother about it .
just said they will let the chef know .
all we can taste was the sticky greasy noodles , pepper sauce .
we also ordered sesame chicken and orange chicken .
it was pure dark fatty batter coated sesame and orange chicken !
and never come back to this place ever again .
this second review is really unfortunate for me to have to post .
sad to say , i cancelled my order and will take my business elsewhere .
that was not my point .
they also inform me of delivery times and fees up front .
i am all for local , so do n't get me wrong .
not so .
`` shame on him .
what happened to my review ?
such a disappointment .
so , i paid just under a hundred dollars for dead flowers .
they should change and hire a real company .
the technician who came , did not come prepared .
awkward .
keep in mind , this is still under warranty .
she told me that i need to have my freezer checked out .
refused to even send out a technician to check .
this has not happened before i got this system .
they 'll get your money , and then treat you like garbage .
cheap company that does n't want to do anything extra .
in the two years i 've had this system it has never worked properly .
absolute junk !
the follow through in the office is terrible .
is too hard to get a hold of .
system is not the best !
terribly disappointed .
i called the office and talked to samantha .
she sent an email and estimated _num_ hours labor .
no appointment was made so i had to call the office back again .
_num_ days later .
then _num_ hours labor at $ _num_ an hour .
ridiculous !
i was not until the next week again .
do not use these folks for plumbing .
very disappointed on the time i wasted .
very poor customer service .
took me a month to get saturday appointment .
her tone of customer service is worst .
go spend your money to somewhere who will value you as customer .
clearly you do not have a++ rating ) ?
i always always get terrible customer service at this location .
if the tellers are not extremely awkward , they are being rude .
she gave me a dirty look and went to ask her manager .
i have opened my kids accounts elsewhere and have been thinking about switching .
zero stars !
i paid for my order and ate one wing at home .
wings were bland with little to no sauce .
just do n't bother going !
very bland wings .
ordered _num_ hot wings .
forced to pay _num_ to use a debit card .
wings were done in _num_ mins .
i like the menu for dennys however this particular dennys is not that great .
the food tasted good , but everything else about dinner tonight was awful .
terrible !
for someone working on tips you 'd think they would do a good job .
_num_ minutes to get some water .
everytime we go to this dennys we have nothing but problems .
the staff never check on you .
it was horrible .
i really do n't like the way they run this place at all .
the first one was good but this one was horrible .
this is by far the worst denny 's i 've ever been to .
it 's not like they were busy .
to top it off the cashier we paid with was so rude .
she pretty much ruined my life .
service is awful at this location .
lackluster food .
lackluster and mediocre service .
not recommended at all .
horrible experience !
we sat for a total of _num_ minutes and we were never acknowledged .
everything else has always been a bit dry or bland .
do not eat here .
the food here is the worst chinese food we have ever tasted .
my girlfriend and i took one bite of our dinner and left .
garbage , junk and complete trash .
wish we could give this zero stars .
the place was empty so we had many seating options .
none of the tables were clean .
the napkin came up black , and this is not even an exaggeration .
but we could n't eat the soup .
general tso 's chicken was absolutely dreadful .
the won tons served with it were stale .
terrible terrible .
a lot can change in a year , and not for the good !
i used to think this place was decent , but no longer .
the sweet and sour chicken was anything but .
i am not sure what happened to this place .
it did n't taste like kung pao chicken .
i could n't finish it .
i see people walk in to eat but i never see them leave .
a co-worker said i should try here .
i 'm not sure he was talking about the same restaurant .
i walked in and there was just a guy asleep at the counter .
i have been treated nicely but then other times staff was pretty rude .
they have cheap prices but they seem to be pretty messy consistently .
i guess it depends on the day or the technician you get .
she refused to refund me and hung up on me .
very bad customer service .
they rush in and rush u out .
if you want fancy this is not the place .
very busy place and i question the cleanliness .
wish i could say the same about the staff .
do n't bother wasting your time !
service was way below my already low standards !
but hey , they 're finally taking all _num_ major credit cards !
what a horrible checkout procedure .
it 's like constantly buying things from best buy at christmas .
it 's been hard to find something with the same tip .
i tried one , which was wrong .
it then took another _num_ minutes to return my one item .
after that disaster was finally over , i headed to find another replacement .
they just looked at me and said `` no .
do you need help with anything else '' as they walked away .
not that they 'd care .
i 'm sorry .
this has not been my experience at all .
and i miss it .
fry 's is a consistent disappointment .
two major problems .
their on-line inventory look up has been wrong every time i have used it .
i drive myself over there to find an empty shelf .
the check-out line is always long ( or worse ) .
help varies greatly from very useful to completely useless .
i hate to even give _num_ star to this location .
the sales associate sold us a product that did not include the package advertised .
i had plenty of money , it was n't about getting something for free .
it just looks nicer when you walk in than it used to .
props for nothing else though .
and they are either following you around , or avoiding you .
its pathetic really .
this is n't costco !
it 's the only reason i could n't do everything online .
i was very disappointed with fry 's last night .
it will probably be many more years before i visit them again .
they now price match all online pricing .
average prices , cheap products .
how else was i going to find out that it was defective , esp ?
probably more like a _num_ , or _num_ out of _num_ .
i 've never walked in there and come out with what i wanted .
every time i shop at frys , they are able to disappoint me further .
said no thanks and threw it in the trash .
last straw for this horrible place to shop .
shopping cart wo n't work - i keep getting an error .
she says `` oh i got an error . ''
she does it again from the beginning ... error again .
same result error .
wait _num_ minutes and the box comes up .
agent tells me that not all items are on the same price .
goes to talk to someone and _num_ minutes later comes back and says no .
_num_ more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks .
guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute and leaves .
ridiculous !
walked out completely empty handed and drove home .
not a pleasant experience , and will not be a return customer .
not that they are all like that , of course .
customer service was terrible , and insulting !
for me , it was a cheap chinese remote control helicopter .
the thing never even left the ground .
$ _num_ , down the drain .
hands down , the worst experience i have ever had .
thats when things turned ugly .
it was really awkward and very unprofessional !
way less hassle and better quality goods .
this was _num_ of the rare times i went to frys .
if they had _num_ stars , that 'd be my rating .
_num_ check out lanes and _num_ people working with a line _num_ customers deep .
you have i walk to the food section and enter .
even though they have like _num_ checkout registers , only _num_ will be open .
why do i torture myself by coming to this store ?
there were two different colors out on display with prices listed .
worst costumer service and after purchased service .
i just had the worst experience i have ever had at a retail store .
absolutely horrible experience all around .
they advertise items and then do n't honor the ad .
they claim it 's a mistake in printing .
management should be ashamed to not honor their ads .
i will not be shopping at this shady operation anymore .
the tv went white screen on me dec _num_ .
my daughter and i paid cash for a laptop computer .
we paid cash and should have walked out with cash .
this is totally ridiculous !
did n't need anything fancy , just a good product .
i try not to go here unless i can help it .
the customer service here is worse than you 'll find anywhere .
on one occasion , a female employee was typing away at a computer .
the associate i was connected to immediately told me they were all out .
sure enough , they had a whole shelf full .
i placed my order online , but they did not offer delivery .
when i got there , low and behold they did n't have my tv .
these people are dishonest & unprofessional .
my boyfriend and i went in the store this evening and received bad service .
this is the worst !
this place basically sucks .
there were more than _num_ people waiting and there were _num_ cashiers .
i 'm standing there for _num_ minutes and the line has barely moved .
lol , now i am glad i left that ridiculous waiting line .
what the hell is wrong with the employees here ?
... i hate having to shop here !
coming to this place is always slightly disappointing .
unacceptable .
they would get a negative rating from me if that were possible .
only thing i was n't very fond of is the customer service .
only employee that has beard .
his customer service is poor and he is n't very knowledgeable about car audio .
if you 're looking for car audio accessories you 're better off going elsewhere .
it 's been over a week and i still have n't got my computer .
i feel like they do n't care if they actually help me or not .
first rep i asked for help did n't look up from his computer screen .
unfortunately , their service has always been very sub par .
but once you do , they are fairly helpful and knowledgeable .
but just had a poor customer service experience .
it was on sale for $ _num_ which was $ _num_ cheaper than amazon .
unfortunately they were not very helpful .
the sales associates were rather rude .
it was very hard to get service .
they would not stop talking to each other long enough to help me .
sales people are very slow and do n't have much knowledge .
the attitude of customer service is shocking .
but again this could be the reason prices are lower than most places .
1st time there , went to buy a toy helicopter for my child .
not a good 1st time experience .
while some areas have large selections , this place is really falling apart .
half the displays are falling apart and do n't have the sound systems operating .
the aisle with sound bars is a joke .
not particularly helpful unless you know exactly what to ask .
i do n't quite know how they stay in business .
prices are n't usually any better than on line or most big box stores .
the service here is so bad .
it stinks !
unbelievable .
fry 's electronics has so much potential .
it could be my go-to place for what i need .
i do n't understand why this is .
so i bought it for $ _num_ and tried it out at home .
but they do n't know this .
they will not refund me .
i am contacting the manufacturer right now but i do n't have much hope .
awful customer service .
no apology no nothing .
even the cashier has horrible customer service skills .
so frustrating and disappointing .
will not be coming back .
try putting twice the sales people on the floor to help those in need .
would not recommend this place .
this place is beyond horrible .
i will never come back to this pathetic excuse for a store .
my cashier did not smile , barely said hello .
i love frys , but dread coming to this location .
worse experience ever .
will not be visiting fry 's electronics again .
o went for some speakers for my wife 's car and a phone charger .
bad service !
bad layout !
especially when you 're approached by _num_ salespeople during your shopping time .
these guys are ripoff artists .
these guys are ripoff artists .
fry 's management , this situation speaks for itself .
no help to car even though they were supposed to help load it .
got it home , opened the box & tv was clearly used .
had to drive _num_ mins back to store .
no apologies .
staff was rude , unhelpful , and told us lies !
way to go frys ... i will never shop here again !
probably the most unpleasant experience i 've ever had .
once there he asked for the email print out that my order was ready .
he told me no he had to have the email .
why no pick up counter ?
what a complete waste of time and energy .
complete waste of time !
why anyone would ever shop there is beyond me .
the selection was poor !
the merchandise that was in stock was all basic .
bad customer service .
it 's just not funny any more .
so i said `` thank you '' and walked away quickly .
this is not helping .
anyway , fry 's is official off my list .
anyway , just bought it on amazon web site .
amazon will always be your better bet .
i did n't miss it as i the information on the tag .
frys electronics has become such a disappointment when dealing with their extended warranty .
horrible place overall and little to no customer service .
but do n't expect any help from any of the employees .
they just did not want to help assist me .
no i ca n't show you ?
he had no respect .
he had this permanent disgusted look on his face .
no eye contact , no manners at all !
very cold .
very rude .
normally i do n't do subway because there are better choices out there .
said they did n't have any steak .
asked why at that time of day no steak .
stupid look and said he did n't know .
this was quite bad .
better pizza to be found within a _num_ min drive .
she then leaves to go to albertsons .
that 's _num_ minutes on a slow night .
they gave me fettuccine instead of chicken alfredo and hot wings instead of bbq .
my chicken looked like it was boiled .
i will never order from here again , not worth it .
also , they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore !
our favorite has been the pan pizza .
in this case , it was bad .
no buffalo sauce in sight .
not spicy .
my daughter and son who ate the pizza are also sick today .
will not be going back that 's for sure .
management or staff needs to start paying attention .
its giving a bad name for chicago pizza .
dont waste your time or your $ .
here it is $ _num_ .
that being said , this place is very expensive for no reason .
$ _num_ for a _num_ '' pie is a bit ridiculous .
_num_ pm , `` how long for delivery if i order the ribs ? ''
i feel really bad for them .
this was my second visit .
this place is an insult to pizza , restaurants , and chicago .
gave their wings a try , buffalo style .
they only had two to choose from which kind of sucked .
they said they would be crispy but they were very soggy .
they were a descent size and not horribly priced .
the sauce was straight forward hot sauce , nothing special .
this store has no idea what hygiene is or how to run as management .
the manager asked me if i wanted another pizza delivered .
hire a better staff !
the cheese did not taste fresh as well .
the sausage and pepperoni as well as the sauce seemed ok .
sausage on dry bread .
horrible .
i 've learned my lesson , no more rosati 's .
it smelled like fish .
nevertheless , not a fan !
the ranch fries were definitely a large portion as well , but nothing special .
they did not , plus the food itself was not very good !
customer service leaves a bit to be desired .
not very happy with the pharmacy .
dropped off my sick son 's medicine at 3pm .
i 'll try cvs next time .
waiting _num_ days for cough medicine .
by the time it comes in , i will not need it any longer !
there was n't a sign or anything on the computer .
shut your computers down if you are closed !
the guy who was training the new guy gave us a stink eye .
worse customer service ever !
i 'll just drive further to cvs , way nicer .
the service has went down hill for me this past year .
very unhappy .
the service here completely sucks though .
they do n't even acknowledge you half the time .
i told the clerk this before she rang up $ _num_ worth of groceries .
`` express lane '' is a complete joke .
only shop here because it 's close to my home and easy access .
to bad there is n't negative stars .
she does n't know how to treat customers for sure .
she then proceeded to ask someone else to finish checking us in .
i would definitely not recommend this place ever .
i just went in and asked for 1/2 inch off my already short hair .
they sent someone out a week later to give me a bid .
if it was possible to give zero stars i would .
bad communication .
we had nothing but problems .
they damaged our ceiling and said they would repair it .
the damage they caused is over $ _num_ .
acted like the did n't believe me .
all i ordered was _num_ large fries , it took _num_ minutes .
trash everywhere .
tried ordering sundaes also and they had no spoons !
if i could give a _num_ for this mcdonald 's i would .
this seriously is the worst , i mean very worst fast food place ever .
they hire really lame employees and do not properly stock their supplies .
they said , oh , sorry .
if you do n't sell , ice , then why advertise for it ?
-the ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup .
do n't ever visit this location .
how hard is it to get an order correct ... i mean damn .
this is the worst mcdonalds ever .
clearly they are trying to get their drive thru wait times to look fast .
it 's 7pm , it 's not rush hour .
first was bad but decided to try again second mistake .
went back and explained the error acted like no problem .
very poor mcdonald 's overall .
that is not true !
if you are starving , sure , stop here and get something .
soggy fries again !
to make it worse , they kept serving them to other drive-thru customers !
this mcdonald 's is a joke .
the staff are not trained and are basically clueless .
very obvious that this place lacks good management !
i wish that yelp would offer less than _num_ star .
my experience today was by far the worst of any fast food chain ever .
i thought it was _num_ again .
will not let a customer complain and vent .
unfortunately you can not give negative stars .
from the time i ordered till delivery was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
will not let a customer complain and vent .
terrible service .
after waiting way over an hour i called and the manager was rude .
nothing was delivered .
there should be a zero star option .
terrible service .
after waiting way over an hour i called and the manager was rude .
nothing was delivered .
thumbs down !
pizza is good for cheap pizza .
when ordering they do n't advise of specials .
this is not gourmet pizza and charging gourmet prices is unacceptable .
the employees are not helpful or friendly .
wow , never will i order from dominos again .
this location is terrible !
if that were the only issue , i would n't be writing this review .
he said they 'd remake my food , but it would take even longer .
courtesy gets an f rating from me .
do n't go here for your banking .
their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent .
another thing to beware of is fees .
basically , they are charging you $ _num_ per month for a paper statement .
i tried using the service without success and was forced to cancel the transaction .
it just seems greedy to me .
horrible business practices .
all i did was deposit checks and send an electronic mortgage payment each month .
plus i was also getting charged $ _num_ a month for each account .
if you open an account , make sure you know all the fees .
every visit i dread it !
after _num_ days your screwed .
do n't let this happen to you .
amateur hour .
walked in to get info about opening a checking account .
the woman did n't even look up to make eye contact .
what looked great on the pan turned out to be a runny mess .
gross !
it was the worst pizza i have eaten in years .
the service was also awful .
i have given this place a try twice .
not a great place to eat in my opinion just greasy bar food .
they use peanut oil and do n't inform customers .
it is not on their menus or on their website .
and that is the problem .
the portion of chicken this time was not enough for a toddler .
we first went to chase which took all of ten minutes .
they were quite busy , apparently .
to that i received a reply she did not have one .
considering there customer service has not been the most exceptional .
well i would n't charge us to hold on to our money .
id protect me 24/7 is one of them and it is a horrible company .
that was weird .
anyways , they could n't help me .
how disappointing .
it was a waste of a trip , and a waste of my time .
no kidding .
had to drop another star because of how ridiculous this bank is .
but , i should n't be paying for that anyways .
um ... no thanks !
they are the worst credit union in arizona .
they are still the worst probably in the whole us .
will never return or recommend , terrible service .
do your research before you step into this unprofessional and unethical place .
everything they get away with is wrong .
very unappealing first impression of a business !
the waiting line was very long before noon on wednesday as well .
run to a different place unless you have good lube .
you will get screwed .
his employee even apologies to me and said he does it to everyone .
wish i had done more research first .
and the guys in the shop are just as bad .
water in the fuel mean all new fuel lines .
_num_ hours later the ice maker was still not dropping ice .
he was correct , it was not working .
keep in mind , i 'm not trying to get something for free here .
so i guess i 'll just do that .
but that did n't really work out .
i was assigned to appliance repair from my home warranty company .
appliance express is not open on mondays .
service tech was creepy !
* & $ % wtf ?
his dismal attempt at humor did not stop there .
i requested another service tech on the 2nd call .
poor customer service !
phoenix heat is brutal on plastic !
not sure i would want used parts .
if i could give a lower review than one star i would .
this company is rude , unorganized , and unprofessional .
2pm rolls around , they did n't show again !
i check out the ice maker , still broken no ice being made .
no such luck so i call them again .
they tell me they fixed it and billed the manufacturer .
i advised them its not fixed .
i call appliance express and at this point i am extremely upset .
i get a call from scott and set up _num_ hour window .
technician said he would order parts and then would return to repair .
they stated parts did not arrive yet and would check the next day .
each week i called i would get the same 5-7 day message .
they refused .
friendly employee greeted me as i walked in .
the staff here is so rude and quick to judge you .
not to mention the staff looked like they were straight from the ghetto .
can not rate any lower .
rude !
they refuse to remove me from their call list .
they then hung up on me .
i would rate value village at the worst possible company .
i will never , never , ever !
they will not stop .
hated it .
prices are too high , i repeat , too high .
staff was not pleasant to say the least .
will not be back .
they have horrible customer service all of the employees have very bad customer service .
the store is very dirty .
would n't recommend this thrift store .
try another one that has better customer service and prices .
this is the first time in _num_ years i bought an american made car .
i sure wish dealers got a new business model .
why do n't they just shut down for the summer ?
no loan .
the office is open on saturday for pick up , drop off and estimates .
i 'm not an idiot .
so already over $ _num_ .
and figured to get a thorough diagnostic , it would be worth it .
to check those , it would have to go to each department ?
the parking lights wo n't go off .
summary - they nickel and dime you to death if you allow it .
i gave _num_ star because i could n't give _num_ .
if you need any body work , go elsewhere .
still waiting for my car to be fixed correctly almost _num_ months later .
they were amazed that they would n't fix the problem .
no stars !
what the hell , what if i was stranded in this situation ?
i 'm going as far away as i can from you !
do n't waste your time here .
they seem to be a bit slow today .
to bad .
what a crappy way to run a business !
both locations were poor customer service .
while at the northern ave location , they would not take back my exchange .
although they let everyone else know they have a _num_ % satisfaction guarantee .
extremely offended and disappointed .
whenever i go in i always buy over a $ _num_ worth of stuff .
i tried this store for the first time and it was horrible .
they ignored the shit out of me the entire time .
worst one i 've ever been to !
super disappointed in the service today .
they had a sale buy _num_ get _num_ free .
what a waste of time and energy .
not _num_ minutes after that time .
if i could give negative stars i would !
bought a shirt at register _num_ in the sport clothes section of the store .
we called them and they could have cared less about their error .
horrible service !
everyone there had a horrible attitude , customers are not a priority .
please do n't go you will regret .
pretty annoying actually .
seriously ... that is a bit much for the crap you are selling .
plus the quality of jewelry is crap .
so i said excuse me can i come back and get my order ?
i will never go back and i warn others not to either .
so , they 're trying to make it up to me .
i did not receive the $ _num_ credit as promised .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
it smells like death .
the employees are rude .
there hours are inconsistent .
this is _num_ .
this is _num_ .
dont waste your time or energy waiting in line at this dump .
this place sucks .
i came here once and never returned cheap people drive me nuts .
i paid with a debit card and was still treated rudely !
your sandwiches are not that great !
bad day ?
my appointment was scheduled with peter .
appointment day and time came , no peter , no call .
once again , no call , no peter .
horrible customer service from the operations manager and up .
i paid my bill in full and will never do business with them again .
no stars for the service , the food prices and soda refill charge .
servers are not knowledgeable about menu items and food .
i ordered menudo with corn tortilla , they did n't have them either .
no toilet paper in bathroom only hand towels .
no fatty chunks or bones .
other places give u tons of onion n few cilantro leaves .
terrible service .
no returns , even less than an hour later .
over dinner a few minutes later i looked at my receipt noticed no sale .
staff not friendly i felt like i was being followed around the whole time .
terrible customer service and poor food quality .
will never go back as i would not recommend it .
terrible , greasy food .
it 's offensive to call this chinese food .
the only good thing i can say is it 's cheap and fast .
this location is just below standards .
employees really hate their jobs and people .
almost like they do it on purpose because you ordered online .
i would skip this panda and go elsewhere .
this is the worst panda ever .
slow service !
every time i go to this location it 's slow !
he told me that it would cost $ _num_ for all this work .
i am lost as a customer .
( no , he does n't ) .
is n't he dead ?
( no , very much alive ) .
dave ruins his reputation allowing someone in his shop who does this .
i do n't know why this place has such high reviews ?
which is sad being a new age store , i expect good energy .
horrible !
it was weird .
not worth the $ _num_ ... not worth $ _num_ .
others may be good ... this dude , no !
apparently they hire a company to come tow people every night .
should n't they already know if someone parks in their lot ?
horrible experience .
staff is not very knowledgeable .
well , my last review was _num_ stars .
do n't say i did n't warn you .
it 's bad business and bad customer service .
possibly the worst customer service i 've ever experienced in the valley .
never again will they get my dollars .
either way you 'd get better service at wal-mart than at dee 's .
sales people are snobby and act like you know nothing about dance .
i despise going here to get dance gear .
freezer burn maybe ?
not sure but did n't seem totally fresh .
they did not really fix my problem .
where do i start with this place ?
back in january i needed to have my yearly exam and order new contacts .
two weeks later and no call , i finally called them back .
i went back for another paid follow up visit .
this time she supposedly ordered me different contacts .
i scheduled another follow up exam and tried to explain the problems again .
i tried calling back to see about getting another brand of trails .
the gentleman on the phone told me he would call me back .
of course he did n't call me back .
i will never use sears optical again .
the customer service is just flat out rude .
do n't expect a phone call back .
they also do n't care about their customers .
even the doctor does n't care .
i would never wish these problems on anyone else !
this has been one expensive nightmare !
the delivery people said they would return in an hour to install .
bottom line , worst experience of my life with sears !
they also said once they got off the call they would call me back .
the worst customer service ever .
needless to say i will never purchase anything from sears ever again .
_num_ months more than my other transmission shop .
it was not that often so i did n't think much of it .
( my biggest mistake ) .
he made sure to point that out as soon as i got there .
if i could go back this is what i would do .
and that 's too bad because the best advertisement is word of mouth .
my experience here was dreadful .
it looked like a dump .
i hate these big pharmacy chains !
too bad this person does n't listen !
she only gave me two options for the actual cake .
every single one of them was stale , barely edible .
i can not believe i wasted my time and money .
it was stale .
i could n't believe they could go stale .
that place seems to be so busy .
i took a bite and it was no good .
they are old and rude .
he kept making jokes and laughing .
ill never go back there again .
the polish ended up being a rough texture and very dull in appearance .
i returned to the shop within two days and explained my concern .
this place is a rip off !
but again they were the experts , so i trusted them .
also , they seemed to have thrown my parts out by accident .
its now fixed and only cost $ _num_ .
their meat is really overpriced over other places .
it tasted more boiled than anything .
no grill flavor .
just horrible place .
trust me you will not be disappointed .
i know it was not my hair because the sandwich was wrapped up .
the chicken does n't look like it was cooked all the way .
i do not want them to spit in my food .
such a waste of money .
gross and cold anytime i 've ever went .
it 's really a shame how bad this location is .
i do n't want to be the next case of food poisoning .
terrible .
results were poor .
worse part was , it was a ten dollar haircut .
i gave her a _num_ .
before getting my change , i handed her two dollars for tip .
when i counted my change , i received _num_ dollars back instead of _num_ .
seriously ?
the pork was tough , dry , and flavorless .
the guacamole was really runny and flavorless .
the horchata taste like the cheap kind with a gritty texture .
bland salsa .
bland service .
do n't get me started on the chips with sour cream and guacamole .
it seems like they do n't use fresh produce at all .
went through the drive thru for just dessert and waited _num_ minutes .
this place is crap !
horrible .
i also went to use the restroom and neither stall had toilet paper .
terrible customer service .
grabbed the family food , waited _num_ minutes in drive thru .
many items lacked price tags .
it was too much !
gross .
this is where old clothes go to die .
which would have been a lot more satisfying to both me and my wallet .
the lobby and dining room are the same space .
it was n't like there was any seating .
we tried to support downtown and felt bad that we were denied .
they are open late and down there and have never let me down .
horrible service !
horrible service and the hand wash is worthless .
_num_ regular car washes pass before they even got to my car .
worst car wash experience ever .
bell road has the worst customer service ever .
do not recommend .
why the heck would i want to get out of my car too early .
no one even acknowledged me so i asked .
no big deal just annoying .
so no one tells you they just expect you to know .
also i feel pretty sad for those that work there .
i heard someone yelling at employees and yelling about employees .
not the kind of entertainment i was wanting .
i 'm very dissapointed and will never return to this location !
worst car wash that i have ever had .
i will not be returning .
why would i pay for wheels to get cleaned and they 're not ?
horrible - i paid to have my interior vacuumed and wiped down .
they charge a pretty hefty fee for sub par work .
guess i 'll be looking for a different place to get my car washed !
one of these days i 'll remember that they are terrible and stop going .
all if it was in plain view .
that 2nd guy is the only reason this is a _num_ star review .
this place has gone downhill fast .
he told me oh less than an hour you 're the first one in .
i went inside and sat down to wait .
no thank you .
well i was wrong .
then was told he 's with a customer and would call me back .
this past week was my last time taking my car here .
sad that i have to find another place after so many years .
took an hour to get my car washed .
they tried to break into my car when they locked the keys in .
like that is an excuse .
then i had to wait for a different manager to help me .
i use to have faith in this place but no longer .
horrible job , long waits .
waited an hour to get my car cleaned .
if i could give no stars i would .
i call manager , i called police .
worst ever and now i am done for ever with danny 's .
my car sits while _num_ others behind me get wiped down .
are you kidding me ?
and btw , they never cleaned the inside .
i just gave them a second try ... not sure why .
on top of that they did a crappy job .
expensive , slow , and terrible !
nasty !
i would not take a car here , nor will i ever return .
they did n't vacuum it nor did they spray the scent inside .
the attendants do a poor job on the interior and windows .
you lost a customer that has been going there for the last _num_ years !
do n't get kids meal with chicken nuggets !
gross !
this place was a disappointment .
they have only _num_ gyro on the menu .
c'mon now , every greek restaurant should have more than _num_ type of gyro .
they also did n't have the beef sandwich .
the rest of the food was fair to poor .
i ca n't stand banking here .
just do n't bank here .
the worst banking center ever .
one teller , only one .
i said no , i wanted what i asked for .
_num_ minutes going early in the morning .
perfect combo to go along with the stale chips .
very difficult to believe that anybody would find anything tasteful in this restaurant .
tables that came after were served before us .
but we also got _num_ combo plates and neither of them were very good .
really nothing special or good .
too bad ... .
this lenny 's location is horrible .
the fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old .
they were horrible .
will never eat at _num_ w. glendale location again .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
they did n't even get order correct to begin with .
the bathroom had a weird hall tree straight out of a bad cowboy movie .
this review is as of october _num_ , _num_ .
the food came out promptly and i immediately dug into my fries .
they were hot but very limp .
i ended up switching sodas and that did n't fare any better .
i got the double patty burger , which are still sadly , very thin .
the meat itself had no flavor .
the thousand island dressing on the burgers was very thin and runny .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the burger was bland overall .
there was no hint of pink on the patties .
that 's a no .
pickles feel plastic .
not good at all !
i 'm not exaggerating .
the toilet looked as if never cleaned .
fries are tasteless , greasy and i suspect cooked in old oil .
first of all , the burgers themselves are pretty lame .
way too salty .
terrible .
not to mention the man taking my order had a coke nail .
i could n't eat them .
the burger was ok , but poor quality beef .
also could not finish that .
disgusting !
in chicago , the crust is crunchy and flaky .
in chicago , the sauce tastes like they just mashed up some fresh tomatoes .
then to top off the crappy food was the staff .
until things change , i wo n't be wasting any more money here .
the pizza is not awful .
it is pizza and when is pizza ever bad ?
however , it is nothing special and definitely below average .
crust is awesome , homemade sausage is fabulous !
horrible in attentive staff .
unfortunately the service was so disappointing that i will not return .
was n't impressed at all .
chicago style pizza was burnt and wings where not even crispy .
when i got there they rang up the bill and said $ _num_ .
i am from chicago and miss the pizza very much .
could not even taste it do to the poor hours .
went there late night last weekend as not many options were there .
as per me i did not like the pizza taste at all .
may be not according to my liking .
vito 's gets the thumbs down , we will not order again .
all spice , no interest .
their tomato sauce also is flavorless .
overall very boring pizza experience ; in a word , disappointing .
even the national chains do it better .
i 'm annoyed that i spent good money on this pizza .
apparently i much prefer ny style pizza , not chicago .
i miss the pizza from my old hood ( aiello 's ) .
apparently , it is closed !
there is no way to get any food .
so , i would skip this one .
this is n't even where i started out to go for lunch today .
i was driving down the road and it caught my eye .
i had a breast with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw .
i will not shop at one of my favorite stores again .
such a bad experience .
i will not come here again .
ca n't get this place to call me back that 's holding my car .
i would highly recommend not using this place .
same guy working there , and he was just a complete jerk .
no free samples just a decades old video going .
no employee greeted me or even noticed i was there .
big waste of time !
we did the tour through the factory and it was nothing special .
but being a customer i feel that it was poor service .
okay very old inside and out even smells old inside .
nothing to ever come back again to .
last year it arrived january _num_ .
really awful .
that 's _num_ of us though .
no stars !
this is the worst bingo i 've ever gone to !
i tried calling _num_ times with no answer .
overall , not worth it for the money .
i am highly disappointed .
i got a confirmation email etc .
ummm no !
i was told they had tried to deliver and there was no answer .
was very disappointed and will not order again unfortunately .
this place has been a terrible experience throughout .
the apartment itself looks to have had its door kicked in before .
this is the ghetto , move here at own risk !
dont come here !
i stopped by to pick up some mexican sweet bread this past sunday .
worst mistake .
rings me up tells me the total is $ _num_ and some change .
worst customer service .
save your money and go somewhere else or they will rip you off !
this is ridiculous !
no parmesan cheese and not even an apology !
we got the worst delivery driver ever .
i 've been craving this place since then .
store is a mess .
the fountain drink had been down for _num_ days .
it seems that corporate does not care .
unfortunately , my husband and i had a terrible experience at this uniform place .
she did not reach me until the following wednesday .
was then told they would courier to my work the next day .
they did not , no communication whatsoever .
a complete waste of time .
they were n't out , they do n't carry them .
the regulars were quite creepy and rude .
it was odd and very uncomfortable .
other men pointed and made rude comments .
the bartender was nice , but the other women were not .
i wo n't be back .
basic as fuck , i want no part of it .
the coke was flat .
also , nothing even close to what was on the website .
sandy , was very apologetic and i requested to make the transaction right .
requested a refund which sandy , agreed .
owner christine never called me to take care of it .
i requested an all pink , as her favorite color is pink .
while she was very appreciative , we are n't happy with what was delivered .
just very dissatisfied with what we paid for and what was sent .
we did not have such a great experience .
kinda funny , kinda not .
hubs ordered some type of sandwich which he was immediately pissed off about .
the salad was very small and very old looking , wilted lettuce .
these guys were horrible !
no customer service .
no sense of urgency .
am yet to get a call back .
on top of never getting status updates about what was going on .
i guess they did have a lot of good ash trays .
as brake shops go there are no worse than most .
so why only two stars ?
i made my appointment and was told _num_ min on the phone .
strike _num_ .
i was originally told i only needed the $ _num_ alignment .
when i questioned them on the price they quickly changed it to $ _num_ .
too quickly .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
the place is busy .
will not be back .
too many other places in phoenix .
this is the worst apartment complex i have ever experienced .
staff does nothing .
she avoided me like the plague .
the place was disgusting and completely filthy .
no wonder i had roaches !
do n't even consider this place !
the end result is functional doggie door on a messy wall .
they should know better .
thanks for nothing mike .
- $ _num_ for a used dresser ?
i would fire all employees and hire honest friendly ones .
this place should be shut down for good .
the staff was very rude before and after that .
so disappointed !
the man behind the counter watched tv and spoke to no one !
used , torn furniture for $ _num_ !
looking back , the experience was a nightmare .
they said it was his off day .
this is ridiculous .
i would never go there again .
they wasted my money , and wasted my time .
one woman in particular kept ignoring me when i was complaining .
some of the food was from costco ( confirmed by our waitress ) .
my sister and daughter thought the chicken salad made them a little sick .
do n't waste your time or money .
i walked in an hour early to set up .
still we had _num_ for lunch .
that was never mentioned before .
there was also a $ _num_ charge for room rental .
and she replied `` no , i do n't !
i tried to reason with her but she kept arguing and was very nasty .
she even insulted my two remaining guests by telling them how messy they were .
ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early january .
another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month .
you need to call at least _num_ hours in advance to make the reservation .
the coupon price does not include tax and gratuity .
too bad !
they then direct you to another restroom away from diners .
i wish i had taken a picture of the sign .
like i said , not worth the regular price of $ _num_ .
there was no nut free alternative .
my client had no clue of my allergy and could not have known .
avoid !
i do n't really understand how this happened .
i also do n't think that it would be worth it at full price .
boy what a mistake it was buying this deal !
not me !
ha ha would not recommend this place to anyone !
i had to wait about _num_ minutes before anyone even came by .
then we continued to wait some more .
by this time i was feeling really sick and needed something in my stomach .
we sat for another _num_ mins without any service , not even tea .
the service and management is just terrible .
this place is a disaster as a tea house .
we had to wait to be seated , even thought we had a reservation .
more rudeness , more waiting , mediocre food .
skip this place .
there are far too many horror stories to waste your money here .
all in all , it left a bad taste in our mouth !
avoid this place !
tea was a little disappointing .
people are rude on the phone and in person !
this was by far the worst place to go !
she just did not want to accommodate us !
we were extremely offended and upset so we walked out of this joint .
do yourself a favor and skip this place !
do n't walk - run from this place !
it was supposed to be special - but it was a disaster .
yes , i am serious .
so you get dry sandwiches and cold scones .
no food in any restaurant tastes good with bad customer service .
do n't even waste your time .
a horrible time was had by all in our party .
no complaints there .
i about fell off my chair , so did my mom .
i 'm surprised this place still sticks around , what a disgrace .
also , there 's no substitutions of food .
i do not recommend this place , due to the customer service .
it was not a pleasant experience .
and no , it is not an exaggeration .
not very impressed at all , the food was stale .
the soup came out and it was very nasty .
worst customer service !
_num_ of us girls went , i originally made reservations for _num_ .
the next day i called back to cancel my original reservation and number count .
the lady i spoke to was super rude !
rude !
that was uncomfortable because the girls were wondering what was going on .
i will not return and hope you take this into consideration .
so disappointing that they would n't accomodate .
this is the worst machine shop to go to .
where does the staff go , and wash their hands ?
no clue !
my chili cheese dog craving was needing to be filled .
this place is a joke !
i smiled and said yes .
i said no i had a tea in the car .
i said no , i will be eating here .
she said i do n't let people eat here unless they spend _num_ .
they were tasteless .
we took a few bites threw it away and walked out .
i ca n't believe how we were treated and served .
i felt uncomfortable in the dining area and there was a strange smell .
the ladies were allowed to be left alone to do their cleaning .
jay and his ladies told me they knew nothing about it .
this was my first time using mm and i will never use them again .
such a rip off !
to make matters worse , their customer service is awful .
i was lied to and ripped off and really caution against using this company .
thats not good .
this was just the closest place to my house .
the price was reasonable so we placed an order for all windows measured .
so strange that a business owner would blow off a large job like this .
the chicken was not only cold in the middle and burn on the outside .
i 'm not just saying that it was dry chicken .
worst ever !
negative _num_ stars !
the fact that it was empty should have told me something .
the salad was not exactly fresh , the dressing tasted funny .
god knows how long it was in that warmer ... .
there was a line out of the door for pizza when i arrived .
so , i stood in line for a very long time .
so , i asked , `` which flavors are available tonight ? ''
she said : `` we just have pepperoni tonight . ''
had a really poor experience here .
the place is very old and that makes it look very dirty .
the bathroom was so disgusting that i walked back out .
the pizza was missing some toppings too .
we have n't gone back and probably never will .
they even had butt stains on the cushions .
gross !
_num_ weeks later ... .
chairs came ... and they 're the wrong color .
okay , now i 'm definitely not paying the difference for the chairs .
fortunately , they did n't argue price .
i have never been so horrified in my entire life .
scary place .
you are greeted by a giant stuffed bear in a glass case .
no calls to apologize for change of delivery date .
we have not had a great experience with lee 's quality counter tops .
the service was not friendly but fairly quick .
i would rather take my wife and kids to taco bell after tonight .
it 's also not as clean as it used to be .
first this place is not cheep .
food was n't good and way !
a few weekends ago , i went in to sell some old jewelry .
one register already had a customer and no one was at the other one .
i told her that she must be mistaken , but she insisted .
do not deal with arnold .
he was very rude right from the beginning .
the green tamale were ok but the sauce was blah .
one of the server look like she hated her job she never smile .
it would have been nice to felt welcome not like a bother .
not a good place to take young kids .
my beer mug was dirty , and i never notice things like that .
service was slow and not the friendliest .
no music was playing .
food was average mexican food- i tried tacos , enchiladas , beans , rice .
prices were very reasonable .
maybe it was a bad day for them .
service was typical .
the beans and rice were nothing special .
chips , salsa and water were served .
the booths are small and cramped and the food is nothing special !
hey , i may have been on an off day ... twice .
both times the food was mediocre at best .
service flat out sucked !
when we finally got our food it was undercooked and cold .
nasty , overpriced , bland food .
dont understand how people make lines and wait for this place .
they obviously do n't know any better .
mediocre food even worse service .
also they do not serve horchata !
the waitresses ignore you and avoid you until tip time .
did not have a good experience .
ate here for the first time with my girlfriend .
food was mediocre at best , service was subpar .
me of why i disliked chicken in the past .
it surely did n't taste like chicken .
the rice was tasteless till i poured the salsa over it .
the refried beans is typical refried beans out of a can .
i mean , they were my guests .
plus , they are from a city that does n't do mexican food well .
not all that .
not so happy cashier lady .
but i am expecting flavor with a little kick .
not friendly but not rude either .
the cheese inside was not soft and melted as it once was .
my daughter ordered the cheese enchilada last week and was of the same opinion .
the customer service has gone down as well as the food quality .
please pedro 's get it together you were my all time favorite place .
there is only one old guy who actually knows what he 's talking about .
the rest are idiots .
the prices are ridiculous .
i will never be going back .
i just do n't see the big deal with this place .
yes , there is alot of sports memorabilia , mostly college .
the bar itself feels dirty to me .
it 's dark and no frills at all .
the tables and chairs are below average or average at best .
they have _num_ large tvs that are kind of dark .
i do n't like that they charge you to sit in that room .
the beer was cheaper .
also , if you have a large group , i would recommend somewhere else .
the bartenders seemed bored , no real energy in the place .
can i give a no star rating ?
but , no more .
so it 's too bad they wo n't be on that list .
as it turns out it was a total disappointment .
the bar tender is rude and not very accommodating to customer needs .
he came back slammed the drink on the table and walked away .
it was still horrible .
when we took a bite it was way to dry and tasted rather stale .
i guess it was n't the best or the worst iv had .
honestly i would n't waist my time or money on this place .
i 've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me .
the fish was n't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse !
there is not a lot of parking for a bar this big inside .
there are tv 's everywhere but they are n't very big tv 's .
the fries were the only good thing about both sandwiches .
my philly was literally the worst i have ever had .
he is used to club sandwiches stacked with meat .
my husband 's bud light in a bottle was $ _num_ .
it is so dated !
he has the new id so i do n't know what the problem was .
we really did not care for the atmosphere .
wo n't be going back .
horrible food !
grade school cafeteria was not what i expected .
the management not so good .
the exterior is tired and the inside needs updated .
he fired christine , who has been there _num_ years .
no stars !
five negative stars are n't even enough .
my advice : do n't go there unless you like creepy men .
not even creepy old men .
i do not and will never set foot in there .
i warned you .
egg roll i think not grease stick !
sadly our food was n't very good .
worst service ever .
bunch of idiots .
personally she should have just let the answering machine pick up .
so king wah closed for like a month back in october .
we are sad , this was our go to chinese delivery .
no flavor .
hits and misses .
some dishes perfect , others too salty , too bland , etc .
you do n't need to have every possible dish on the menu .
_num_ cents more and not even a sorry .
sigh , we 're regulars too .
we ordered dinner combos with orange chicken and kung pao chicken .
we were extremely disappointed .
not only was the food made of low quality it had horrible flavor .
this is by far one of the worst chinese food places we have tried .
they seemed very put out we were trying to place a to go order .
the place was empty so there should not be rushed .
she just said he said no .
not impressed at all .
egg drop soup was plain , no veggies , tofu etc .
ordered the mongolian chicken - way too salty and oily .
cashew chicken , same thing .
worst chinese food i ever had .
i was so disappointed .
it would n't surprise me that the business is going to be closed soon .
being a chinese does n't mean you know how to cook chinese food .
you need to be a chef to run a restaurant .
my usual chinese spot was closed so we ventured here .
i thought it was just one dish but no , it was everything .
work was performed at the surprise location .
the bill was about $ _num_ .
bad customer service .
and , wow , what a miss .
secondly , they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar .
how on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce ?
skip the fish , it 's awful .
because pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet !
wrong .
which by the way did not have its price listed .
wrong again $ _num_ !
ugh i had to spit it out .
i did n't care for the red sauce on my fish .
the worst fish and chips i have ever had .
i ca n't believe people think this is good .
overpriced processed food and unfriendly service .
sucks that i had to give such a low rating !
now originally i was born in glendale , but was raised in long beach !
glad i set my expectations low .
pete 's fish is ok , square , almost like processed but not .
the onion rings were good ( super greasy though ) .
they may be trying to do too many things at once here .
i would not go out of my way to eat at pete 's again .
what the hell is that .
the fries were questionable .
this place serves nothing but frozen seafood .
nothing had any flavor at all .
very bland .
not worth the trip .
why are people lining up for disgusting frozen fish ?
no hot sauce !
shrimp was _num_ % batter .
instead of fish , fish patties .
this is n't what i had in london .
the shrimp were n't good either ; tasted extremely fishy .
the fries were soggy and bland .
the sandwich was very crunchy and the nuggets were nothing special .
they were very thin and mostly crust .
when tasting without the sauce they were bland .
no one cleaning tables during the time i was there .
_num_ oz .
_num_ oz .
_num_ oz .
we use to go to pete 's all the time back in the day .
just nasty is all i can really say .
i had the _num_ piece fish and _num_ piece shrimp .
the best way to sum this up is frozen overly processed fish .
frozen processed fish patties are not fish and chips .
this is _num_ .
first sign of i should have left was no credit card machine .
all in all very shady charges for a meal not very good .
flat pop ?
the banquet would probably be better .
my first clue was when i was told there was no malt vinegar .
i was disappointed with everything i ordered .
extremely disappointed .
if you are from the coast , do n't waste your money !
for a quarter you could get two fish sandwiches .
i remember the patties being thicker with more fish and less breading .
this being said this store has taking an all time low .
what 's with the little flat over cooked dry shrimp nuggets , terrible .
maybe a little salt to bring out the flavors will help .
the fish patty was not very good .
although the shrimp was pretty good , nothing else i had was .
i wo n't bother going back .
they 'll taste better than pete 's fishy patty .
never again ... so so so disappointed !
if your looking for cheep this is your place .
just .
the worst fish and chips i every had .
the fries , onion rings , fish where just gross .
over fried and no taste .
fries were mediocre , too .
paper basket full of processed fried food is a better description .
waste of time and money .
# _num_ . )
they have atm machines outside _num_ of their _num_ locations .
why people prefer to waste money here is beyond me .
the piece of fish tastes like paper card board .
the fries , blah soggy and sometimes cold .
it all lacks flavors .
no salt in anything !
it 's not the same pete 's fish and chips i grew up on .
crispy , but completely boring .
frozen standard boring fries .
disappointed i ate them anyways .
soon , i got used them and continued to go to pete 's .
i never turn down free food usually !
_num_ stars for the food being hot and convenient .
it is _num_ !
i am normally not carrying cash on me .
it 's really not that hard to do separate checks .
i always get the chicken tenders and fries .
i can get better fish and chips in the frozen food section at walmart .
it 's all over battered frozen crap that grocery stores sell .
and is n't good at all .
basically it 's wan na be cocktail sauce .
worst fish and chips place ever .
with no real lemon , only lemon juice packets .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
disgusting .
what happen ?
they do live music here , and my band was scheduled to play recently .
ca n't imagine how a dump like that even pays for shoes .
so we politely declined to stay and do something illegal , and left .
i went through the drive through , and was greeted with only silence .
this certainly was not .
every other bite greeted me with either gristle or chunks of fat .
terrible service , terrible food .
there is very little parking for the bowling alley .
it 's fairly dim inside .
lane _num_ is n't very reliable .
i would avoid that lane if possible .
we gave him trash just to get him to go away for a while .
maybe they got confused and thought is was an ice hockey tournament .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
place is dirty smells staff are rude .
placed a phone order walked in and was shocked by how it looked inside .
i hung up and they called back i refused to answer the phone .
this place is dirty and the staff needs training on customer service .
now i see why i hate coming here .
disgusting !
horrible sewer smell as soon as you enter the restaurant .
cardboard !
ok normally this place is on point for me .
it was so bitter and nasty .
what a piece of crap .
the crab puffs were good , but did n't have any crab in them .
for a quick meal on the cheap this place is n't that bad .
however , it was n't very good either .
app and see where it led me .
now do n't get me wrong .
we had not eaten here for a number of months .
we also got the hot and sour soup and it also lacked flavor .
they do not worry about getting to your apartment to fix it in time .
does n't really matter if you are on the 3rd floor or not .
[ clearly understaffed ] ) pet deposit is $ _num_ .
ridiculous , but most places have a ridiculous pet policy .
they did not clean it , i did .
horrible place to live .
staff was inconsiderate except the older more experienced lady , she was great .
it took almost a week and three service requests for maintenance to fix it .
they did n't paint it until shortly before i returned the second day .
i can not wait till my lease is up .
first off , we 've never been to such place .
the apartment smells like sewer from the kitchen sink and dishwasher .
our patio door lock is broken , anyone can come and break in .
this is a horrible place to live .
im tired of killing roaches every night before i have to go to bed .
guess they cant even call and tell someone it opened up and closed .
sorry we do n't have anything availability for walk throw .
very bad customer service.
ross and i enter `` kiss the cook '' .
the top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm .
i did n't want to make her feel badly .
the manager ( maybe the owner ?
save your money and avoid this place .
it just is n't sanitary .
staff here seem friendly and busy , but efficient .
i went w/ a belgian waffle , two eggs , and bacon .
next time we 'll try the pancakes and crepes !
i 'm not really a fan .
i would have given a _num_ star but used the bathroom before leaving .
well , i went into the bathroom anyways ... did n't use it .
totally disgusting and i have a feeling the kitchen is n't much better .
the coffee is so weak any flavor you get is from the added cream .
the eggs benedict was over cooked to the point where the yellow solid .
the place was very crowded but server was friendly .
the food came out _num_ minutes apart with the benedict first .
pumpkin pancakes had too much cinnamon .
i do n't like this false advertising of menu items .
but the food is nothing special .
it went downhill after that .
the eggs were cooked nicely but the cajun sauce just did n't taste right .
this one missed the spot .
not impressed - food was flavorless .
wait staff looked run down but were nice .
my corn beef hash was mushy with uncooked veggies .
the basket of muffins was okay but dry .
even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon .
went last weekend , got two eggs and bacon with potatoes .
the eggs were cooked well but flavorless ... the whole plate was flavorless .
on top of that , we waited over _num_ minutes for a table .
no booths in case u wanted _num_ know .
was n't happy .
my fiance got the corn beef hash , thumbs down .
it was burnt yet soggy in the inside .
overall not happy .
the cook probably had a rough morning .
and then i couldnt get waited on .
three waitresses walked by but still no service .
the parking spaces were limited .
a long line was already out the door waiting for a table .
why are brunch places always so busy ?
the biscuits & gravy did n't taste fresh and homemade .
they were tasteless and hard .
i would return just to order the basket of muffins .
like the massive three egg omelet but not happy with the ingredients used .
service is ok , prices are fair .
poor service and food was mediocre at best .
it took _num_ minutes before someone took our drink order .
i guess they just did n't want to make them over medium .
i will never go back to this place again .
this is possibly the most adorable looking restaurant in glendale .
my cajun chicken caesar salad arrives .
it might be the teriyaki flavor topped with too much salt .
this made the potatoes very dry like chalk .
sadly i have to kiss this place good bye !
then she answered a call and took an order and then just walked away .
unacceptable .
although the place is cute , i could n't even finish eating my food .
overall not a good tasting meal .
horrible customer service .
our food was blah , as was the coffee .
she had the nerve to remove _num_ cents from the bill .
this was the most insulting dining experience of my life .
i would n't recommend this to anyone under the age of _num_ .
would not recommend .
the staff is nice , but slow .
nothing bad , nothing good .
the food is bland and basic .
she told me no .
a rip off of $ _num_ .
day _num_ , repeat emergency visit , more work on `` root canal . ''
also note , this is not a gentle dentist by any means .
very painful .
the temporary was too large for my mouth .
you could tell they did n't like that i was having concerns .
i will be contacting the dental board to report this issue .
i saw another dentist yesterday wednesday morning and felt better already by the afternoon .
this place chicken sucks .
all there food sucks .
grossly disappointed !
i had a hard time giving this place even two stars .
it was very thin , and a light brown .
the chicken was on the bone , and the fatty skin was still on .
the one , somewhat redeeming factor of my meal was the tortilla .
it was pretty good , but still a little dry .
most closely related to dog food .
shit , i do n't think i would even feed it to my dog .
overall , this was a disappointing experience .
its too bad lily 's closed down .
the 2nd red is a chunky salsa where all you can taste is garlic .
the problem is the little weird things they do to their food and sauces .
very , very disappointing coming from a real food landmark !
we miss the hell outta you .
wish i had n't .
pedro 's down the street on glendale is n't too shabby .
the real problem i had with the restaurant had to do with its cleanliness .
rude waitress .
the beans were very runny and the rice did n't have much flavor .
he also did n't like the beans .
the food was n't horrible but was n't good either .
service from this point was very slow .
took a good _num_ minutes to get our food .
will certainly not go out of my way to return .
it was tired , but clean inside .
i ordered checked fajitas , but was told later they were out of chicken .
the margarita was weak .
the food was terrible .
the service was terrible .
the bus girl gave us better service than our server .
first timer , was n't what i expected .
our chips & water guy was way more attentive then amy .
after _num_ minutes of total waiting we finally got our food , cold .
we questioned the server and she put blame on lack of chefs in kitchen .
the people were all very nice but the food was bland & not good .
i will never come back to this place again .
we went there new years day for some menudo , cheese crisp .
maybe it was a bad day ?
my families experience here tonight was an absolute nightmare !
the staff was no where to be found .
obviously , i was done eating for the evening .
i had no interest in ordering something new with less hair .
the bill that was hand written , chicken scratch that we could barely read .
i 'm sure i 've been eating that this place since before birth .
the order took _num_ hour _num_ minutes to get to us .
this was a waist of _num_ hours of my sunday .
yuck , do not go here !
can i give zero no i wish .
we walked in at _num_ pm no one there to greet us .
the mole looked and tasted more like super salty gravy .
no one greeted us when we walked in .
sour tasting tamales .
do n't be fooled .
it 's really that bad !
found an entrance , walked in and was greeted by no one .
the female quickly sent hers back as there was something wrong with the taco .
mexican restaurant no longer giving complimentary chips and salsa ?
did n't even bother ordering .
the chimi was not prepared as i remembered .
i feel so bad that my elderly mother tried to eat it .
no apologies .
go to pedro '' s _num_ miles east on glendale .
but recently it 's taken a turn for the much much worse .
the food has been very bland and burnt just very ordinary .
the service has been terrible and they do n't clean anymore .
the rest room smells so bad like urine about made me want to gag .
the food was mediocre at best .
we ordered a small cheese crisp which was not fully cooked .
the green chili burro was ordinary .
i did n't check the restrooms .
the server was very , very rude .
when my food finally came out , the potatoes were greasy and undercooked .
the bacon was the most over-cooked bacon i have ever seen .
this place does n't even deserve one star .
or even , taco bell would be better !
do n't bother going .
could n't even get a manager to talk to !
not real mexican food !
the meat on the tacos is the same ground beef .
not even asada nor real cheese .
just taste so fake .
so gross !
today was absurd .
even got the hot sauce wrong .
i know it 's not a huge deal .
this location is the worst !
it was fucking nasty .
i got my burrito made wrong .
with the wrong sauce .
they dont even deserve one star .
sadly i was disappointed .
this location is terrible .
my did not receive items that i was charged for .
the staff was unprofessional , especially the manager on duty .
_num_ they forget items , screw up the order .
all items are n't listed on the drive thru menu .
but this place needs work ... same shit every time i go here .
_num_ minute wait in drive thru , lunch break over .
thank you , yes i was late getting back to work .
it is a joke , the staff sucks .
ok so i called them last week on wednesday december _num_ , _num_ .
so i go to pay and he says it is _num_ dollars .
only kids working in the office now and not very professional .
( all emails are supposedly answered within _num_ hours . )
coffee cup never empty .
it 's really hard to ruin breakfast .
probably one of the worst breakfasts i 've had in my whole life .
the potatoes are tasteless .
in my head , the record skipped once i saw the food .
i do n't like diner food that refuses to try .
however the food delivered to the table had much to be desired .
of the three meals ordered none were finished .
our juices were delivered within a minute or _num_ of ordering .
i usually eat breakfast at home .
probably the most pathetic example of `` customer service '' i have ever encountered .
another week or so goes by and i call again .
idiots !
`` oh , its not under warranty . ''
never again and yelpers , you have been warned !
no bueno !
great for a quick stop for a forgotten item on vacation .
we ended up going to sprouts down the street and were much happier .
always takes way too long to check out .
never enough cashiers to just grab an item or two .
drives me bananas !
slow service , rude employees .
employees have work there a long time ( maybe too long ) .
they do n't seem to like their jobs .
_num_ & 1/2 later and they still are n't here !
we called _num_ mins ago to check and they had every excuse .
absolutely terrible company to have to deal with .
waited three and a half hours for a tow that never showed up .
then sent the tow truck to the wrong place twice .
if you need a tow , take your chance with someone else .
_num_ minutes go by , no text or call .
no contact period , from anyone .
you guessed it , _num_ minutes ... .
absolutely the worst company !
after more than an hour passed , i called to check in .
my recommendation is to use anyone except sun city .
i left a voicemail but no call back .
screw you sun city towing !
i disagree with the review above .
the woman i spoke with said everything was good to go .
they did n't even have my order .
i have never been treated this poorly in my entire life !
terrible service .
i went to the counter and _num_ people just kept working .
the did n't have the plate i needed and they did not care .
received the same terrible service on two occasions .
this place was terrible .
like , clearly , it 's unacceptable .
very sloppy work .
i 'm out $ _num_ and i have no gift .
as a side note , it is a ripoff price .
that 's too much money anyway .
terrible experience .
wo n't be back .
these people are not honest in their profession .
my last visit was july _num_ .
definitely the worst one ever .
i could n't say enough good things .
i 've never had problems like that .
oh hmm no u can wait a little longer .
oh no they are bad u better come in soon like _num_ weeks .
are u kidding me ?
i will tell everyone avoid this place at all costs !
it 's the worst !
very disappointed with this dental office .
$ _num_ for _num_ of us with coupon for _num_ minutes of time .
would not recommend for the price .
it 's not worth the money .
you pay $ _num_ just to get in .
everything else like train ride , pumpkin etc , you need to pay extra .
ripoff !
what a disappointment .
no one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us .
we could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to .
the corn they were selling up front was so small and dried up .
the petting zoo and play area was closed .
this `` pumpkin patch '' stinks !
do n't waste your time or money !
the pumpkin patch is n't even a patch !
also the employees really need some lessons on their customer service and friendliness !
i 'm sorry , but this `` pumpkin patch '' was horrible !
this is n't really a pumpkin patch .
the setup of this place is horrible !
horrible layout !
anyways ... who am i to judge , right ?
like i said earlier , we lasted there about _num_ minutes .
i sure as hell hope so .
corn maze was the only redeeming part of this trip .
sooo many of them would n't last until halloween .
not a real pumpkin patch either .
parking is a chaotic mess .
we had a terrible experience .
i said nowhere that you could n't run .
do n't waste your time .
this year , it was awful .
if i could give them _num_ i would .
these people are so rude .
they were so excited .
needless to say we got there and the two ladies were so rude .
did not honor their website posting and turned my crying kids away .
do n't waste your time .
they never fail .
the red chile was a deep , dark red and looked very old .
food was nasty and lady who took order was rude .
do not recommend .
no restrooms .
they were so rude and the cook is an idiot .

seriously can not stand this mcdonald 's .
they never get my order right .
service is sorry !
you guys are terrible !
worst mcdonalds i have ever gone to .
the customer service is horrible , they are always rude .
drive thru is even worse because the wait is so long .
mongolian pork not enough pork .
sesame chicken too soggy .
too much rice and noodles as sides not enough entre .
this place deserves nothing .
i got house chicken and chicken fried rice .
are you kidding me ?
they asked me how much of it i ate .
making it seem like there doing me a favor .
to find out there 's no way out of this .
to me , bad business all around .
screwed up the order _num_ times .
still no food .
no manager , or anyone in charge we can speak with .
but there wo n't be a next time .
never ordering from here again .
save yourself a headache , time and money !
worst food ever !
this place is now called number _num_ chinese .
the food is entirely tasteless and slimy .
worst chinese place every !
do not go here for anything , the place is dirty is hell too.
only one stylist was there .
bad job , i will never go back .
: - ( still , very bad job .
overall bad business !
literally the worst decision i 've made this week !
the sole reason for my visit .
and tried to tell me my white hairs were n't there .
lady i 'm not blind !
she put absolutely no product in my hair .
what a waste of time and money !
the invoice shows $ _num_ in parts alone and $ _num_ in labor .
i would rather grow my food in the arizona desert .
i had the worse customer service at self check out today .
i do n't want to come back to this store anymore at all .
they are a rip-off .
no help at all .
the guy who works nights here is a real piece of shit .
the employees here are horrible .
i stopped going here a long time ago because of that .
they make you feel extremely uncomfortable & unwelcome .
that was a mistake .
( in contrast , us airways center staff have always been amazingly helpful . )
about an hour later , she returned to our section ... all smiles .
this place was way too loud .
avoid this rink at all costs .
section _num_ row x to be exact .
i do n't recommend going to this venue for true hockey fans .
concert admission was $ _num_ .
the traffic getting into the parking lot was slower than slow and terrible .
the line getting inside was _num_ times worst .
some people waited for _num_ hours and we got in the same time .
worst process in the world !
horrible organization and planning .

doors were supposed to open at _num_ .
not nearly everyone was in yet and they turned off the lights .
poor all around .
we wo n't be going back .
security is not consistent .
horrible service all around !
overall workers are very hostile and unpleasant .
i come to this arena from tucson and have been there on several occasions .
their attitudes are consistently snobby and rude .
most people are n't aware of this rule and will proceed as normal .
the arena employees are kinda jerks about telling guest about this rule .
what the hell .
this place is freaking ridiculous .
the first visit was awesome .
no longer was the parking free .
well , they ran out of hot dogs .
learn from our mistakes .
it was very disappointing especially since i was looking forward to it so much .
i dont think i will be returning here again .
when i got to my mani i really did n't appreciate the rush .
he set his timer yet again and started quickly on my cuticles .
he was going so fast he cut me multiple times on both hands .
additionally it was only because he was rushing because of his timer .
i went here for a manicure today and i will never go back .
the technician who did my nails did so in _num_ minutes .
i went here _num_ weeks ago .
the young guy that did them did a terrible job .
i went back another time and had the same young man do a pedicure .
he then filed them without even looking at them , filed my skin !
i have never had such a terrible pedicure .
i will not be back !
horrible customer service .
this place is hit or miss and today was a miss on many levels .
i will visit another salon next time .
i 'm a little disappointed with this salon .
they are a mess .
the only reason i gave _num_ stars was because of the price .
i have been to better places with better service .
it should not be the luck of the draw .
this place is a dirty mess !
never again and hopefully nobody ever goes here again !
not really that impressed with this place at all ... .
there never seems to be any good parking either .
it seems like there are never enough cashiers .
service here is going down hill fast at this store !
customer service sucks .
outrageous .
very annoying when you try to get help and people ignore you .
as for the store , ... like every other walmart .
worst customer service ever .
waited in line for _num_ mins the lines were _num_ to _num_ people deep .
all the lines can be _num_ or _num_ deep .
i explained the situation and he said he would send another associate .
by now there are _num_ people in line .
unfortunately , these experiences are more the norm than the exception .
if that was the case , i would deal with it .
dirty , someone will always follow you and ask you for money .
most employees do n't want to be there .
this is not tolerable in any such form !
when i asked to speak with a supervisor the employee was rude .
it looks like he was offended to even ask for one .
when i asked to speak with a supervisor the employee was rude .
it looks like he was offended to even ask for one .
there were another _num_ customers there as well .
i wait _num_ minutes to get the damn necklace .
i waited another _num_ minutes just to pay for the item .
but these last couple of months have been ridiculous .
it is horrible .
the female owner is rude and should never own a business .
this subway is horrible .
horrible service .
took forever for the lady to even figure out we were standing there waiting .
probably took her _num_ minutes to make the sub .
slow and unfriendly !
the cookie was disgusting and overcooked .
not coming back here again that 's for sure .
not a place that i like to shop .
i do not feel like anyone cares when you go in there .
i usually love kohl 's .
i was not impressed with my experience today .
i could n't believe the mess the folded jeans were in .
it looked like black friday x _num_ .
after finally finding the correct size , i proceeded to check out .
when he realized that did n't work , he proceeded to use the gun .
i also had another coupon and he took my phone from me again .
i was very ready to get out of the store .
she replied no we have n't had that since christmas .
my mom and i had a terrible experience with the manager at this store !
instead , customer service insisted that my mom give back her kohl 's cash .
this is a rotten store .
unbelievable .
it just appears to me they need to be a little more careful .
i am absolutely disgusted in the manager erica at this location .
she then asked me if i had id .
i will not be returning to mcdonalds after this .
horrible service , typical for mcdonald 's .
they lack customer service , the drive thru is extremely slow .
then i tried to order fries and was told that they had no fries !
after that , i could n't believe it and did n't order anything .
why do you guys do this ?
not drive thru .
had it been the chicken i would have understood ... .
i like their sauce but that price is too damn high .
i will probably not come here again just for that reason .
friendly staff but the food was garbage .
it was barely okay .
the environment was not great and the staff was not very friendly .
nor would i recommend anyone come here .
this is the second time that something goes wrong with my daughters hair here.
unfortunately this location is a huge let down .
the drive thru is never busy unlike mcdonalds which is a few feet away .
wrong !
i tasted no difference from any other run of the mill bacon burger .
i do n't recommend eating here .
so , i started to go inside to get my order .
once , they got my order wrong and were able to correct it .
but twice , the dining room was closed !
probably not .
i am tired of going to this location and getting incorrect food .
terrible service and i will not be back .
went in for an oil change with a coupon for $ _num_ .
oil change was cheaper at the dealer .
wo n't be back .
unfortunately their quote was well above that of discount tire .
as our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries .
very disappointed .
the service on the weekends is very slow .
it 's `` almost '' the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .
then your order is completely wrong anyways .
fries usually have way too much salt on them and/or are old .
this is literally the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
the food quality is terrible and the customer service is n't any better .
you just ca n't win here !
a store should n't be ran this way .
$ _num_ seems outrageous .
also , the man who works there is so rude .
which i 'm sure wo n't bother the man working there at all .
overpriced and extremely rude to customers .
do yourself a favor and avoid this business .
so disappointed .
this place gets a _num_ star out of _num_ .
there is a bit of a wait to get your order though .
lets just say i wo n't be back .
and my concern is the place didnt look busy at all .
is wont waste the time or money to eat here again .
i went to pick up inside and that was a big mistake .
seriously the worst smell hit me as soon as i walked in the door .
but yeah , very dirty , gross smelling restaurant .
my silverware was dirty along with my glass .
not me .
i will not eat there again .
i should had trusted my gut and checked my pizza before going home .
to my fault i trusted the employees , bad call .
no olives whatsoever , like _num_ mushrooms and _num_ onion slices .
my husband i went into the restaurant today at _num_ .
the restaurant was busy , but not overwhelmingly so .
while we were standing by the front , two other people were helped .
even as we turned to leave , not a single employee acknowledged our presence .
i 've been to kim 's before and it was n't a good experience .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
find another place that 'll save you the headache !
came here about 8:30 pm on a monday night , not particularly busy .
are you kidding me ?
disgusting .
they never seem to get it right .
one of the worst drive-thru experience ever !
turn on ur volume on ur head phone should be the first priority .
have n't been to sonic before , will go to another location next time .
fyi be ready to repeat your order over and over .
pizza tasted good but i will not be using this location again .
this place is n't even professional at all .
waited patiently for about an hour and they still had n't delivered my food .
i will not be ordering from there anymore .
so far , not super impressed with this school .
not an administration that cares about its students .
do not move into this place .
management is absolutely horrible , maintenance takes forever to come out to fix anything .
just recently moved out and they tried to take every penny from me .
it is not stated in the lease .
terrible apartments , do not move in !
from the get go , no one seemed to know what they were doing .
this is probably the worse place i have ever lived .
to make it more disgusting , it was still there a week later .
cleanliness and sanitation is obviously not a priority at this property .
same with the pool and hot tub .
beyond rude , beyond unprofessional , and beyond insulting .
are you kidding me ?
these people are dishonest , rude , and unprofessional .
you can find cheaper ( and nicer ) apartments in the same area .
i guess that got forgotten when _num_ of _num_ pipes broken : ( .
if i could rate this place a _num_ , i would .
i suspect this is because they want every chance to keep your deposit .
arrival time is not predictable when you 're driving over _num_ hours ) .
those days are long gone .
they were replaced by a rude , inconsiderate , and condescending staff .
our downstairs neighbors were horrible .
crystal springs did absolutely nothing about this , despite several complaints .
no payment options on their website .
always doing maintenance on the apartments so you are threatened to be towed constantly .
the maintenance takes a very long time to ever get back to you .
they always seem to be trying to get more money out of you .
the dining room was clean and the people were friendly .
i 'll go back , but i 'll be staying in my car .
anyway , i did n't receive a receipt .
not until i get home do i realize that they forgot the baked potato .
anyway , i am very disappointed in the quality of service .
wendy 's is not fine dining .
on both account this wendy 's has failed .
the first time went through the drive thru they got my order wrong .
but the fries were cold and stale .
the burger was barely warm .
just went through the drive thru .
well , after $ _num_ + in food i expect a receipt .
talk about false advertisement .
made _num_ calls in an attempt to hire these people and give them money .
guess business is so good they do n't need to return phone calls .
too late .
do n't waste your time .
nothing stands out as amazing but nothing was bad .
toe nails were cut really short to the point of hurting her .
my feet were so dry afterwards .
well , i feel horrible for taking them here .
lynn has been doing my eyebrows for a while now .
almost _num_ hours later and they are still in pain .
she was extremely rude and very unprofessional .
i will never be back nor will i refer anyone .
whatever he put on my nails would not come off .
tech kept asking me if i wanted to rent my second home .
these are supposed to be trained professionals , completely unacceptable .
my husband walked in and ordered a large veggie with italian sausage .
first we have been getting pizza and wings from here for years .
very apologetic and returned our money .
worst i ever ate .
majority of pizza was tomato soaked dough .
something tasted stale on the toppings .
disgusting !
i hate that my last few reviews have been negative .
sorry , but i will never go there again .
if i could give them a zero star i would .
this place was awful .
just awful person and owner .
sent my husband to pick our items up .
also the chemical or water smell that was on our clothes was horrible .
it did n't smell like cleaning materials it literally smelled like mold mildew water .
we were so embarrassed !
not so good .
got very sick after eating the mahi mahi and macaroni salad .
no food is good enough to make up for the horrible service i got .
grease paradise .
but the last couple of visits was not the same !
totally cut their food cost down half !
also , they do n't serve good tea anymore .
the need to move josh back up to the front .
i will not be back here for a very long time .
the restaurant also needs a remodel very badly , very run down and dirty .
more than likely wo n't ever go back .
to make things worst , the kalbi had a lack of taste .
why do you have to do this to my favorite food ?
i was totally disappointed .
not anymore .
the place is n't busy like it used to be .
no wonder .
went there yesterday hoping to get a couple salads for lunch .
the only reason this establishment gets one star is for the food being edible .
i 'm not entirely convinced that the meat was even chicken at all .
my wife and daughter went to ono to get takeout .
waited over _num_ minutes to get order .
brought the takeout home and all three meals , the chicken was raw !
the macaroni salad tasted terrible .
never going back .
went to pick up four meals tonight for family 's dinner .
got home and the hawaiian beef from one of the meals was missing .
every time we go , at least one item is missing .
i was placed on hold for _num_ mins and then hung up on .
tried calling back and line was busy .
food was good but the owner should consider using the ac .
the employees just do seem to care .
never again go to this place .
horrible business ethics !
they do n't deserve our business !
so that leaves my cashier alone with a line of customers .
have n't been since late november .
it was my favorite department store .
the store was a mess .
really nasty .
such a disappointment .
will not go back .
long lines to check out .
horrible customer service .
i have to wait _num_ min .
to return a charger that does n't work .
have had to wait over an hour on numerous occasions .
there was no reason i had to go to the store to begin with .
i 'm just so glad website like yelp exist .
absolutely awful in store customer service and awful wait times .
completely frustrating and sad .
they factory reset my phone and i lost everything .
coming to this verizon is like buying a used car !
waiting for over _num_ minutes watching workers on their phones not helping anyone .
customer service is not very good .
cesar was a complete jerk , extremely rude .
but , if this order is lost , i will be changing the rating .
today two almost three years after renting from them and paying everything on time .
do n't rent from these guys .
i called the office today and there was no management present .
that is probably the only good thing about this place .
the new staff are terrible and do n't care about there residents .
if you complain about noise , forget it .
they said they gave us a bull but i never received anything .
the other amount was for damage closet and our water bill .
i have lived in three different apartments and never dealt with this much crap .
reason for _num_ star , is maintenance .
complex is very poorly run .
water is turned off about _num_ times a month with no warning .
pool is always dirty , looks like it may be cleaned once a week .
hot tub always has trash in or around it .
dogs that are n't allowed are on promises .
they say one animal per unit , some people have _num_ .
would not stay here ever again .
not to mention bed bugs !
this place is my worst nightmare come true .
these apartments are horrible .
can not wait until my lease is over .
never renting here again .
to much rent for such horrible apartments .
not worth it here .
the managers are horrible too .
do n't seem to have answers for anything .
i 've never been to any apartments where the staff was this bad .
nothing works .
third problem is the appliances are outdated and breaking down .
anyone interested , i have photos of security asleep .
the apartment is nice , but the place is poorly run .
not even the toilet !
our garage broke and the office did nothing .
there were drug dealers above and below us .
not worth the price if it 's not maintained .
and yes these things have been mentioned to the staff numerous times .
price is not worth it .
all they do is whip down the tanning surface .
have enough hours in the day to tan .
so i went in today to cancel .
but they have totally lost my business .
unbelievable .
it 's awful .
someone should teach them how to smile !
that was enough for me to never come back .
i used petsmart for the grooming services .
i said yes and then left my little guy in there to get groomed .
all she did was barely sand the tips down .
did n't cut anything off !
so i paid $ _num_ for my dog to basically have nothing done .
sorry , my dog has some life to him .
_num_ star is being to generous !
my dog just left the groomers and i am pissed !
worst service ever !
he was just kept locked up in a cage for the first _num_ hours .
also in this time the only groomed _num_ other dogs .
i will not bring my dog back here ever again .
i am highly disgusted .
do not shop here , do not encourage this behavior .
the place was clean , the employees were nice .
everything from the start to finish of my order was wrong !
i simply ordered _num_ chicken wraps , _num_ cheeseburgers , and two large blizzards .
i had to repeat my order _num_ times for the cashier .
it was like they mixed dirt or sand into it .
one bite had _num_ or _num_ pecans in it !
the whole place is ran by a bunch of teenagers who just dont care .
blizzards are lacking ingredients and not mixed well .
orders get mixed up and you end up with the wrong blizzard .
horrible .
me and my gf finally gave up on going .
_num_ scoops like _num_ .
anywho , we picked out a regular _num_ in .
then , she just went and got a _num_ in .
the manager disappointed me that she did not put forth her proper manager skills .
the least she could do was apologize .
and the fries are nasty .
they just lost a valued customer .
no stars !
just horrible service what more can i say .
dirty store and attitudes is not a great summer ice cream trip .
the food is disgusting and cold here .
i will never take my business here again especially with this stupid manager .
front staff was nice and professional .
dr baker was professional .
literally , dragon garden has all the ambiance of a dunkin ' doughnuts .
ok , this is not lobster sauce .
it did n't taste bad , just bland .
again , not bad , just bland .
fried rice = dry rice tossed in soy sauce .
you 'll probably never have to wait in line .
tl ; dr version : go for lunch specials , bring hot sauce .
this place is disgusting .
that should have been my clue .
the teriyaki chicken was dry and hard on the edges .
the chicken lo mein was super salty .
the egg rolls tasted old .
really if i order orange chicken and fried rice should n't i get that ?
there 's higher quality chinese for the same price .
this has to be the worst oil change place on the planet .
horrible customer service high prices and overall a pain in the neck .
needing my radiator fluid topped off was bs !
rude , rude , rude .
i mean , come on , you 're in the service industry .
first time going to jiffy lube and it will be my last .
big ripoff .
no a/c in waiting room long wait and overpriced !
complete rip go elsewhere .
would any other `` hospital '' turn away a potential dying patient ?
all of my animals go to palm valley , love dr hatch !
they do n't care about your animals .
in the last year we have had _num_ major issues where _num_ .
she was very harsh and refused to help us out .
but none of my family will return because of dee .
however , this last experience forced me to look elsewhere .
if your hurting for business , dee could be your problem .
frustrating .
it was horrible .
first of all no cheese and very little steak .
and this is the last time i will step foot at taco bell .
fake mexican food .
they do n't give you much food.
called up this auto shop to get a check engine light diagnosed .
sounded reasonable so i scheduled an appointment .
are you kidding me ?
if i wanted something google 'd i could have done that myself .
clearly the tech who rotated my tires did n't put it back on properly .
i 'm really disappointed .
no respect for property what do ever .
handed the keys and was told _num_ hours .
after an hour i call back to hear nothing has been done .
once i got there to pick up my vehicle , there was just apologies .
take the dang cards out when you do n't have the product .
management has no control over these teenagers .
got in my car and drove away quickly .
my dining partner was absolutely angry after getting his order .
but , no .
but , no .
but , no .
i do not recommend this mcdonald 's to anyone .
every time i come here they somehow get my order wrong .
at least _num_ of the cars behind me got served and were passing me .
severely understaffed , huge line , terrible experience .
mcdonalds is bad as it is and this is the worst .
the food is always dry and tastes horrible .
when i got to the window they were charging me a $ _num_ .
so the manager kept arguing with me and then rudely walked away .
she would not talk to me at all .
the manager refused to give me her name so i could call and complain .
and sometimes the drive thru is just ridiculous .
get your shit together there !
things are over cooked .
just plain nasty .
avoid this place !
slowest drive thru in the history of `` fast '' food .
possibly consider ordering your next meal at the same time .
they ordered it because it is n't stocked .
screw this place not even recommended to my enemy 's .
my order should n't have been that complicated or taking that long .
drive through is incredibly slow .
my last drive through visit took _num_ minutes with only _num_ cars in line .
i get home , guess what ?
no cheese , no bacon but i did get those tomatoes !
last years was a terrible mess .
erica is _num_ % right !
you might as well go to h & r block down the street .
said no thanks got my stuff and left .
i usually drive around a couple times to get a gas pump .
i do n't know any other _num_ year old who does that .
i would never go back to that office again .
i 'm disgusted with this store .
my hubs and i went in tonight .
with costco you get better perks , but i was interested in inventory .
you 'd rather lose my business ?
crap store and people not very nice .
so i 've never had a bad experience until today .
today there was only one self check out lane open and _num_ registers .
over the years the customer service has always been blah .
has no name tag or anything to show he 's a manager .
than he just walks away after he leaves me with the cashier .
yeah they just have another manager in the club call me .
i 'm not real picky .
get in , get what i need , get out ... no problems .
i recently ordered a product online for something they had in the store .
should n't be a big deal , right ?
i would have to come back sunday .
that seems to be a mission critical function at a car wash .
fortunately , i was paying attention .
so goes my feelings toward this starbucks .
if in the area again ... i would n't go back .
will skip this one for sure when in the area .
this was november _num_ .
it all tastes the same to me ... the same strange grill flavor .
hatch
if i could give negative five stars i would .
it was that bad .
i walked around some more with no help in sight .
my last stop in the store was near the towels .
the taco and relleno plate was just horrible .
a mush of egg and bad cheese .
taco was dripping oil .
my sister 's huevos rancheros were n't much better .
bland tomato sauce .
we 'll never go back .
the tamale was an extremely thick coating of masa with very dry meat .
my husband 's chimichanga was the same overly dry meat .
this restaurant is n't what i expected .
it was n't good at all .
overall the only thing i did enjoy was their lemonade .
i tasted the rice and left it .
the enchilada was disgusting .
it had even less cheese inside than the tostada had beans .
i am not sure how we even stayed at that point .
at noon there were only _num_ tables with guests .
it is just nasty there .
horribly executed food !
the burritos were so salty and dry .
all nasty meat with no extras .
no credit here .
the food tastes stale .
big mistake .
we left our plates barely touched .
i got food poisoning , and their food was bland .
their chile relleno was an over cooked chile omelet .
all of it .
my boyfriend ordered two carne asada tacos and two carnitas tacos .
very bland .
some had tomatoes , some did n't .
some had cheese , some did n't .
the dinner was just terrible .
soooo disappointed !
went for breakfast on a saturday morning , fully expecting it to be busy .
waited _num_ minutes to be sat .
waited _num_ minutes for drink order to be taken .
waited _num_ minutes for drinks .
waited _num_ more minutes for food order .
waited _num_ minutes for food with no table touch or explanation .
i also told him it was about the worst service or food ever !
and when we did get our food , it was incorrect and cold .
i ca n't do cold food after a _num_ minute wait with no explanation .
i just realized why we have n't eaten in this place for a while .
the manager came over and apologized , gave us a discount .
we will not dine in this ihop again .
disappointing !
consistent bad service and the food is always cold .
slow service at this time of night so be prepared .
very slow , but very nice .
booth seats were a tad messy .
breakfast took about _num_ minutes to come out .
we all left still hungry because we hated our food .
all in all , worse service i have ever experienced .
have no clue what they were but they had every meat possible with salsa .
wrong !
the adults still do not have silverware or jelly .
he suggested they make another and she declined stating she lost her appetite anyways .
he then asked me if there was anything else and i stated `` no .
i simply stated `` no it was n't '' and she apologized .
the `` check out attendant '' was extremely rude .
the only good thing about the trip was the food .
which they were .
the worst part ... our food took over an hour .
there were probably _num_ other tables in the restaurant .
that is ridiculous !
this place is terrible they take forever !
we 've been waiting over _num_ minutes just for our appetizer !
we got seated waited _num_ minutes and nobody showed up , worst service ever .
we in yesterday for breakfast .
after about _num_ minutes a hispanic family was seated behind us .
after coming here my next choice will be anywhere else but ihop .
i do not like the choices or the menu change .
everything seemed very generic and bland not only to me but everyone else .
it is not worth the prices .
these ladies work hard and did deserve the tip for their service .
the girls were n't able to pick them up until the week of .
we were so excited to see them in there dresses .
terrible !
go elsewhere , do not waste your time .
no discount was given to groom or bridesmaid .
do not go to this place , it is horrible .
this issue is that the customer service is not that good .
ok the story .
my last visit i was shopping for what supposed to be a quick project .
bear in mind i spent over _num_ minutes in one aisle with _num_ kids .
then it happens an employee talks to me yay !
you lost my business home depot .
i 've been to this home depot several times .
the end result was that i left my loaded cart and walked out .
pathetic customer service .
the girl had long fake nails , acting like she 's all that .
the man in the wheelchair in the plumbing department was rude and condescending .
i do n't live here thank goodness .
how about this idea ... .
afterwards i went to lowes and had the opposite experience .
employees approached me and asked if i needed any help .
waited forever for my order to be taken , forever to receive it .
almost $ _num_ for a _num_ piece combo that should have been wings .
that 's the only reason i am not giving one star .
worst church 's chicken ever .
big mistake .
worst part , the chicken was disgusting .
i did n't even feed that chicken to my dog .
this company does n't care about it 's customers .
they have n't called me to say they 're sorry to make things right .
corporate in new jersey says they only reserve the rate , not a truck .
if i could give no stars i would .
three days later i am charged _num_ by budget .
the meat was seriously over cooked , and the beans and rice were bland .
my husband makes way better carne asada , cooked to perfection .
it possibly could be better with a few beers .
we will not be going back .
red and green burrito 's are very bland .
rice was mushy .
beans , tamale , taco , chips and salsa were ok .
no carne asada for tacos or burritos .
that is just strange .
that 's was the only good thing .
most of the meat was fatty and blah flavored .
so , in we walked and sat in a booth .
the under side of the plate was not clean .
the buffet was lacking in a lot of ways .
the food was horrible !
it was a really bad experience .
i do not know why , but my experiences here have never been good .
i am not kidding either ; folks who go with me are always amazed .
once we finally get an order in it takes another _num_ or more .
why why why ?
i have given this place so many chances i just can not continue .
they were almost shut down because it was so bad .
apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair .
the food was n't very good .
i would n't recommend it .
the decor is old and not very clean .
the food is over spiced and still not very tasty .
i dont think we will be returning .
this place just has bad food .
i 've been there twice and been disappointed both times .
all i remember from the first time was the shockingly horrible rice and beans .
i thought there food left much to be desired .
i did like the shabby , but cute atmosphere .
the service is about as bad as i have experienced anywhere .
the sauce for my sonoran enchilada was awful .
i have no clue !
you will be disappointed !
very unsatisfied .
the manager did n't really seem like she even cared about us leaving .
so i 'm starting to review the places on my list .
the decor in the restaurant really needs an update .
my husband got the chorizo burro with egg and cheese .
i am not sure what dinner he ate .
it 's hit or miss .
wont be going back !
it is not terrible but there are much better mexican food places .
this place was awful .
i 'd rather have taco bell .
my dinner had no flavor at all and the service was slow at best .
very sad .
i still ca n't figure out why everyone likes this place .
even the meat is fatty and not very tasty .
pay for your drink and run out of the door like now !
neither responded to my hello and thank you to them .
neither my wife or i could drink it .
not an enjoyable night at a place we normally really like .
unfortunately ca n't say the same about the service .
some and have no idea what customer service is .
have never been properly trained .
not very busy at exactly noon on a friday .
that should have given me a clue .
i put my order in just _num_ minutes after the tea arrived .
i tried to like the salsa and chips but just could n't .
the chips were hard and tasted almost stale .
this time i flagged down a waitress willing to speak with me .
she said she would check on my food .
i have no clue why people enjoy restaurants like this one .
very disappointing meal .
i would not recommend this restaurant !
new management sucks and these new rules are stupid .
i should of just hung up and made other plans for lunch .
i hate bad customer service and bad phone skills .
we have encountered more horrible experiences with this company than better .
his response `` i do n't care . ''
i will admit that at this point i lost it .
you can purchase a dvd just like everyone else . ''
steve 's response again was `` i do n't care . ''
that is the absolute worst part of the whole ordeal for me .
overall poor service .
truck sat there almost _num_ weeks and nothing .
terrible bowling alley .
the place was empty .
i was charged $ _num_ for the kids and us for _num_ games .
so we left after about _num_ minutes .
but this was a complete rip off .
they also had a very poor selection of balls .
after fifteen , the manager came out and yelled at the staff .
unfortunately , del taco falls short .
the quality as a whole at del taco has seem to gone downhill fast .
this does n't appear to be the case with del taco .
i will not be going back to del taco any time soon .
this place is ridiculous !
if there were stars for less than one , that would be my choice .
we saw couples walk up to the patio and finish before we received ours .
just in a hurry and lacked some people skills .
all in all , i wo n't be returning .
they ca n't get in order correct .
they wanted dq , but it 's pretty far away .
they do n't compare at all with a dq blizzard .
horrible service .
it did n't arrive for ten minutes , then the cc system went down .
i have been waiting over _num_ minutes for my cc to get it back .
it is 8:30 and still waiting for cc back .
i am now late for a meeting .
here was my chance during my trip to arizona .
it 's no in-n-out .
while i really like whataburger , i ca n't stand this location .
it takes like a plain vanilla shake .
i was very disappointed .
_num_ tiny tiny hush puppies are $ _num_ .
it did n't worth it .
just finished my lunch @ ed 's .
even gave me a free sample of deep fried oyster .
maybe the burgers or sandwiches are better but i 'll never know .
wo n't be going back .
this place was awful !
would not go back , not if you paid me .
had a small tattoo done , check my pics to see it .
first emailed , when i did n't hear back , i called .
guy who answered was rude , so i blew it off .
even though i 'm totally unable to do a weekday .
no he says ... the bowl is the same price .
nasty !
this place is ridiculous !
ice cream is good but service is terrible !
well , not terrible but really slow .
they had _num_ employees there who could 've been helping with customers .
really big disappointment .
customer service needs improvement .
did n't bother to set them up for customers .
took about _num_ minutes to get my ice cream .
threw everything away and left .
not good !
worst service ever .
stock items on counters where food is .
slow , slow , slow ... .
seriously the worst staff ever !
what a disaster this place is .
the employees obviously hate their jobs and they have awful management .
there was an issue at the cash register .
no wonder the employees hate their jobs .
some of the worst service i 've experienced in a long time .
the air condition was n't working .
disappointed !
and drops it in anyways .
that was some straight up walmart customer service .
he was such a dick and lacked complete customer satisfaction .
i will be sticking with dq after this poor experience .
there were two female technicians doing manicures and one male technician doing the pedicure .
_num_ minutes later and he is just coming over to start on my feet .
i am not sure how often he does pedicures .
the basic pedi was $ _num_ .
asked ann to level out my tips and they are still crooked .
i can see why they are slow .
the front office staff is always rude for no reason at all .
the least they could have done was a drug test , but nope .
have an emergency , go to urgent care .
i do n't have an appointment .
worst doctors office i 've ever been to .
spent _num_ hours waiting to see someone between two visits .
never actually saw a md .
go to anyone else , they are so unprofessional .
yeah , this is n't really my place .
not so bueno .
i admit , i got out of here in a hurry .
probably wo n't be coming back .
if you are looking for eye candy then do n't go there .
the crowd was pretty ghetto and not too much to add more there .
the drinks were ok with mixed drinks & shots at $ _num_ .
it then goes up to over _num_ bucks !
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
in my book that 's _num_ strikes your out !
i was also wondering when the gang fight was going to break out .
its no wonder way drink are cheap here .
bunch of good looking military boys and cheap drinks kept me coming back .
they have pool tables prices are cheap which is good .
unfortunately over the last couple of years this place has gone downhill .
but this place has turned from a dive bar to just trash .
fights all the time and place just seems extra dirty .
just the overall atmosphere of patrons has took a turn for the worst .
the absolute worst excuse for a bar i have ever experienced in my life .
approached by the bar tender .
but for about _num_ % of the time we were there .
looking for a true hole in the wall with mediocre service ?
i have literally never had a correct order here .
and the things that are correct , are horribly cooked .
this place was horrible .
on top of all that the customer service was bad .
one star , only because no stars is not an option .
if i could give zero stars i would .
its all very confusing .
i go out to the range area and start hitting balls .
so i take the unit back , no problem they give me another .
we would appreciate a clean shower stall .
as i enter my shower that i was assigned .
just _num_ face towel and _num_ towel .
the toilet was filthy .
there is no hair dryer provided .
i 'm very disappointed with this pilot .
i will not fuel or shower at this location again .
the management is overwhelmingly rude and the price they charge for fax is outrageous .
save your money ppl buy a fax .
just ridiculous !
no one greeted me so i left .
i have been a long time weekly customer of this car wash .
however , today they lost a customer , `` me '' .
he gave me a _num_ % discount card .
no big deal of course as far as the loss !
glad you sent out a notice to everyone on this !
we noticed how the workers kept watching us which made us feel very uncomfortable .
i am so sorry to hear about what happen to your daughter .
this place sold me a detail for my vehicle and quoted me an hour .
i ended up waiting for _num_ hours !
i am pretty disappointed in the quality of the service i got .
the floor mats were partially done and one side put back upside down .
on the plus side my windows and mirrors were really clean .
bad customer service .
no help from the manager .
it sucked .
just disappointing that this happens .
waste of time and money !
what an awful experience .
are not flexible will only go with their packages .
might as well go to a normal self drive thru wash .
i paid $ _num_ for a car wash and hand wax with detail .
wo n't be back .
i was not given a physical menu of services to review .
i was given _num_ options .
there were over _num_ options .
one cheaper than the _num_ .
why was i told i would get the _num_ option and no other options ?
he just charged me to the _num_ option .
do not come here , they will rip you off .
never imagined i should check yelp for a car wash review .
i find it incredibly hard to believe that this place has such glowing reviews .
after bringing the car home fluid was leaking all over the garage floor .
i went in to get a quick diagnosis on my muffler .
ok gel manicure .
the whole process took way too long and i was left with nothing special .
the awkward small talk really made things that much worse .
i will not be returning .
this nail salon is horrible .
the bad : both our nails looked bad when we left .
spend your money elsewhere .
acrylic was thick , uneven , lumpy , crooked , you name it .
gel was lumpy and uneven .
no , will not return .
put into another room that was n't totally cleaned .
would n't show bill to us .
then they asked me to bring a check & leave under flower pot .
still no bill to review .
frequently no one on premises .
place used to be spectacular , new owners have run into ground .
if you wan na wait for _num_ mins at a drive thru ... .
what a nightmare !
do n't waste your time .
do you remember al 's slow food ?
this place is garbage !
immediately noticed that part of the order was missing .
they were extremely smashed !
to make a long story short , the coffee was cold and watered down .
avoid this location !
horrible !
this was my first time ever going to this location , and my last .
first , it 's hard to hear the person on the speaker .
no idea .
there was n't .
so i spent a lifetime in line , and drove away with nothing .
my bacon burger and fries were barely warm .
i did n't have high expectations ; it 's fast food .
wo n't come back here , and probably wo n't try another location .
horrible .
messed up our order and poor customer service .
but i 'm a designer & everything is not american made like they claim .
wish we would have been left alone to browse .
put anything longer than a _num_ iron away off the back tees .
half my shots were to something i could n't see .
beautiful golf course in a lovely setting , but the course management is poor .
just stop and go home ?
i would have no interest in playing this course a second time .
staff was rude .
conditions were terrible .
with the fees they charge , warm up balls should be free .
the practice facility is small , very small .
oh crap , no hard liquor ... .
last comment , do stop for lunch at the resort restaurant .
the restaurant did n't meet our standard though .
the menu was just standard , the service was dreadful .
it used to be so good really disappointing !
i love southwestern food ... and i was very let down by this place .
i lost my appetite after a few bites .
we were really disappointed .
the decor is definitely southwestern but way over the top cheesy southwestern .
, the food is just not good .
waitress had some kind of piss poor attitude .
i would have been better off asking the floor tiles to serve us .
our experience last night left us so disappointed .
it was not busy but the service was again terrible .
would not go back .
basically this place really need to justify its prices .
i had to get my order custom made , and left kind of disappointed .
but considering the fact that i went there for food it was a disappointment .
the side order of wild rice was simply not edible .
the food in this restaurant left me disappointed and hungry .
do n't come here for the food .
i guess our server needed us out in a hurry .
it all ruined a relaxing night i was looking forward to .
the only redeeming thing about this place was the view .
the margaritas were n't even good .
it was not even a busy time .
our waitress was fine but we were clearly being rushed through our courses .
we spent more time in the car coming & going than we did eating .
hostess was not inviting .
i was so very disappointed today at lunch .
he was very curt when we questioned him about menu items etc .
we sat for 30-40 minutes with empty glasses of water .
what a disappointment .
not close to being worth a $ _num_ dinner .
trust me the attitude of the restaurant is not worth it .
if you really want anything they sell here , order it online .
so for a `` we hate everybody that is not like us .
things are looking , well , tired .
women that were working were as friendly as dirt .
prime rib for $ _num_ ?
sure why not .
i just wish i had fresh horseradish .
also , a little more attention from the waitress would 've been nice .
the place was empty .
for the food we got to eat , i was n't too impressed .
the beef ribs were way to fatty .
the corn on the cob was my favorite part .
more organization and better food is needed for this event !
the service is the worst i 've have ever experienced .
the hostess need to find another job was not friendly .
there were two girls working that have no business being behind a bar .
beyond that , you do n't come here for the food .
over priced , over cooked , small amount of food served .
eh ... the food is ok .
nothing to write home about and i 've had better elsewhere .
the food was pretty bad for the price .
i thought that $ _num_ was pretty expensive .
we wo n't be going back .
not impressed .
and they were probably the highlight of my dinner .
this place sucks .
the food was average at best .
i was dragged there by friends .
it was unbelievable what they served .
the ribs were literally all fat .
it was totally inedible .
no one sat us ; we arranged tables ourselves outside .
a waiter eventually came _num_ minutes later to get our drink orders .
prices for the food are too high , especially since the quality is bad .
the sauteed onions sat in a pool of grease on top of the burger .
i do n't know where all the good reviews are coming from .
slow , confused service .
i only go back because other cave creek bars are n't much better .
nearly everything that could go wrong did .
this place is dying .
shot specials at _num_ a shot ?
im from pit and will never come back here .
place is crazy expensive and was not busy .
alcohol is way more expensive than the chip .
with that being said , the service continues to be mediocre to poor .
very annoying to say the least .
we have resolved ourselves that the service will be bad and the seating slow .
not crowded .
not because the boss would care .
... _num_ minutes after arrival still no water or coffee offered .
very disappointed by management at this place .
they gave us a reservation , promised they would show the game .
they were rude and did n't care in the slightest .
if you like jerks , you 'll like this place .
sorry , wo n't make another trip back .
it 's not for me and i would not recommend other people to it .
i have been here dozens of times and live just a couple miles away .
the food was not even as good as i could make at home .
the bloody mary was bland and tasted like the mix was ready to turn .
the service is terrible .
i 've waited at a table for service for _num_ hours before .
it 's ridiculous .
i give this place another chance every _num_ months .
we decided we 'd stop in today to grab a drink .
but what was disturbing is that every single table was filthy !
there were flies all over the old food , and drinks !
flies , plates and plates of old food !
mediocre at best !
this rating is based on policy , not food .
will not come back .
came with coleslaw that either had the worst dressing or had gone bad .
but i was quite disgusted with one thing .
sadly , that was n't what disgusted me .
wings were greasy not like the wings we drove here for .
why this place has been around so long is a mystery to me .
probably would n't go back .
the food was so so , and rather expensive .
the service was very slow .
my friend recieved his check and for _num_ people was charged for _num_ .
if i could give this place `` zero '' stars i would !
who the hell orders food and then just leaves .
i was wrong .
oh so wrong .
no wait !
the food left a lot to be desired .
the beef ribs were the worst ever .
wow , what a terrible experience .
first we had to wait to be seated even though there many empty tables .
food is not that good .
worst experience ever !
horrible experience with my service dog !
this paper just makes me tired and bored .
we went out looking for pancakes one sunday morning my bf and i .
big mistake .
do n't do this to your sunday morning .
all the other tables that had arrived after us were served and leaving .
rude and disorganized .
omg ... horrible !
shame on the owners to act like this !
she said in a rude tone that someone will take our order .
we waited another _num_ minutes and no one came out .
so unfriendly and not welcoming at all !
i would give it a zero !
i would never give my hard earned money to people who do not care .
customer service was very poor .
will not stop at this dairy queen again .
i was excited to find a dairy queen close to home .
but , that was short lived .
very rude people except _num_ girl that was new .
any way sorry that i asked for the rest of my order !
the look and attitude was ridiculous .
not sure why they are so mad here .
could act like you want to me here .
not good !
walked in around _num_ pm and the place was a hot mess .
it even tasted strange and rotten .
never had a bad ice cream experience before this one .
times must be tough .
wo n't go back .
it was just nothing special .
i 've made better at home just by trying .
staff was straight faced , minus any warm and fuzzy .
food , albeit just standard fare , came out quickly .
seven tables inside the dining area needed attention and there was no temperature control .
it was freezing cold inside .
i thought by going to the indian village i would get some great food .
when we got the food it looked really appetizing .
the food was very bland ... very bland .
the chicken tacos had no seasoning or anything .
my friends breakfast burrito was not impressive either .
the fry bread was the only thing that was good .
nothing great but nothing awful .
it was horrible .
it was horrible !
i was embarrassed for them when i took a bite into my flavorless taco .
disappointing experience , especially considering the expectations we had based on others ' reviews .
the veal was overly breaded , dry and tasteless .
i got a restaurant.com certificate and tried this restaurant .
the waiter checked and it was a _num_ - still older than we wanted .
he told us once the bottle was opened , there were no returns .
not that i do that regularly , but it 's happened ! )
so , it was not cooked to temperature .
the potatoes were horrible - very disappointing .
our bill came to $ _num_ , including wine and tip .
for a really fabulous meal , i would have been fine with that .
this meal was n't even close to that good .
this just did n't cut the mustard for me .
dinner with friends on valentines day - food pricing absurd - service lousy .
not worth your time or your money - just skip this one .
guess she 's not going back either .
slow ass service !
bland food !
hate food with flavor ?
want to sit around and complain all dinner long ?
very disappointed .
the young staff did not seem to be bothered at all .
i paid the tab with a restaurant.com certificate along with cash .
how stupid do they think people are ?
not that good .
for a group of _num_ ?
it 's painfully obvious that no one has trained the staff .
same experience here .
this for a a _num_ or _num_ star rated restaurant ?
the place and the menu need updates .
it was a disappointment overall .
when i got home i ate a pastry to get the wellington taste out .
that made the atmosphere very awkward .
not really sure why this would be french cuisine .
very , very strange .
not very french .
ordered the champagne chicken which was definitely not fresh chicken breast .
however , my first experience with customer service was such a disappointment !
chuck '' acted disinterested , but took my information .
this is a very expensive job , by the way .
messages left were not returned .
horrible first impression .
if that is the case then we are all in trouble .
these people clearly just want your money !
this is the most unprofessional vet i have every met .
our dog to him .
to her .
said they would call back , to check on our dog .
went to another vet , who cares about your dog .
go to another vet , and save your dog .
it 's not the same by any means .
it 's a cold atmosphere , as well .
it 's sad .
this motel was the worst i 've ever been in .
drive into cave creek , do your shopping and get the heck out .
zero stars .
she was horrible .
she said , if you do n't like it go home .
should have taken a picture , but whatever .
they deserve to go out of business .
we were only maybe _num_ steps into the entrance from the public road .
she is in serious need of heavy medication and possibly a straight jacket .
i worked there _num_ months and walked out .
i worked _num_ hours before i left and she never paid me .
she screamed never to come on her property again .
she cant run this hotel and inventory .
the shipping cost was over $ _num_ in which she was charged .
when i walked out it was still there .
do n't stay here .
this is an over priced , outdated , uncomfortable place .
no outlets in the bathroom and the light switch is in the bedroom .
no directions or any information as to how to get to the place .
my daughter had french toast which could have easily come from a box .
btw the oven was broken so the two house pancake specialties were not available .
total bill for breakfast was $ _num_ not including tip .
it seemed busy enough , so our new breakfast adventure was a foot !
well , _num_ minutes later i had to ask for service .
~ hash browns were very basic and plain .
we waited over _num_ mins to have our drink order taken .
i got the chicken fried steak & eggs & it was not very good .
disgusting .
my glass was empty by 1/2 threw & was never refilled .
i do n't see what the fuss is about .
i posted before about great blue berry cakes .
today _num_ pancakes and maybe _num_ blueberries in all .
understaffed and service is very so-so .
food is very average and typical of a denny 's .
ok , no problem , but wow it was a little rough .
the things we always get there were cold , and not very good .
i would much rather head to another breakfast place in cave creek .
baked apple pancake was horrible ... not worth the wait .
way understaffed and service well that is another story it needs work .
the only thing is that the german pancake _num_ minutes wait and are good .
example $ _num_ for mixed fruit instead of potatoes .
one of the worst experiences in my life !
i could not even get seated .
it 's not really representative of cave creek .
only once have i had a decent meal .
ate there this morning and they could n't cook my eggs properly .
wo n't be going back there ever again .
the food is edible , but nothing beyond that .
the food is diner food , and frankly , not even good diner food .
the omelette was ok , but nothing special .
slow service , average food , no ambiance .
as a local business owner , i do not recommend this place .
the food is terrible .
bacon looks fake , eggs looks like the kind from mcdonalds .
dont understand why people go to this place .
and our wait for a simple breakfast was unacceptable .
no meat , but i do n't think i missed anything special .
another 5+ minutes go by before he returns to take our meal order .
as my coffee was empty , and sitting at the edge of the booth .
the coffee pot was not empty .
not professional in the least , made me pretty uncomfortable actually .
there was hardly a thank you .
i said no , i 'd like my food .
it started out great , then went downhill very quickly !
very disappointed as we went after reading so many nice reviews .
for $ _num_ per meal at an italian restaurant i expect to be full .
this is hands down the worst italian food in the state .
our experience was horrible .
they tasted like frozen entrees .
the meat was not fresh , the pasta was over cooked by ten minutes .
it was pure mush !
it 's nothing but a cash grab .
it 's weird .
i wish i did n't have to give even one star .
this is the worst food i 've ever had .
pasta not cooked .
pathetic .
is it possible _num_ small pepperoni pizzas to go cost $ _num_ ?
very undercooked awful pizza .
this yelp elite is not impressed .
very disappointed in this locally owned , authentic italian restaurant .
very expensive for the little amount of food you get .
disappointed in the `` to go '' service .
oregano 's around the corner sounds like a better deal and experience .
however , the food was much to be desired .
small portions , the new york strip and arugula was very bland .
the salmon was over cooked and the balsamic glaze was overpowering .
really nice people , really bad overpriced food .
no problem they said .
i was willing to have it repaired and not refunded .
still no response .
guess they 're too lazy to care once a sale is made .
playing my round , the course was in pretty bad shape .
i have never felt like such an inconvenience to staff at a golf course .
i would n't even expect that at a course like orange tree .
not sure what shane s was referring to about management understanding customer service there .
all in all , not worth the drive out there .
it was scary as hell and there was nothing even worth considering buying .
unfortunately for the owners , i will not support bad customer service .
i say , check out buffalo bills just down the road !
hands down the rudest woman i 've ever met was at the counter .
oh well , what goes around , comes around .
_num_ star , because there is n't a lower rating available .
the woman on the phone said _num_ pm .
( i find this hard to believe . )
we jumped out of the car quickly and headed toward the door .
when i said , but it 's _num_ minutes before _num_ .
in summary , i know my watch was not off .
i stopped here on thursday of last week for the first time .
ridiculous .
i said ok and thought no biggie .
she never stopped to speak with me or look me in the eye .
the day this place closes is the day i am throwing a party .
rude !
do not spend a penny here !
horrible customer service ... if i could put zero stars i would .
i was appalled by these miserable people and their customer service .
how rude is that ?
i have not gone back since then .
so sorry we bothered you from reading your book !
so rude !
do n't waste your time .
first off they have the most rude people working there .
a dump with rude staff !
i will go back there for sure , and skip the dump .
overpriced crap from mexico mostly .
not at all what i thought it would be based on the name .
i am unimpressed , will not be back .
my experience at town dump was terrible because of their attitude !
they do n't deserve any buyers !
town dump store deserved this bad bad review .
did i say she was rude ?
i was calling about reservations tomorrow but she did n't want to hear that .
i would not recommend this business , they are rude .
the man who answers the phone is extremely rude .
not a good way to get business .
in the future , i 'll go to another ranch for riding .
the buffalo chip saloon does have wi-fi but it is marginal at best .
_num_ stars for the buffalo chip saloon on their wi-fi .
they have _num_ oz .
i would like to break up my review into two parts .
first , the food- it is not good .
this must have changed owners from the last time that we visited .
i agree device is terrible food worse .
this is all show but the show is not worth it .
worst meal we had in a week at care free .
the brisket was almost pure fat .
to be fair , they took it off our bill .
but they should never have sent it out of the kitchen .
stopped by for lunch , ordered the burger .
second try , we stopped for the all-you-can-eat fish fry on fridays .
sometime it would come out way overcooked and tasting burnt .
food was ok , tried the bbq chicken and the brisket .
both were dry , and the bbq sauce was average at best .
probably will not be back .
food is the worst in cave creek .
took some friends from out of town , they had steak .
the drinks were not even good .
want beer and country music ?
i was hungry , so i 'm probably being generous .
the service is incredibly slow .
we have been sitting here for over _num_ minutes and still no food .
there is zero chance that i will ever come here .
it was so packed people could n't move inside .
there were _num_ lanes of people trying to get in and out .
bottom line , do n't bother .
the food has gone from good to average to awful .
both the mens and ladies restrooms were had toilets overflowing no soap or towels .
the restaurant was hosting a christmas party for their employees .
our group ordered _num_ meals .
the two brisket sandwiches ordered were dry , and not very flavorful .
the two pulled pork sandwiches were almost as bad .
worst breakfast service and worst breakfast food we 've ever had .
nothing was cooked to order ... yuck !
food was average , french fries were cold .
keep in mind we had already rang up a $ _num_ tab .
bad news for us non regulars .
although the servers were friendly , the food was less than desirable .
the worse part was the cheese .
overall , if you like country dancing , playing pool , etc .
the bartender and server looked right at us but never came to our table .
the atmosphere was awesome but the service sucked !
the sad thing is it was sunday and not busy !
looks like it would be a blast on a saturday night .
but our food was very disappointing .
the bottom bun was so wet that the bread was inedible as a sandwich .
my husband had brisket sandwich that he said was less than average .
too bad .
beans were bleh and breaded mushrooms were frozen .
very disappointed .
very busy and they were n't ready for the crowds .
i was there on saturday and will not return if she is there .
that was really lame and i never go there anymore because of it .
i take my money where customer 's are treated well .
we came for lunch and were extremely disappointed !
the onion rings and fries were n't fresh but frozen .
the hamburger had no flavor even with green chili on .
how do you mess up a hamburger ?
the bad - the friday night fish fry is a definite pass .
not seasoned at all .
the ugly - _num_ minutes from being seated to waitress at the table .
_num_ minutes for water .
the food was up _num_ minutes after ordering .
obviously no service training .
skip the food .
this is a review of the restaurant , not the bar area .
seated in the back area where the decor is not very nice .
getting sodas refilled was nearly impossible .
definitely felt like prices were too high for what we got .
i do n't see another visit anytime in the near future .
they saw us standing there for over five minutes and said nothing .
they ignored me .
the people next to us were waiting for drink refills and were livid .
she did n't seem to have an issue with their rudeness .
i can not imagine allowing customers to be treated so poorly .
i was grossed out by how very dusty & dirty everything was .
there were _num_ of us so fortunately they had one more table .
we did n't complain and said we would pay for the chips and salsa .
it is rather bad .
got _num_ cans of beer for $ _num_ .
$ _num_ , you kidding me .
that should be criminal .
no flavor and tough .
very disappointed .
we are both _num_ and got denied access .
ruined our experience and could n't have been more disappointed .
to others it 's nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with bad food .
the food was horrible .
we were starving and just wanted to eat so we found this joint .
i wo n't be back .
this is nothing special in regards to good food .
i do n't even know .
we did n't even get a full pint !
they smelt great , hot and vinegary but the taste was a little bland .
the more i ate , the better they got though .
like i said though , just ok .
they were bbq 'd at least , not boiled like some places .
it was broiled with some onions and some kind of powdered cheese or something .
anyway , skip it .
i 'll miss this one next time i 'm in town .
the chicken noodle soup lacked any substance .
my girlfriend had the chile and commented that said `` shes had better '' .
nor much flavor and the breast meat was dry .
the reuben sandwich lunch was half that .
unfortunately , it 's a totally unknown ( or ignored ) concept here .
this is az people , not nyc !
wish i could rate _num_ stars .
the ribs were dry .
this dessert should have been served with ice cream .
the fried chicken was tasty , but not hot enough .
walked in soaking wet and waited about _num_ min .
a server can just ruin ruin ruin your meal .
awful awful .
it was a little over cooked for med rare .
the food was not great and not bad , just ok .
i had an awful experience here on sunday .
service was bad .
my boyfriend and i went there for dinner last night .
mt boyfriend has been sick since about an hour when we left the restaurant .
unable to leave the bathroom and it 's _num_ pm the next day .
horrible customer service .
decided to try this restaurant as i have never bee there .
very loud and obnoxious to say the least !
we had horrible service .
it was a monday night at 8pm .
drinks : my husband ordered a margarita w/ no salt .
poor planning on them cuz the prickly pear margaritas were on special !
our server did n't even mention the size .
oh , watch out for the skimpy dinner salad , though .
big disappointment .
i pulled her aside and mentioned my frustration .
then she took off the tortillas and gave us dessert .
but service and prices were pretty bad .
the attitude and service provided by our server was subpar at best .
1st and only visit that 's for certain .
wish i could leave _num_ stars .
very few people there ( not a good sign ) .
waited _num_ mins .
_num_ minutes .
service is terrible .
very disappointed .
any chef that serves chicken like that does not deserve to keep his customers .
and , no , i would n't return .
very bland and boring .
my honey had the fish , as i mentioned .
very dark `` old '' atmosphere and dirty feeling .
the food was marginal and over priced .
the service was slow .
disappointing .
had wings , fries and ribs , all not good .
needless to say no desserts were not ordered .
famous fried chicken , how ?
albertsons has the same tasting fried chicken .
way too salty and tasteless .
coleslaw was average at best .
another cave creek tourist trap .
the service was very poor !
margarita was nothing but mix and a splash of tequila .
kfc would have been better .
the cod was just as bad !
avoid if you have taste buds !
boy , were we disappointed !
rack of ribs dry and not much flavor .
fajitas , well do n't order it if you expect real a mexican serving .
lettuce looked like it came out of a bag .
guacamole and sour cream came in little store bought containers .
can remain in business , serving imitation fried chicken , what a total joke !
after reading about their fried chicken ... i want to try it .
it was a thin layer of breading , soaked in grease !
i no longer buy deli fried chicken from local grocery stores .
not waited almost _num_ mins for a seat for _num_ .
my waitress was prompt and , attentive tho .
i know she did n't cook that nasty chicken .
i scheduled an appointment three days out .
do n't call bill , i would not recommend him .
if only zero stars was a possible .
i do n't usually write reviews but this left an extremely negative impression .
a very disappointing experience .
`` is something wrong ? ''
did not listen to what 's was saying what so ever .
his customer service skills did n't even pass to the bare minimum .
& i live in scottsdale .
i 'm glad i wo n't be taking my puppies here !
disgrace !
they did my toes and nails and took me for a fool .
it is n't necessary .
wo n't be back .
they ruined my nail bed .
just a run of the mill subway .
all the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned .
the worst experience at subway .
just disappointing .
the worst experience at subway .
just disappointing .
i paid $ _num_ for interior and exterior and i was so disappointed .
the attention to detail was lacking .
so were they trying to rip me off , or rip and woman off ?
should n't cheat people ... .
talk about bad customer service !
i wo n't be back to this place .
my receipt showed the purchase on it .
that 's when i realized there was no one in the station .
they wo n't get my business anymore .
hh was just down the street from the vacation rental so off i went .
but the pump was going to charge me $ _num_ .
_num_ minutes for both is what he tells me .
nope , i say , just the regular oil .
my kids who are getting the free jeep will not return .
and perhaps a few people who read this review will not visit this location .
but be dishonest with me once and you lose a customer .
wash is even worse than before .
wo n't be back .
terrible terrible stay away .
do not waste your time or money .
the vet tech was trying to run the show and up sell everything .
not sure how they can up charge so much .
but even worse , the tech was very unprofessional .
i just had a bad feeling there and they left me feeling very angry .
will not be back .
i went to a bachelorette party here , a couple weekends ago .
no , just me ?
i am not sure i can really even put my finger on it .
skip it !
i think this is the only way we all could stand the atmosphere .
ridiculous .
the next time we went in it was again on a sunday .
still not busy but this time i was not happy .
it gets worse ... yes , can you imagine ?
this place is just sad .
let me tell you that the experience from top to bottom was horrible !
she was n't kidding .
i had the coconut shrimp , which was overcooked .
another person had the catfish , which was over salted .
he said they were okay but nothing very special .
we all left full , but not satisfied .
once again , nothing special .
overpriced drinks , weird ( not in the good way ) mix of people .
( or men , however you get down ) .
they were terrible but most seemed too drunk or too busy dancing to care .
service was slow , slow , slow .
i tried the nachos and enchiladas .
the nachos were really good but the enchiladas were mediocre .
it seems like it could be a good location to watch football on sunday .
if i 'm invited back on a saturday night , i will pass .
i 've tried this place over the last couple of years .
the drinks are about _num_ % alcohol and _num_ % mix .
wrong .
the fish and chips were miserable .
the drinks , the food , the cleanliness , the wait staff .
a friend suggested meeting here for lunch this week .
everyone had dirty chairs and tables with crumbs , obviously from the night before .
the top three slide off , the bottom one stuck to the table .
she said she 'd never be back .
we went here as a family .
this is not a restaurant ... this is a bar that serves crappy food .
if the service was better maybe this place is a _num_ star .
drinks came , but no menus .
there was no presence of management anywhere ... .
my gf ordered something that looked like it was one big cheesy mess .
sadly , will not be returning .
what a sorry excuse for a restaurant .
the service was slow .
wo n't be back .
not to mention the service is horrible !
had to wait ridiculous amount of time just to be waited on .
their servers are rude and mean .
completely disappointed .
food is not that great , service is poor , weird atmosphere .
pretty dark inside and feels kinda gross .
he was between jobs , but `` squeezed me in '' .
`` you have a big problem . ''
all the fixes were minor and the bill ?
less than $ _num_ .
are you kidding me ?
conclusion : if it all sounds too good to be true , .
we had heat but it was n't heating all the rooms .
excuse me ?
we were the first appt and i had to leave work _num_ hours early .
north valley mechanical : walk away from this family business .
the unit being brand new , all parts are under warranty .
total amount : _num_ ( _num_ already paid ) .
_num_ days later , the problem is coming up again .
this dentist is by far the worst i have ever been to .
too much competition in the area to spend time in an average store .
i tried to give them another chance .
i avoid shopping here .
the produce is n't much fresher .
i have complained to management before and it does n't really do any good .
never acknowledged us , never got off the phone .
plenty of other friendly furniture shops in cave creek to spend our money .
do n't use this dry cleaner !
_num_ ties , a pair of pants and a sports jacket .
i would n't take my dirty socks to this place .
just took car in to have brakes looked at .
$ _num_ bill to replace all the rotors and pads .
the rotors have never been turned before .
she could n't get in touch with me at work and ok 'd it .
douche bags , so i see why the deal is on oil changes .
worst service ever !
not a good place .
i would avoid this repair shop at all costs .
terrible customer service !
horrible !
they took _num_ and a half hours !
i do n't believe in credit cards .
but _num_ hrs was not reasonable !
never going back !
worst experiences ever .
gave this place three tries and way too much money .
if i could give zero stars i would .
there was an air of general confusion and lack of communication .
the car was eventually seen to , and i left unhappy .
i wo n't bother returning .
they even smoke weed in class .
everyone there is either fucking or getting high .
who were disappointed with the staff and company .
would not recommend .
ive never been there before so i didnt know !
and i dont think its fair that he yelled at me .
i probably wont go there again unless i have too .
its too bad because its a cool place .
but i dont appreciate being talked to like that .
mostly a harley place or prepare to get an insult .
_num_ min for a panini melt with sausage ?
only to find a hole in it ?
and to have it replaced with the wrong sandwich ?
if you go inside , expect a wait and frustration .
worst wendy 's i 've been to .
food always seems like it 's been sitting awhile .
bummer since its location is near work .
i have gone there _num_ times in the past month .
the food has been awful .
going back at a different time with different crew did n't help .
i will not be going back to this location .
customer service is not so great either .
the male bartender has major attitude .
he did not even attempt to acknowledge my presence .
my food was sitting in bags on the counter behind him the entire time .
the fish and chips were absolutely disgusting .
the french fries were tasteless and greasy .
very slow to get drink refills .
will likely not return , would rather eat at home .
no , that was rude .
dh ordered the honey chicken sandwich .
dh got a glass of wine , i got ice tea .
the rice was not memorable .
it was not an expensive meal .
my husband tried the mac and cheese and i had the spicy chicken sandwich .
both were bland and unimpressive .
the fries were limp and tasteless .
the food was no different - bland .
i recently went here to check out their lunch offerings .
a bar , grill , patio , and restaurant .
we were all disappointed .
but the cheese was really bland .
i had the mahi mahi tacos and they were just ok .
overall we were disappointed .
i have trained my dog at partners for over _num_ year .
horrible customer service .
when made light of the horrible experience no response .
terrible experience - go elsewhere !
we signed our dog up for rattlesnake training , paid $ _num_ .
ultimately we insisted to come back and did so .
the trainer was rude and our dog was n't trained at all !
please save your money and for the safety of your pup go somewhere else !
why did the ups employee not let me know about this option ?
i will not give this place any more of my business .
if i could , i would like to give these idiots _num_ stars .
that did n't happen .
i called ups back to check on the claim .
$ _num_ to print plain white paper , black ink .
never ever again will i use this location .
ah , nothing .
in addition , my wife ordered a filet without spices .
she can not have any spicy food .
needless to say it came out very peppery .
she sent it back , only to have it brought back very rare .
this was the worst experience i have had ever with a restaurant .
she has such a bad attitude that it kind of brought me down .
she must hate her life .
seriously unhappy with this place , after a year and four months .
no customer service , nothing special about this place .
no good .
extremely rude !
worst storage ever .
worst customer service ever !
if i could i would rate zero stars !
she obviously does n't need the business !
residential area , near a local park .
ca n't beat the location if you love the desert environment .
the horses have no shade .
bad experience and i just do n't feel they treat customers right .
kim , i 'm waiting for three weeks .
i usually just get my food to go from the little window .
... but ... why , oh , why would i go back ?
it seems i need to learn to make my own .
i will not play this course again .
and this was a weekday afternoon , not even a weekend .
why would you even attempt to collect a ridiculous charge like this .
the lady who runs it is beyond rude .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
the guy came and he could barely speak english .
so a few days passes and i hear nothing back .
the guy who answered said he would call me back .
never called back .
no way !
i called and becky was rude as usual .
well , _num_ rolls around and nobody is here .
oh wait probably because most of their employees do n't speak english .
the guy did not show up til noon and he was rude .
this one star is even over rated !
becky , the manager , is a rude liar .
filed a complaint with the bbb and her response was complete lies .
you should not offer store credit when all you do is sell crap .
if you refuse to fix , a full refund is in order .
the credit card charge was more then the bill stated !
_num_ days later someone showed .
_num_ days later man tells me i need a new water heater .
she says her guy was _num_ min away with a new dishwasher .
due to the _num_ warranty running out in _num_ days .
very unprofessional if you sold equipment that work there would be no issue .
my story is similar to rebecca s 's .
their `` repair guy '' is useless !
like i said , useless !
so who 's the dishonest one now sun cities appliances .
not me !
be a better business person or sell your _num_ stores that both are crap .
should have checked yelp before going into this store .
becky said it was a warehouse mistake .
the driver knew what was going on .
has not been refunded yet .
we will file court action next week .
someone must stop what these people are doing .
surely what they are doing is illegal , this is past bad business practices .
spent $ _num_ and my washer still does n't work .
horrible customer service !
i have called them repeatedly and they just give the run around .
please save yourself the problems and go somewhere else .
this place is just shady .
total bait and switch operation .
avoid this place and go anywhere else .
the worst .
greg took it to sun cities appliance to be repaired .
our repair gentleman is never using them again .
i will give them a horrible review any time or anywhere i can .
they did not call , they did not show up .
again no delivery .
avoid this place !
i ca n't believe what horrible service i received .
i asked a few questions and he seemed somewhat confused .
would not recommend coming here .
so gross !
i end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad .
the staff had trouble getting my order correct .
but , i 'm never coming back here again .
as a returning customer , i 'm appalled at such service .
i will not go there again !
rude attitude and lousy customer service !
bad customer service .
$ _num_ burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito .
the first time we stopped in this place was awesome !
very disappointing .
they get an option of get there meals to go , unbelievable !
brunch food is cold , did n't get drinks refilled once .
i have come here every time i 've gone to arizona .
sadly this place blew it on every level .
when we came in we were told it was a _num_ minute wait .
instead we waited _num_ minutes .
i did n't really care because i was hungry .
but i was so excited for the food that i looked past this .
she recognized my grandma and remembered her order .
the waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order .
i ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks .
so when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me .
but this time it took _num_ minutes to get my food .
the tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard .
seriously though , how hard is refried beans and rice .
you ca n't mess that up !
by the end of the night i was drunk , sweaty and hungry .
his was possibly the worst service i have ever gotten in my life .
i have never gotten disrespected so much in a place i was a patron .
you could not pay me to come back here .
this last time thursday evening the food and service were awful .
the meat was tough and tasteless .
we were very disappointed .
we ordered the buffet , the food was not very good and almost cold .
we tried _num_ different dishes and they were so mediocre .
not so much .
until tonight .
not even fresh onion .
it tasted like it sat out for two days before it was cooked .
i couldnt eat past the first couple of bites .
this is ridiculous !
i will not be returning after this experience .
you 've lost two customers due to this .
not restaurant we would recommend .
ca n't say anything about the food , as we were never served .
unacceptable .
`` , no we wanted water as were about to leave .
the responses to questions felt like a forced , almost put off , response .
however , there is always second chance .
unfortunately , not the case .
had to wait _num_ minutes to order and another _num_ minutes for our food .
i would not recommend .
you ca n't get a burro enchilada stable either .
poor service also !
not sure why we returned as we encountered many problems .
on one occasion one of our group did not touch his entree after tasting .
other diners that night had just barely ok fare .
this waiter continued to be downright rude several times !
it was monday night and margaritas are only a dollar .
now i know it was salted on rocks but this was pretty bad .
not all that impressed .
high prices and not a lot of options .
also , everything i asked the waiter about was `` hot . ''
i got the chicken fajitas and they were not good .
it seriously tasted like how my garbage smells .
it was gross .
they just seemed over busy and understaffed .
that 's not the waiter 's fault .
even though the chips and salsa were great , i will not be back .
the price is way too high for what you get .
the food returned hot , hot lettuce , hot tomatoes , pretty half ass .
was served cold tamales .
they reheated it and served it again .
rice was hard & crispy .
_num_ of us had dinner , everything ordered was bland and uninspired .
oh , and one of us got severe food poisoning .
all i can say was i am very disappointed .
the food off the buffet was just as bland !
the sauce on my eggs was not spicy it was more watering .
she would take so long to come back to bring our drinks .
the food was n't as i expected .
gross food .
not authentic mexican food at all .
i did n't like it one bit .
and the chips had a very weird dust taste to them .
this is the worst walgreens i have ever been to .
i ca n't .
some one needs to figure out what 's going on at this pharmacy .
every time we order from here something is wrong .
pizza is cold .
get your crap together !
not anymore !
walked in to an empty dominos .
the worker asked me for a minute which was n't an issue .
i waited almost _num_ minutes until i realized she was gone .
upset i went to the counter again .
my pizza was n't getting hotter on the cooling rack .
i hate this location .
however , if you are vegetarian , skip it .
the only thing on the menu i could order was a very greasy quesadilla .
it took over a week to get mine vacuumed properly !
i wish again they had a zero star on yelp for this place !
my parents are n't the adventurous type .
anyway i went into the diner with low expectations .
the bed was clean and the room appeared clean .
was just an ok place , ac did not work well in the room .
the temp was _num_ degrees on our arrival .
this is not the cleanest location but again just okay .
worst customer service ever .
the gas station cashier was also super rude .
would 've given them no stars .
stopped here after car breaking down at 2am .
walked a mile to this place and was grateful they were still open .
the sheets were stained and dirty , hair on the pillows .
air conditioner could not cool the room down , found a cockroach .
disgusting place .
we walked the half mile to the best western and were much happier .
cheap , rundown , dirty , but cheap .
this place is a ripoff .
got a `` discount '' rate of $ _num_ per night plus tax .
this motel was worth $ _num_ per night , including tax .
shower was lukewarm water .
dingy little single towel .
foam mattress ( hence , back pain after sleeping for _num_ hours ) .
not the worst hotel i 've stayed in , but perhaps bottom _num_ .
hotel staff were very friendly , though !
place looks questionable , even though the place looks packed .
no outlets to charge phone .
shower went from full blast to just dripping .
when you turn the light switch off all the appliances also turns off .
i thought that $ _num_ was a bargain .
the walls were filthy , the bathroom was worse .
the paint is peeling off every wall .
showers were an extra $ _num_ a day which seemed kinda steep .
$ _num_ per sites maybe .
they do n't have teeth !
year four and now they are no more .
the club sandwich looked very homemade ; i.e .
do n't why this place has good reviews .
the place has waaaay over-priced generic food .
i think nothing of it , and finish my biscuits and gravy .
i drift into sleep .
it 's two or three years later and i still remember the horror .
avoid at all costs because this places is disgusting .
_num_ full tables out of _num_ is like a rush for you ?
food is just ok , nothing to write home about .
probably the worst place i have ever walked into .
horrible .
order something like a fried egg if you go here .
do n't accept anything they call `` vegetables . ''
unfortunately i do n't think there are many other options in the area .
on the negative side , the help left a huge amount to be desired .
the waitress provided a bill and disappeared into the kitchen .
we said thanks for nothing as we walked out the door .
but we gave the place a chance .
obviously , having barely opened the menu , we nicely asked for a minute .
redeeming food service was quickly found at burger king , just up the road .
do n't waste your time at space age !
simple breakfast order took over _num_ minutes .
and i mean , `` let it go '' , frozen .
it 's only saving grace was the pickles , of which i used generously .
someone else will have to review the food , because we left .
that is its only redeeming quality .
yep , it is a restroom stop .
it will be slow .
horrible freezer foods warmed up .
no sauce but brought little mayo packets !
wo n't go back .
also slow service with restaurant barely full .
she asked what i wanted ?
it was ok , better than mcdonalds but it lacked flavor .
after waiting _num_ minutes i walked out .
i wish i had that hour of my life back .
terrible service !
waitresses with nasty attitudes !
when i asked if there was more coffee , she got an attitude .
i wish i could give no or negative stars .
i have never been served straight up frozen food like this before .
apparently there is new management who only cares about cost .
poor service , long wait times , wrong orders when food finally arrives .
avoid this place for food .
but do use as a toilet pit stop .
clean bathrooms are the only redeeming feature .
the service was horrible and the prices were sky high .
the service was extremely poor !
this is not a good place to eat .
the food was not good .
too much meat in the burritos and burned rice .
the water had an after taste and did not seem to be filtered .
terrible service and food .
stopped for breakfast and the omelet i received was inedible .
sent it back and ordered a different one which was not much better .
no thanks i just want to get out of here and never come back !
next time i 'll stop at circle k for a pack of almonds .
i wish we had stopped at mcdonalds or just about anywhere else instead .
seriously , there are like two other restaurants within a few blocks .
they really could n't be any worse .
in our opinion , you should avoid this fast food stop at all costs !
horrible service !
it deserves less than a star on multiple levels .
i was craving some flautas and went there for some .
flautas are the easiest thing to make and it was a major disappointment .
a mexican restaurant that puts out this type of quick fix doesnt take pride .
we wo n't bother again .
very bland boring food .
slow service , brought my partners meal _num_ minutes before mine .
no alcohol .
first off , the address is incorrect !
bad food , bad service , takes too much time .
bad food .
bad service .
i had a veggie burrito which was really bad .
my husband had a fish burrito which he could not even taste the fish .
what a disappointment !
bingo lies and false advertising !
normally on a sunday about _num_ % of the hall is full .
all machines sold out and everyone is pissed off .
management of the bingo and casino both said oops computer mistake .
this place is a rip off .
the reason they never called was there was a storm and they were busy .
yes ... ladies ... too busy .
is my money and broken window not good enough ?
i took time off of work and was ready to get this install completed .
that was three weeks ago and no phone call .
wasting time with the wrong glass company is just time wasted .
do not pay until you carefully inspect all of their work .
just a very sloppy , unprofessional job .
they did not install the replacement properly and it broke the same day .
after over a year had passed i asked them to refund our money .
do not use this company , they are liars and thieves !
for at least few days , till i get the new unit .
sadly , he could n't .
and then i called another company , ocean breeze air .
the bill was for about $ _num_ .
they really messed things up .
an inflated price ?
or are they just not that good ?
this was to prevent an additional service call in the near future .
to sum things up , taking my car here was a terrible choice .
my car never had this problem until i picked it up from this place .
took it back to them and told them i never had this problem .
it 's not a piece that would break just because .
never had such a bad experience like this before .
my car went from bad to worst .
no thanks .
this clinic is under staffed and the wait is long .
after _num_ minutes and _num_ seconds on hold they hung up .
so not even trying to call back .
i had the worst dental experience here .
it was so embarrassing .
no shit !
because he did n't check properly !
since then he has lost a tooth and is n't eating normally .
poor guy !
these are my babies and i will not tolerate anyone being so careless !
shame on you !
walking in , this salon is dirty .
this is by far the worst hair salon i have ever been in .
i did n't know that not paying was an option .
i never called her back because i was pissed that she hung up .
the stylist could not believe what she was seeing .
wow , how bad is bad !
is there no such thing in this area at all .
recently i gave up meat and consider myself a vegetarian .
that is pretty careless .
service was ok and food was n't any better .
just tofu , juice , and chips .
no sour , no spice .
now for the kung pao _num_ , that was the only entree we liked .
other than that , i was not to pleased .
when the food arrived , i saw why they suggested to change my order .
the food was not even hot , it was barely warm .
my broccoli chicken was chewy .
it was cold as well .
big mistake .
she said she could n't do that .
_num_ dollars for tofu .
at the _num_ minute mark we left , and will never return again .
the only good thing they have is their crunchy noodle and egg rolls .
everything else is lacking seasoning , and flavor .
no sign of the awesome manager that was working before .
if i could give them zero stars , i would !
horrible service , no sense of urgency and no sense to even say sorry !
took me about _num_ minutes just to get fries and a drink .
this is the 2nd most horrible place in peoria to eat .
they never get the food right , they do n't speak english .
no stars for food quality .
fries were n't the freshest .
employees does n't understand english .
ordered zucchini and i got _num_ pieces in half of a small fries container .
this particular pizza hut is the worst one we 've ever ordered from !
they always mess up our orders , either delivery or carry out !
very very slow delivery .
not a happy customer at all .
we love the pizza but the service is quite lacking .
never got an email saying there was a problem .
foods always cold .
just got home from our sonic run ... and boy , did it suck .
his dog was left naked and soggy .
the food service isnt even prompt like other fast food joints .
this fast food restaurant is really disappointing .
complete waste of time , gas , and energy .
_num_ out of _num_ were wrong and pillows were back ordered .
pillows came in , i asked to hold them .
after an hour of shopping self checkout was the only thing open .
i left my cart & said i dont need to shop here .
i 've never felt ripped off by their service until today .
the installation cost of the door was $ _num_ .
purchase doors here but do not let them do the installation .
he had a copy of the original order .
the counter top company says it was home depot 's mistake .

_num_ days later i called home depot they contacted the counter top company .
i could have ordered it on amazon prime and had it in two days .
there pizza is good , but terrible reheated .
there wings are the worst i 've ever had .
we spend plenty of money there and tip much more than necessary .
i have been going here for a few years .
however , when we showed more interest , they did , too .
i talked them up ... always told people how they cut my hair right .
on top of that ... the girl said not a word .
but it was terrible .
not cool ... and jessica is never going back .
so i went home that night and searched for my receipt .
it 's just as bad as great clips but more pricey !
i do n't even want to go back and get it fixed .
i understand appointments but learn customer service and try saying hello .
with no greeting .
this church 's chicken restaurant has been closed for over a year !
save yourself some cash and get frys deli fried chicken .
this dentist is a scam artist who does n't deserve one star .
i agree with the comments about the receptionist - rude and unhelpful .
i was scared to go back and tried _num_ other dentists a year after .
to my relief , the new dentists said i had no cavities !
do not go to this dentist !
i replied that is the same area i just pointed out to him .
either wait until a week day to see your regular dentist or go elsewhere !
dental work was okay but they never filed my claim with my insurance .
called again and got the same empty words .
that was january and this is august .
they are very unprofessional and complain too much .
i have n't even seen dental students complain like this .
opened the hood the oil cap was left off .
i can see why this place only has one star .
rude .
they only seem to cater to white women as another reviewer stated .
i came with _num_ people and my _num_ year old daughter to bowl .
it 's not like we would n't pay for both lanes .
he told us that other lanes were reserved , which is the biggest bs .
there were _num_ other lanes open .
the `` _num_ other people '' that he said reserved lanes never showed up .
we received a very bad customer service from the manager for an unknown reason .
worst experience ever !
the gm bob does n't care about the customers at all .
this alley is the worst alley ever .

many other people are having same problems !

sorry no other way to honestly describe it .
i will not return here unless there is a different bartender .
they lost our business permanently .
my life is very boring and at a slow point at the moment .
the kid that was supposed to help me did n't show up .
oh , and rarely did n't anyone make eye contact with me .
the store was n't that busy at all .
but still a good store , just had a bit of an annoying experience .
stay away from this home depot if you need help .
and they would fix it for $ _num_ .
no offer to make this right , nothing .
horrible service !
wish i could give `` _num_ '' stars for this home depot .
avoid this home depot at all costs !
horrible !
this store is a big disappointment .
i met with a carpet representative and paid for a measure .
neither of these requirements were mentioned by the sales person .
very unhappy former customer .
it took an hour to start making steam and then it was weak .
goodbye home depot , hello lowes .
needless to say , i wo n't be back to this location .
every customer counts even _num_ minutes before closing as profit pays your paycheck .
waited another _num_ minutes or so and still nobody showed up .
i see so many _num_ and _num_ stars .
i have been going here off and on for about _num_ years .
they used to be _num_ but just two weeks ago they jumped to _num_ .

terrible place .
very irritating , wo n't be returning .
just walked out of this place with my family .
one server looked me right in the eye then turned and walked away .
there were _num_ or _num_ regulars sitting at the bar .
did not feel welcomed or appreciated ... never going back .
if i could not give this place a star , i would .
we then waited _num_ minutes for her drink .
i said no , just take it off the bill please .
he did n't even acknowledge me , just turned and walked away .
another _num_ minutes passed and he finally checked on us .
she 's rude , demanding n is plain nasty .
she ruins the appetite !
i also wrote the corporate office and did not receive a reply .
i guess they just do n't .
i see there are other very poor reviews .
this place used to be good but then something changed .
food service is slow .
_num_ minutes for an order of sliders and potato salad .
only ten customers in here at the moment .
not a place to have lunch on a schedule !
he 'd say something then someone from the back said something too .
confusing !
i have not been to kfc in years .
i had to wait for about _num_ minutes for my wedges to cook .
i immediately called hoping that they would realize their error .
they were flat , dry and bland .
the chicken fingers were also bland .
what a huge disappointment !
the other store would be just _num_ minutes away .
well , the other store was over _num_ miles away , in surprise .
no more kfc for me !
i would never eat there again after this visit .
hubby and i stopped in for ice cream after getting back from wickenburg .

however , sonic 's is cheaper , and mcdonald 's is even cheaper .
the `` kids '' behind the counter had no clue what they were doing .
customer no service .
no customer service .
this place has made me hate dairy queen .
the customer service is terrible .
and my chicken tenders were cold and disgusting .
communication with the owner in my experience was poor .
these issues were eventually corrected , but again , this is a communication problem .
and when they repeated the order back they got it wrong .
would not come back here again .
everyone spoke spanish no one spoke english really sucks .
i went here late one night at about 3am .
first of all , employees should not be out smoking on shift .
gross !
it was rude and disgusting !
this jack in the box has made me sick on a few occasions .
i 'm thinking what ?
why ca n't you just substitute the curly for normal .
terrible customer service !
we walked in at _num_ am .
we walked out .
no organization at all !
this place is a rip off .
this place will never get my business .
third time is not the charm .
the first time i went to this place i got the oil done .
took them nearly _num_ hours even though i was the 3rd person there .
then they could n't find my keys .
took them nearly _num_ minutes to find them .
last time i went , i wanted to get the oil done .
already a bit irritated , i asked if the car was done .
he told me it would only be another _num_ minutes before it was done .
he did n't even apologize .
walmart has better customer care policies than this place .
they do not have equipment to do a proper test .
this time i had an alternator quit and removed .
did not charge .
took it back they tested said nothing wrong with alternator .
it did not charge .
pep boys refuses to help me with the matter .
oh and there is no one else in the store except me .
i did after two trips to the store get my money back .
i gave them one star as you ca n't give _num_ .
they quoted $ _num_ to have my radiator replaced .
and that 's assuming my radiator even needs replacing .
avoid !
i 've always done my own oil changes but not this one .
they could n't even put the oil filter back in tight enough .
my father in law went to have his tire pressure checked .
my story is that i went to there to get an alignment .
i will not come back here again .
they lost my business for good !
if you need parts or work done i 'd recommend you go elsewhere .
so math is n't a strong point either for the staff .
i ca n't afford this amount so i go pick up my car .
this place is awful !
bad customer service .
every time i go to pep boys i leave very disappointed .
the people are lacking any social skills and customer service .
i will definitely check the oil next time i 'm in the car .
terrible service .
slow and not very helpful .
terrible visit this time .
long wait and food was way over cooked .
to top it off restaurant was a mess .
the `` stuff '' inside there was disgusting .
all in all , you get what you pay for .
everytime i come they are out of several things .
the service is slow and poor .
way over priced for subpar .
i ordered simple chicken fingers and they tasted like they were microwaved .
waitress never even came to check on drinks till after our meals were complete .
the food was mediocre .
i ordered a salad and she like tossed my plate down .
i went to rent a carpet cleaner this morning .
we walk in and a friendly petsmart employee asked how it was .
we still had _num_ minutes before the store closed .
we are extremely disappointed to see other customers get help and we were ignored .
however , my problem was with the staff .
hmm ... only if i can get service from this assistant manager .
unacceptable !
i 've never been to a place with such horrible customer service .
i wish i had read the reviews before going in to this place .
i 've never disliked a business so much as this one .
it makes me so mad just talking about this place .
they steal your money and have horrible customer service .
when i made myself known there was no smile , no common courtesy .
did n't take my name .
the staff looked like they were going to a backyard barbecue .
this year , i have had three pairs of glasses from these idiots .
all three have been wrong .
my glasses are that bad .
went there a couple days ago , through the drive-thru .
what a mistake .
i ca n't believe they would even serve that sort of food to customers .
i will never go back to this location , i 'd rather go hungry .
do n't waste your time or money .
was n't going to drive back just tossed it .
the frys were cold and greasy .
a waste of _num_ bucks .
i ordered _num_ beef tacos at $ _num_ each .
such as taco sauce , sour cream or guacamole .
next was a beef burrito served up in a stale , flavorless flour tortilla .
if i could give a negative star rating , i surely would !
there food just does n't have much flavor .
they messed up my order and then asked me to come back .
i was already pissed cause the food gets cold instantly .
when i walked in , i was immediately greeted with a cheery `` hello !
they are rude and dirty .
guac was decent but nothing was worth coming back for .
i went there with a large group of people ( _num_ in all ) .
i did n't eat dinner .
no particular reason why .
they no longer sold that beer .
nope , did n't have that either .
server brought out chips & salsa .
horrible !
the service was horrible and the food was cold and disgusting .
but here 's the thing ... the food is disgusting .
they give you free stale chips and salsa .
in our group we had ordered tortas , camarones rancheros , and fish .
tasted like absolutely nothing .
the camarones rancheros were the absolute worst .
the situation was almost laughable because they were so bad .
the rice and beans that came with it were n't good either .
gross .
never ever going back .
usually i 'm not dissatisfied with this place .
but i ate here saturday night and _num_ large parties came in after us .
the quesadilla lacked cheese it was pretty pathetic and tasteless .
our appetizer was queso fundido with chorizo it was cold and stringy .
i think its sad that they did n't treat all their tables with priority .
i will never return again .
it to forget how uncomfortable she made me feel .
needles to say we wo n't be back .
i will not be back to eat here .
i took one bite of this fish and it literally tasted like dirt .
it was horrible .
not just any cat fish !
i paid $ _num_ and i hate my hair ... .
a few nights later , i discovered that you could design the shirt online .
she called me back three days later and spoke with me about everything .
my walk was _num_ days away at this point and i started to panic .
thanks for the false pricing , target .
i 'm going to think twice before i go back to target .
not worth the _num_ % discount to get overcharged .
so the skinny on the _num_ star review .
we do n't know who you talked to and there 's nothing here .
i am extremely disappointed with this specific target .
this is ridiculous .
not like other target stores .
ok , then why did n't you guys clean it ?
they literally destroyed all of this at my house .
save yourself time , money , and the headache and use a different company .
first experience was an appointment for an exam .
i was there for _num_ hours .
started off okay but could n't get the tooth out .
they took the x-rays they needed after the failed attempt .
their ill prepared attempt basically wasted time and money .
needless to say all this has me pretty frustrated .
the person i talked to on the phone was extremely rude .
this guy is a poor excuse for a human being .
we experienced a situation where we smelled propane all throughout the house .
i do not recommend this company .
they failed to deliver _num_ of the _num_ combos we ordered .
it also took them _num_ minutes longer to deliver than promised .
terrible service .
gross restroom !
-the cashier was condescending .
( i thought we were in a bad economy ?
the store was a disaster .
crap all over the floors , stuff not in the right places .
so many devil children running around literally screaming , running into me ect .
unfortunately , after having the bedding for a month , it is falling apart .
i would recommend not buying a bed in a bag here .
this place sells mostly dollar store quality products , not what i was expecting .
poor quality on their bedding .
it was horrible and i returned them both .
never settle for less cuz your in a hurry .
first she denied that i sat at the pedicure station .
then she said that i should have kept my nails facing down .
my bf and i went to this deal taco location on friday .
within _num_ hours of eating both of us had food poisoning !
carry out is a nightmare .
this has happened to me more than once and it is very irritating .
besides the food being poor the guests that were here were even worse .
pizza taste like cardboard and games are horrible .
the prizes are just crappy as they get .
no table cloth no balloons no person to take our order .
i was very disappointed .
i was so disappointed that i will never have a party here again .
not happy at all , plus the manager was a jerk that night .
thx for making my daughters 1st birthday unforgettable in a bad way !
very dirty place floors looked horrible tables were nasty .
pretty sad when customer had to clean off the tables themselves .
i ordered wings with my pizza and pizza came out wings were n't ready .
horrible horrible customer service .
poor toy counter girl was the only one up there with _num_ kids waiting .
plus she had no clue what kids were standing there .
_num_ mins later we were helped .
i would n't recommend this peter piper ever .
_num_ pizzas and _num_ wings .
they apologized and said the wings and the other pizza were not done yet .
horrible service .
wings were cold and we still waiting for the second pizza .
maybe this is like one of those training centers for their employees .
this place was terrible !
the place was super dirty , half eaten pieces of pizza on the games .
the bathrooms were dirty , there were no paper towels .
i will not be coming back here .
i will not be returning to this location .
the place opens at 11:00 .
very disappointing .
i gave two stars only because the items were hot when i receive them .
it 's always so slow !
the person behind me had not pulled forward .
omg i would have paid the difference for nicer service that 's for sure .
two stars for this location , ultimately because of the poor customer service .
overall , it was just a weird and awkward experience .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
worst taco bell experience ever !
i never go to this location and i wo n't again .
i used the mobile app to order almost $ _num_ in food .
i received a confirmation email and my card was charged like normal .
they completely ignored me .
they did n't get eaten .
rude , inconsiderate , incompetent staff .
-- this comment left me absolutely disgusted , stunned and pretty much speechless .
he really needs to learn to be professional .
terribly overpriced you would be wise to shop around .
strongly do not recommend this place .
he said no that he has handled much more valuable .
bad service and the guy could careless to even be working .
the food was n't anything to brag or complain about .
everything on the menu is accompanied by either white or egg fried rice .
this place is the worst !
about _num_ minutes later no delivery .
no one was there the were gone like ghost .
the food never showed up , never received a phone call or any communication .
it is now late my family is starving and china place stole my money .
no answer at the place i am very upset and could use some help .
if i could i would give this place negative rating .
please help shut this place down and force them into financial ruin .
ugh .
if i could rate less than one star i would .
i ordered pork fried rice with no veggies and add egg .
horrible customer service .
_num_ pints of white rice and some weird looking chicken stir fry .
and she told me i was wrong .
worst customer service ever .
most disappointing meal i 've eaten in well over a year .
i do n't hold chinese delivery places to that high of a standard .
wonton soup broth must have been pure water .
everything in it was flavorless .
fried rice was even awful .
horrible service !
horrible horrible service !
and these are the only two positive things about the whole experience .
hot and sour soup - very sour .
none hot .
sadly disappointed .
chinese food does n't have to be rocket science .
will not be returning .
sad thing is that used to be my favorite place .
egg roll was just ok .
gave me some free crab puffs for the inconvenience .
he finally accepted fault as he felt against the corner .
also , it was a bit pricey $ $ $ .
the _num_ stars are for dine in and the _num_ stars are for delivery .
the food i received was tasteless and my lo mein had no sauce .
the broccoli and beef that did have a `` sauce '' was still tasteless .
pricey too , i was not happy .
big mistake on the new menu and the prices are too high .
we went in this past friday , july _num_ , _num_ .
not only was the food bad , it was just dirty .
very disappointing .
sat at our table for _num_ minutes and had n't even got greeted .
at that point we were starving and did n't even bother going back in .
possibly from being microwaved or maybe from being freezer burnt .
it goes like this .
the cocktail sauce was n't the same tartar sauce either .
sad to say this my last visit .
first off , i would like to say that the food is always good .
do n't bother ... and make sure you do n't go there at night .
will not be back .
i 've never had a good experience here .
i am never coming back here again .
this is a terrible mcdonalds !
service sucks , and management is worse !
horrible customer service .
ok so wow i will not be coming back to this bar .
it was sick !
we quickly drank our beers finished the one game and left .
one of the absolute worst experiences i have ever had at a bar .
charged _num_ effing dollars on soda !
we will all be calling the better business bureau to report the poor service .
please do not waste your time with this place !
terrible customer service .
( this was _num_ hours after i ordered . )
the lady did not understand my frustration and disappointment and was extremely rude .
they also should n't be rude to customer when they make mistakes .
do not recommend .
the ordering service via phone was less than stellar .
it was also ordered with other flowers so there was n't a shipping charge .
the photo i got was what caused the _num_ star review .
i give a second chance ... never again .
oh this shop ripped me off good !
i asked why because that was not what she quoted me over the phone .
honestly , it was a little strange , really like , nothing .
yep , never again .
the first time i went here i would have given this place _num_ stars .
this time it seemed pretty bland .
not that great .
i got the sesame chicken lunch combo and totally regret it .
the egg roll tasted like it was previously frozen & lacked flavor .
the chicken was way too salty and the rice was edible but nothing special .
if i could give this less than a star a would .
it was disgusting .
the rice is now more like spanish rice instead of fried rice .
when buying an established restaurant do n't you get the recipes ?
i for one can not except the change .
new owners do n't have a clue on how to run a restaurant .
the egg drop soup was egg drop gravy .
they also removed the veggies from here .
and no more fountain drinks .
under the new management it should be called bye bye china .
this place was new on grub hub so i wanted to try it out .
it appears that the restaurant only places the very basics of the order .
this place is too shady and i will not be ordering from them again .
i called tho see if he would warranty it and he said no .
actual install time _num_ minutes .
do not use this place .
he blatantly lied to me .
why not just replace it now ?
there was only one guy helping customers .
i left irritated and grumpy .
it 's pretty busy all the time .
nothing special .
surprisingly , the only place we found that had karaoke on a saturday night .
karaoke used to be on every corner but i guess not anymore .
meanwhile , we kept seeing the same people over and over again .
shame on us for giving them a second chance .
between this and the bartender over charging us , we are never going back .
experience was bad from the get go .
bartender did n't know our drink .
place is small and dirty , and was really uncomfortable to us .
their loss , not ours .
it makes no sense .
went there saturday night after i have gone to another party .
i have been to enough places and your song usually gets played .
needless to say , i will never go back there .
i do n't get it .
if you love karaoke , avoid this place .
we can leave this place to the regulars .
unfortunately , i was n't very pleased with most aspects of my order .
ugh .
so now i have pink rocks which i did n't want at all .
price for just under $ _num_ .
after he decided to help me he was very rude and disrespectful to me .
after he decided to help me he was very rude and disrespectful to me .
this is from the owner who is listed as robert on yelp .
i wanted to let you know that we take reviews like this very seriously .
if you do n't mind , we 'd like to make this right .
why would i come back after being treated poorly ?
i just want to let everyone know how you treated me !
only problem is they lie about how long it will take .
i went to discount tire after there was a crack in my rim .
not going there again .
they will not stand by their products .
i have never grabbed a cart and not had a sticking or bad wheel .
december _num_ , _num_ .
`` our registers are off .
they literally just shrugged at me .
horrible customer service !
would not recommend .
the food was sub par and not that reasonable $ $ .
service was okay but joseph is just rude .
does not seem to care if he has repeat customers .
do n't understand the previous reviews .
not our experience .
me and my boyfriend went here to try out something new for dinner .
the burger was n't the best and the flavor was bland .
it just plain sucks !
very , very , very drab and outdated .
waitress was rude .
got burnt waffles and she shook her head as if it was my fault .
will not be coming back here .
horrible .
the bacon was definitely sitting .
it came out tough and cold .
not worth the money or another visit .
however , calling those greens `` greens '' is a stretch .
they are so slow it is ridiculous .
greens that slow hurt your game for other courses .
worst golf experience ever !
do n't visit this place if you want a good golf experience .
the starter was a jerk .
with the exception of hole _num_ , the front _num_ was in atrocious condition .
i 've never seen anything like it .
furthermore , the cart paths - drive at your own risk .
i do n't really see myself coming back to play .
i was quoted $ _num_ for delivery .
i explained that i 'd been quoted $ _num_ but was charged $ _num_ .
- it should be $ _num_ .
walgreens is the go-to place for cards .
the only item on the menu still good is the mexican pizza .
chocolate cream , peanut butter , coconut cream , etc .
believe me , you wo n't find better pie anywhere !
thanks , but no thanks .
my boyfriend got _num_ eggs over medium with biscuits and gravy .
i mean , should n't there be eggs in an egg scramble ?
not bad but not good either , just ok .
i think i will not return as there are better in the area .
i was here friday may 9th _num_ .
the bathroom was gross dirty and smelled terrible !
_num_ minutes go by and no one has check on us .
when the waitress brought me my salad i though it was a joke .
gross gross gross !
the lettuce was wilted and the tomato looked freeze dried .
god i still ca n't believe it !
my salmon was dry and bland !
nothing real bad just not something homemade .
there was a charge for my friends fries .
who the hell sells a hamburger a la carte ?
so over all we were not impressed with any of it !
the service was great but the food was horrible .
the chicken sandwich was plain .
two potato wedges .
terrible , unfriendly service .
never got my drink refilled or asked how my meal was .
i will never go to this restaurant again .
he dropped me so fast , it was unbelievable .
i then realized that the salesmen , are just that , salesman .
i was just frustrated with this experience because of how i was treated .
to bad they are n't diligent in their jobs .
my friends had numerous problems with their rentals as well .
the staff does n't care and leaves you standing around waiting for help .
i would not recommend them for a tux rental .
every single tux for my wedding party was the wrong size .
my husband 's tux pants were about _num_ inches too short .
shirts were wrong , jackets were wrong .
a dress shirt on sale for $ _num_ ?
shoes for $ _num_ ?
will not be back , if at all possible .
even when i left no one said a word to me .
this made it difficult for every single person who went in .
we were not going to let this experience ruin our day .
however , i would not recommend this facility to anyone .
their customer service was the worst i 've seen in a long time .
came back _num_ week to the day to pick it up .
$ _num_ out .
$ _num_ for repair and no bag .
do not trade shoe repair or anything with these people .
you might not get it back .
and they do n't care if they go to small claims court .
this place is a total joke .
do not waste your time or money here !
i will never return , nor recommend this ghetto excuse for a cobbler .
i had a client 's husband pass away so i called for flower service .
rude and immediately got the wrong feeling .
this store stinks !
once is oops , twice is simply poor management .
what good is an asian salad without any dressing ?
the clerk was rude and did n't care less .
i will not go to this wendy 's ever again !
next time i want wendy 's i will drive further to a different store .
most wendy 's in general are usually _num_ or _num_ stars .
this store gets zero stars , but yelp wo n't let me enter zero .
plus the beer was over priced .
i was so disappointed !
to me , that 's not a good sign .
i would not recommend eating at the peoria cafe .
i ordered two pancakes and bacon for my breakfast .
disgusting !
i dined at this restaurant for the friday fish fry .
my problem was with the staff .
they were not pleasant to us .
my biscuit was dry and very , very dense .
my daughter got the breakfast burrito and said it was o.k .
eggs are bad other food is pretty good .
seats are comfortable and no real complaints .
but for the most part the food is bad .
breakfast food is just ok , it is not very flavorful .
the service is very slow and not nice .
im sad to say that i was dissapointed with the fish fry .
really need to slow down and cook the food better .
never washed her hands after eating .
the eggs and rye toast were fine .
the bacon was thin and limp .
it was like they were steamed rather than fried .
the food was horrendous and i rarely say that about a place .
i got sick after eating here .
a little hard to find the place .
i will try again for lunch and update my review .
corned beef hash and home fries mushy .
english muffin a shade below warm .
it was not a short incline by any means .
map online was very misleading .
i was disappointed .
well , the playground was gone .
the picture of our site was completely deceiving , check out space _num_ .
prices were really reasonable for boat rentals .
the highest price was $ _num_ for a _num_ foot power boat .
horrible customer service !
huge line of customers , all the employees are too busy to help them !
no respect for your customers !
_num_ of us ordered the gyros salad .
gyro meat , lettuce , onions , _num_ tomato slice and sauce .
unfortunately for us , apparently it was hard to do .
and the gyros meat had been on the spit a little too long .
the meat really had no taste to it either .
i wo n't be back .
and from the looks of it , neither will many others .
i have never ordered a chicken gyro and received something so disgusting .
there was no way it was going in my mouth .
it was still awful .
the tzatziki sauce was so bland it could have been water .
the pita itself was nothing special .
and the water from the soda fountain dispenser tasted worse than tap .
except they technically `` stole '' my desk !
nothing special about the place .
staff is friendly but nothing more than any other business .
just your average sun city used furniture .
these women treated my mother horribly .
nasty attitudes .
i was stunned .
another man , also waiting , same story .
lots of pissed of people in the waiting room .
the scheduling here is a nightmare .
the procedure involved _num_ hours waiting in the reception area and finally surgery .
second trip in , _num_ hours waiting again !
all i can say is that i am glad he only has _num_ eyes .
worst service ever !
staff is very rude .
and they do n't really care about their patients .
we have been here for _num_ hours and still not been called .
very rude receptionist and nothing to keep patients from staring at walls .
terrible !
long lines are the norm .
safeway does not price match and i even called the district office .
crap attitude at this store .
do n't have any expectations while going to this expensive store .
we want our old safeway back !
was not very impressed .
i 've been here _num_ times .
i give taste a _num_ out of _num_ .
first i want to say that i have not eaten at this bakery .
noticed employees were a little surly as we ordered our goodies .
went to coffee area and _num_ of the four pots were empty .
i 'm confused by these great reviews .
and , when we got home the cupcakes were old and dry .
but , their customer service is lacking and so is their food .
mostly all of their items are old and dirty .
the place smells sooooooo bad .
the person working said no because we are closing .
ask yourself , is this a company i want to do business with ?
and still would n't do the right thing .
then the manager , jimmy , was disrespectful .
also , their prices are getting outrageous .
she also burned me with the hot wax .
needless to say i will not return nor recommend .
restaurant was filthy , restrooms worse than filthy .
still ended up sick as dog .
do not eat here under any circumstances .
finally found a buffet worse than city buffet .
i could n't finish anything i tried .
gross .
even the rice was overcooked .
my fiance and i refused to pay but offered to pay for our soda .
will not be returning to this establishment .
however , the food was terrible .
nothing was hot enough and the quality was poor .
i ate some of the food and am now feeling sick .
none of us will ever be back .
this place was not it for sure .
their food selection was poor , almost everything was fried .
the place looked run down and lightning was horrible .
we will never return to king buffet .
when i walked in it look like any other buffet place , ok .
the basics ( orange chicken , beef and broccoli ) were okay .
sushi bar looked weird .
the interior is old and worn .
wait staff wore dirty clothes .
horrible !
$ _num_ for crap !
not worth the money you pay .
bathrooms are so disgusting i was scared to us it .
felt like i was walking on _num_ years worth of spilled soda .
my visit did n't start out good .
i guess the waitress did n't know english .
that 's not what you want when you go to a buffet .
this place deserves to be shut down .
not worth the money you pay .
bathrooms are so disgusting i was scared to us it .
is this a daycare or car rental service ?
not very professional .
my insurance company , state farm , has a contract with hertz .
another _num_ minutes trying to get that error fixed .
my car is still not ready at the shop .
it has been _num_ minutes and still no contact .
never use this office .
customer service is horrible .
when a person answers they are so rude .
i did not get a car from this location .
i do n't even want to give them _num_ star !
horrible location .
the owner does not honor employee promises .
long story short , owner refused to honor this promise .
a new tire was $ _num_ .
my next visit , he said , `` i dunno .
would n't recommend this company to anyone .
they never returned my call to schedule a meeting .
really you 're a pizza hut .
_num_ hour and _num_ minutes later they finally got there .
this time they show up at _num_ ... unbelievable .
we 're never ordering from pizza hut again .
also , parmesan garlic wings ... and the chili wings .
whoever owns this franchise needs to do something about this pathetic food .
food was not good .
cheese enchilada tasted like dirt .
the bean burrito was ok but i had them add sour cream and guacamole .
the prices were way too high for this low quality of food .
when we arrived , it was _num_ min until their closing time .
there were only _num_ other couples besides us in the place .
like someone else mentioned , the salsa was very bland .
lastly , the service is slow and not nearly friendly enough .
nothing special .
the tacos were ok , but the tamale was sub par .
the refried beans came out of a can as did the enchilada sauce .
we also had problems with the food .
it was really a joke and we should have complained .
we could have gotten up and walked to the register .
the chimichanga was alright - the red sauce was n't hot at all .
the salsa was very , very bland .
this place only takes cash or personal check .
worst food i have had in area .
beans were ok , salsa ok , tamale gross , enchilada bland .
will not go back .
horrible food .
they only have ground beef and chicken !
a terrible , disgusting meal that is best avoided .
in fact she gave me an `` ok '' .
the whole experience was awful .
oops , i guess someone forgot to fill it with the proper fluid .
he is really unhappy .
guess we are not going back there .
really no bueno !
wow ... they have alot of complaints and horrible reviews ... beware !
avoid this repair shop at all cost .
if i could it would have no stars .
that should be your first warning .
i would not recommend them for towing , repairs , or anything else .
my battery died and my insurance company used this company to tow my car .
when they told me over $ _num_ close to $ _num_ for everything .
so i left .
i think they knew that was a ridiculous amount of money .
i did n't pay over $ _num_ for that .
i payed it and they took part off and brought my truck back .
please do n't take your vehicle here .
do n't of anything come to this place .
it is a no good place to take your car for a fix .
for starters , this review is written by a mechanic .
i literally spent thousands of dollars for them to do nothing .
to add insult to injury , they were incredibly disrespectful throughout the process .
they are an absolute disgrace to the industry .
had there been an option , i would have given zero stars .
if i could give no stars , i would .
they overcharge and they are a horrible horrible business .
please , do not take your car here !
as others have said before me , i wish i could give zero stars .
my radiator broke down recently .
so disappointed since they were so nice at first .
they left my car in worse condition than when i arrived .
post no star .
what a disgrace !
his haircut looked super uneven and it was only $ _num_ cheaper than petsmart .
this subway had workers that were clearly not excited to be there .
i should give it no stars , but it wo n't let me .
reluctantly she went in the back to get another one while rolling her eyes .
way too over priced .
zero interest in returning .
tiny , not much inventory , and it looked like mostly older film cameras .
one waitress in the whole restaurant at 8am .
very slow service .
it took _num_ minutes for the food to arrive and it was terrible .
_num_ minutes later , no coffee .
this is not a restaurant we will likely return too .
i 've eaten at the coco 's numerous times over the past two years .
when we arrived , there were only _num_ parties of _num_ dining .
there were _num_ servers & no manager .
we were neither walked to our booth nor handed menu , whatsoever .
we both stood up & walked around & still every server ignored us .
all _num_ servers walked by & still ignored us .
so , we left & landed at to coco 's on bell rd .
slow service and food was room temp when it finally came .
eggs benedict not good unless warm .
now we know why parking lot was half empty on a saturday morning .
this is the worst restaurant in sun city , bar none .
it took over _num_ minutes for our food to be served .
we ordered prime rib and it was served cold .
it is horrible !
this was a priceline deal that looked too good to be true .
the problem was noise .
was truly a nightmare for me .
this was a priceline deal that looked too good to be true .
the problem was noise .
was truly a nightmare for me .
bad experience .
had n't been touched by the maid service .
would n't recommend this hotel .
bad experience .
i was basically told `` your screwed and stuck with what you booked .
a sign of poor customer service .
they dont even deserve a _num_ star for ignoring my calls .
it is n't bad enough that my eye doctor left there .
i would not trust them to put it in the mail .
today is the _num_ of january still no call , i call up there .
this among other things taking place is why the doc left there .
it 's tucked away in the back of a strip mall lacks curb appeal .
the salad consisted of tomatoes , lettuce and onions .
head out on a friday night date to little bite of italy .
i ordered the soup , salad and breadsticks .
it 's not a bread stick , it 's a slice of garlic toast .
it 's not unlimited but it is only $ _num_ .
it was n't bad ... it just was n't good either .
management does not care .
slow service , mediocre food .
wo n't recommend to anyone and certainly wo n't be going back anytime soon .
at this point i should have taken better notice of the patrons around us .
we sat and sat and sat for another _num_ minutes .
i was disgusted and ready to go .
our waitress returned and asked if we could wait _num_ more minutes .
the food was nothing fancy , but did taste alright .
i had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti .
ultimately my mom left , on her birthday , hungry !
well , they wo n't have our business moving forward !
i do not recommend this place for authentic italian food .
the service was unpleasant and not helpful .
they were not friendly .
oreganos is a _num_ compared to this restaurant !
that 's how our moment was ruined and our experience there .
i stopped in on a thursday night .
the restaurant is a bit dated and stuffy .
everyone dining was seated on the patio , so we sat there , too .
it was after 9:30 pm at this point , and i was starving .
baked ziti was very simple .
prices were relatively reasonable , but service was abysmal .
not going back .
nothing to write home about and do n't think i 'll go back .
not worth the time , peoria is close and better restaurants .
the food is ok ; a little pricey for the quality .
staff , not friendly , not helpful .
owner , not available .
the food was not memorable .
will not go back .
i read the coupon , and it did not mention this at all .
anyways , they did not discount the beer .
lots and lots of sauce , and btw , there was sausage there .
sausage was very bland .
sauce was very bland .
no flavors of any spice .
tasted like straight tomato sauce straight from the can .
service was horrible .
the waitress came only about _num_ times to our table .
once the server returned he brought me another check .
the staff said the kitchen closed at 7:30 ... which it was n't .
i did n't see the owners around .
felt like the staff was trying to leave early .
disappointing .
very disappointed .
nothing to write home about .
lot of food , dry , no flavor .
what a disappointment .
but certainly not worth the trip .
do n't understand the repeated good ratings .
very annoying .
one gets tired of the same all the time .
no hello , how are you , etc .
the waitstaff really act like they could care less about you .
but new ownership took over an it has slowly gone down hill .
needless to say i will never return to this establishment .
took us nearly an hour to get our food only to be disappointed .
this place sucks .
do n't eat here !
unless of course you do n't have taste buds then you wo n't care .
nice people ... bad food .
bacon , eggs and pancakes were way overcooked .
service was very slow and they may have been understaffed .
meals are not too pricy , but the food is mediocre at best .
what a mistake .
none of them even looked at us .
they obviously could not have cared less .
was greeted and seated very quickly upon entering the place , that was it .
never saw the waitress again .
went down the strip mall to bit of italy for lunch .
this is a budget american style cafe .
i received mixed vegetables that were over boiled and soggy .
avoid this place !
they have terrible service , and flowers are always dead .
terrible !
please avoid at all costs .
worst flower shop i have ever encountered !
your company 's mess up !
not good .
not going back .
however i could n't have been more disappointed .
needless to say i do not think that we will be back anytime soon .
ok , well that was a hot mess !
`` i 'll take _num_ popcorn chicken '' .
`` there is no popcorn chicken the rest of the night . ''
`` we are out of pepsi , diet pepsi , and root beer `` .
up at the window ( _num_ minutes later ?
_num_ stars were for the curt service including lack of apology ... for anything .
wo n't be back to this location .
this has to be one of the worst kfc restaurants in the us .
this is the most disgusting kfc !
so gross the gravy was crusted !
threw it straight into the trash !
instead they give out what looks like days old mashed potatoes .
gross !
and said `` i think this is a bad idea .
this food is just as boring as the neighborhood .
so i settled for my staple at new chinese restaurants : lemon chicken .
why such an overdone dish ?
they failed on both counts .
it was essentially chopped pork with plentiful diced jalapenos .
i really do n't have a reason to return .
horrible food !
i did not want to hear any further information on that one .
the pork was n't bad , good flavor , but very fatty .
the rice was nothing special , just a filler by far .
hardly any veggies or egg included in it .
i would n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
ugh .
she also said the egg roll was n't as good as before .
veggies are not fresh like they have been in the past .
the restaurant is also not as clean as it has been in the past .
if they do n't , i see how they will remain in business .
nothing near authentic chinese food .
do n't waste your time or money .
wtf long story i paid and got out of there .
i do not think i will return to try there food .
upon entering , i was less than pleased by the decor .
it just looked outdated .
the pork was bland and in little fatty strips .
the only thing i really enjoyed was that the diet coke was amazing .
bill total was $ _num_ .
not even a discount for ruining my appetite with rotten food .
but i will not return .
anyway , the food was barely mediocre , but service was terrible .
i 've been here twice , probably wo n't be a third time .
my entree really sucked the 2nd time i went , too .
not thrilled and not going back .
drinks came quick but no ice in the water .
the two strips of bacon were cheap .
not the good , thick cut bacon .
the hashbrowns were off as well .
too much butter or oil made them soggy .
but the worst part was the scrambled eggs .
they are obviously not made to order .
could n't even eat them .
breakfast was ever worse !
went here with my kids this week for dinner as invited guests .
if i were the owner , i would immediately change the corned beef brand .
when lou came over he could have cared less .
so we just let it go and figured he was having a bad day .
food was ok , nothing italian about it ( odd name choice ) .
the place itself is dirty .
although it was cheap and close to the office i will not be back .
my wife and uncle had liver , very small portions .
i had ribs -- _num_ bones were all i was served .
not worth the time , the price or the wait .
skip it .
we visited tonight for the first time .
my husband 's meal was n't quite the italian dish he was expecting .
too much `` dry '' pasta , not enough meat and veggies .
it was accompanied by doughy garlic bread .
i can not see us returning .
but , i will never be back , because of the extremely rude attitude .
the televisions around the dining room were tuned to the game .
i did n't make a scene .
this dairy queen is bad and even the stuff the managers make are terrible .
find a better location or place to go !
service is no good here .
i will not go back to this location .
new management but same poor training and employee attitude .
she said it was n't because she made it herself in the microwave .
i said you better check the microwave and she gave me more attitude .
poor customer service , dropped my ice cream on my table and walked away .
wo n't be going back .
the service is just terrible .
this is n't the place to get it .
deserves zero minus .
she continues to try and call them to no avail .
now she is sitting with no dryer and out of $ _num_ !
to date , no one from your company has ever contacted me .
this is not acceptable behavior and is unprofessional at an extreme level .
talks down to customers and is amazingly rude .
will not be going back here again !
i 've complained to them but they just blow it off .
managers say they do n't know , indifferent , bored when we ask .
no idea .
no interest .
however , there was some spice to the beef as i requested .
not a lot of spice .
and not a lot of beef .
the ratio of meat to veg was heavily in favor of veg .
these ingredients are supposed to be within the patty , like an omelet .
well , frankly , it tasted burnt .
i can get better food for less money from panda express .
my last visit there ended in a total mess .
the item i had problem with was the bean curd family style with vegetables .
the gentleman that took my order insisted that no such item existed .
when it was done they handed me a _num_ item meal in one bag .
just a hint tofu is generally square , shrimp is not .
but as i am talking with him i realized .
not sure how it was before but nothing here to bring me back .
here is a tip - do not order the fried wings .
batter , not good all the way and floating in grease .
just okay , nothing to write home about .
this place has really gone down hill over the years .
wrong .
not the best place for non spanish speaking tourists to go to .
wasted my $ _num_ on this piece of sh*t order .
food tasted terrible .
the tacos fried way too long .
the tortillas used in the mini tacos were super dry .
we regret dining at this place .
would probably have had better food at the place we originally wanted to try .
fail !
fail !
fail !
did n't look frozen but they refused to touch it .
then we get a washer and dryer delivery on a different day .
they never returned my call .
well , it would have been nice if someone would have called me back .
i was like , wait a minute , this is not acceptable .
i was like , okay , i will take the $ _num_ .
this is where it gets messy .
they did not show up for the delivery appointment .
i immediately cancelled my order and went to lowe 's .
bull crap .
why was i not surprised to find nothing but other _num_ star ratings here ?
it was _num_ inches wide .
and so would not fit .
then they told me that my tenant had refused the delivery .
this is totally false !
they are incompetent liars .
i purchased a dishwasher from home depot on december 1st .
the delivery men were horrible .
it was not .
horrible customer service , horrible business .
no communication .
not professional and full of excuses .
worst customer service ever !
horrible attitudes and do n't keep their promises .
hate this company .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
do not order from home depot because they use this company .
keep in mind this is _num_ day before christmas !
it is almost new years and i still have no fridge .
worst experience of my life !
do not use this company !
home depot never heard of such a thing .
zero stars !
please beware when buying any appliance from home depot .
wish i had looked on yelp before allowing them in my house .
would give zero stars if possible .
home depot would n't help either .
i do not understand why home depot partners with this company .
no one at the company was helpful in any way whatsoever .
i never received a call , they never showed .
i would never purchase through home depot again just for this reason .
no phone call , no nothing .
do n't waste your time with this company .
poor customer service is an understatement .
they said they would call _num_ minutes ahead of delivery , they did not .
( i was rear ended and needed repairs . )
i chose to leave the car there and pick it up later that evening .
needless to say , i chose to get my car repaired elsewhere .
if there 's negative star i would give them a negative _num_ stars .
i ca n't let them get away from this .
but when i do its a mess .
prices are n't even consistent with what they have on signs .
i miss that snack bar so much .
no snack bar .
good thing target also sells them too .
lack of customer service.
very generous with one star , dirty , dirty dirty .
worst walgreens i 've ever been to .
i would never recommend getting your prescriptions filled here .
yeah , try waiting _num_ hours and having your prescription still not ready !
i ca n't believe the lack of customer service by these incompetent employees .
pharmacist was extremely rude .
no any other questions or concerns .
ca n't i just bring my dog in ?
_num_ ) is that a service dog ?
_num_ ) what services does it perform ?
the pharmacist recognized me , and was very kind .
the pharmacy staff are the only reason why i 'm giving a two stars .
if it was just a pharmacy experience , i 'd give _num_ stars .
i 've been filling my prescriptions here for _num_ years .
it was at the very least a disappointing experience .
bad location to get your drugs from .
we 'll find another walgreens location next time around .
this is by far the worst pharmacy ever !
rx are never correct and they are never filled in the time frame .
worst pharmacy around .
every time they mess up my prescription or life .
waste of my time !
sitting here in pain because the pharmacy is `` backed up . ''
but this pharmacy has showed a complete lack of compassion and/or concern .
i started crying as we walked out of the store .
never coming back to this walgreens for anything .
soooo disappointed .
the fish was not even seasoned well .
i think the local grocery freezer could have done a better job .
i will not be going back .
they quit selling fried oysters !
could n't tell me why either .
to call this fish and chips is sooo wrong .
its nothing like fish and chips should be .
go to george and dragon in phoenix if you want real fish and chips .
fish was flakey and over fried .
also no lettuce or tomato ?
not too bad , but you have catching up to do !
we will no go back .
the only reason i put one star is because i had to rate something .
anyway we finally tried it out today and oh my it was horrible .
also the no lettuce and tomato ?
this is not my idea of fish and chips .
no fish filet here just a deep fried square of processed fish .
cash only is a little questionable .
tried this place out for date night with the husband and it was garbage .
ordered the seafood platter meal for little over $ _num_ .
the french fries were cold and the shrimp was plain weird .
the service was just as bad .
girl was rude and non accommodating at all .
would not recommend place to anyone .
also the place was beyond filthy with crack heads hanging around .
this place doesnt deserve any stars .
that 's how bad it was .
no thanks .
hey pete , can i get my money back ?
i went to get some burgers and shrimp .
sorry pete if you still around , it really suck !
the food is pretty much all fired and is always missing salt .
all locals know that it is cash only and no refills .
this place is getting _num_ stars for atmosphere and service .
for food , i would give it zero .
nostalgia would not be enough to bring me back to this place .
horrible .
this is not real fish and chips .
what i got was pete sauce .
which is a watery ketchup concoction .
you ca n't fry something and have it waiting for customers .
the fries were typical frozen , fast-food variety and were cooked okay .
after the initial couple times , it got even worse .
the shrimp is mushy but batter is hard .
use to be soooo good , and now it is just gross .
horrible , what a let down !
so disgusting now .
dont waste your time here , go across the street to filibertos .
this is _num_ .
plus the food is not all that great .
do not recommend eating here at all .
but the service is horrible !
so disgusting .
the fried shrimp doesnt look like shrimp , maybe ground shrimp .
such a horrible experience , there are no words .
i really do n't know what all the hype is about this place .
the shrimp were alright , probably the best thing i had there .
the fries were overcooked , brown and flavorless .
i 'm glad i tried it but wo n't be back again .
not good as i was expecting real fish filets for the price charged .
i wo n't be back .
horrible service here .
there was only _num_ other cars .
was better off getting mcdonald 's .
horrible service !
its not like you deserve it !
first off , i 'm pregnant and have major cravings .
my food is already pretty cold and i 'm only _num_ minutes away .
i was so unhappy with it i wanted to just cry .
i could 've just went to the gas station and got a slush there .
do n't eat here .
there were only _num_ or _num_ onion rings in the little bag .
what a ripoff .
i paid over $ _num_ for this garbage .
you can leave it overnight and we 'll look at it in the morning .
it 's $ _num_ to do a diagnosis . ''
zero customer service .
should be negative stars .
worse hotel i have ever gone to .
went on a business trip with my hubby , who is a truck driver .
there are far far better places to stay .
this place is horrible .
the lady at the front desk was extremely rude .
worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
this place was plain and simply disgusting !
i want my money back !
it was cheap .
worse inn ever !
still no towels .
not to mention there are no blankets on the bed just a sheet .
the bathroom was disgusting and the room was left as hot as an oven .
dirt around the edges of the carpet .
the bathroom was recently renovated .
it was small but not too bad .
needless to say , they need to upgrade .
useless .
- continental breakfast - no thank you .
the coffee was hot and ok .
it was only _num_ minutes from the stadium .
i am so disappointed !
the staff a used my wife and then changed my credit card three times .
terrible experience overall .
do not stay here if you are a woman or have women with you .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
the receptionist was very polite but the general manager was awful .
wish we would have read the reviews before stopping here .
most disgusting thing ever .
so we left and no refund .
do not stop here !
this place is a dump and overpriced for what it is .
but really , do n't stay here !
door from the outside looked like it should have been a closet .
we removed the sheet and comforter immediately and used our own .
every channel was black and white ; felt like we went back in time .
so disgusting and gross !
nothing could make this place better other than burning it down to the ground .
stay away !
horrible !
please oh please for the love of pete , do n't stay here .
this place was not .
the chips were greasy and stale .
the food had no seasonings .
wo n't be going back .
the food was not good at all .
only because the salsa and chips where great .
carne asada , green chile ( beef ) and barbacoa .
the meat however , not so good .
ill wait the extra _num_ min to have pan warmed rice and beans .
if i could give zero stars i would .
this place was not good at all .
the food was over priced , over cooked , and oily .
they claimed to not have chips on the weekend .
but they did have them available for nachos which were bad .
the service was slow despite having a small dining room and _num_ servers working .
and $ _num_ for a kids meal with _num_ nuggets .
i was n't expecting fine dining , nor was i expecting terrible mexican dishes .
the staff is so rude we checked out .
absolutely the worst experience at any hotel i 've ever stayed at .
the place is ok , not great or not terrible .
avoid that place at any cost .
what else do n't they wash ... hmm .
place is typical for jack in the box though somewhat dirty .
the counter with the drinks and ketchup was a tad dirty .
dirty inside , nothing stocked up .
gave me cold curly fries with my meal .
it is not a good sign when drivers will not patronize a waffle house .
the cook did n't wear gloves when grabbing my bacon from the fridge .
oh no no no !
never going there ahh !
we have n't even received our food and already feel uncomfortable .
just because we do n't eat eggs unless they are hard boiled .
this was my first time here and most likely my last time .
my dining companion and i visited this store around _num_ pm .
the servers we nowhere to be found .
my companion ordered a side salad , bacon and a strawberry waffle .
however , the most shocking part was my hash browns .
there were no onions .
it 's all very plain .
reminds me why i go years in between eating at waffle houses .
server i had was extremely unprofessional .
_num_ types of waffles on the menu .
mcdonalds breakfast blows this place out of the water and way cheaper .
brutal customer service .
if they had a _num_ star .
wish they said something before i paid my money .
our ride was scheduled for 3pm , and we arrived 30-40 minutes early .
the person who was teaching me how to control my horse was pretty rude .
same thing .
they told us in the beginning to make sure they do n't eat anything .
we did not feel that we got good value for our money .
my muscles were getting tired from kicking her so much .
also , that was super uncomfortable for me to do .
i wish there had been more educational stuff .
so frustrating to deal with .
almost every time i 've ordered it 's gotten screwed up .
you do n't really expect a lot from a motel _num_ .
but i expected a little more from this one .
if you do n't have wi-fi , just say that you do n't .
but it sure does n't deserve anything higher than _num_ .
small , uncomfortable beds , stand up shower , bubble tv and ugly .
no stains on the sheets or walls .
big dive do not stay here !
very limited chanel 's too .
light switch next to the bed does not work well .
room is void of all personality , no pictures or any sort of decorations .
this room has stains on the carpet , cracked bathroom sink .
summary ; stay away from this motel _num_ .
too bad they do n't give 1/2 star options .
this place was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
gave me a key , room was dirty and not cleaned .
i 'm like , that 's not what she told me .
they are dirty , rude and guess you get what you pay for .
she then tells me those rooms are for large families only !
i would not recommend this particular denny 's if your _num_ or younger .
1/3 of the salad was old yellow romaine lettuce .
dine at denny 's at your own expense !
_num_ minutes , still nada .
_num_ minutes of waiting we finally receive the food .
the chicken fried steak was one of the worst i 've ever had .
the hash browns were overcooked and freezer burnt .
my sausage and pancakes were pretty good though .
the eggs omg tasted as if it was really really old .
i 've never experienced anything like it .
you do n't want to risk getting sick .
so now i sit at jack in the box next block over .
avoid this place if you can .
she did not want customers .
a couple walked in behind us and after a few minutes left .
there were tables open , they were just filthy .
came here on my birthday and walked out before i could be seated .
all in all , avoid this place .
the place is dusty and dirty on the inside and outside .
wo n't be back to that restaurant .
probably my worse experience at a restaurant .
but they server made this place bad .
this is a very old denny 's and needs to be updated .
the staff are ok but my food was cold and not inviting .
one of the servers had an attitude and not friendly at all .
sorry to say but employee seem so dumb !
the absolute worst denny 's in america .
i have an idea get out your damn office and help u sorry ass !
now i know why they have so much trouble keeping this place staffed .
no urgency at all .
cook does n't care but why should he if his manager does n't either .
wish nj had more waitresses like her !
worst service ever .
if i could give no stars , i would .
i originally got weird vibes from the place .
cook at home if it comes down to it .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
i wish i could give it zero stars .
do not let your loved ones go here !
they are money hungry and do n't care about their staff or patients .
i would n't even send my worst enemy here .
the patients wait _num_ min to use the toilet !
you never see a doctor , they suck insurance dry .
i really like arby 's but i ca n't recommend this location .
they showed up at _num_ pm !
ridiculous .
these people are the worst !
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
terrible customer service !
long story short , had to pay another _num_ today .
big o will never see another penny from me .
$ _num_ for an oil leak ?
i asked him if they stay competitive with their competitors .
i told him discount tire does n't charge for balance on a replacement tire .
just a bad day for everyone all around .
i was very disappointed with this course .
they were pushing the groups out _num_ minutes early .
some tee boxes were spotty or uneven .
just below standards that i would expect from a country club .
they were slow , turning at over two hours .
here is where it gets weird ... .
did n't seem to care much when asked about it either .
nobody in the restaurant to get something to eat at the turn .
my local crap course has more to offer .
extremely disappointed .
do not take your vehicle to this sun devil auto .
i am really disappointed with dairy queen after our recent visit .
so i settled with some hot apple pie & ice cream thing .
did n't get to try this place .
i explained i only brought my debit and he just shrugged .
i ordered pasta with meat sauce .
no receipt for me to look at .
the meat was n't mixed into the sauce and was very bland hamburger meat .
anytime i have ordered meat sauce , the meat is cooked in the sauce .
in my opinion , this was n't meat sauce .
mom got a veggie pizza and i got my standard pepperoni and jalapeo .
none of it had any flavor .
i like a crispy thin crust but this was too thin .
our friend had spaghetti with barely any sauce and her garlic toast was burned .
the servers were pretty rough .
i gave two stars because the cheese in the pizza was good .
at least try to make them feel like they 're not an inconvenience .
it was my first time last friday and probably my last .
since it was a two for $ _num_ deal i tried two different sandwiches .
even the bacon was horrible , and that 's hard to do .
it was way over microwaved i think .
i had my small bottle that i keep in the suv just in case .
there should be a zero star option .
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs .
worst car wash ever !
bad attitudes & horrible customer service !
very slow & do n't care about length of time .
do n't use this place !
now it 's just sad .
i truly feel sorry for the members of this course .
many of the fairways have sparse grass and mud .
greens are very inconsistent .
not even worth the $ _num_ from local flavor .
looks like they did not put enough grass seed down .
play was less than four hours which is good .
the wait times are always ridiculous !
it was _num_ min before being called to check in at the front desk .
there were only _num_ people signed in ahead of us .
ridiculous !
weak coffee , white bread , smaller portions , nothing was particularly great .
nothing really sucked ; but was just mediocre .
everything tasted bland .
the food and service was adequate but nothing special .
the toast used for my club sandwich while lacking color was over cooked .
scratch this one off my list .
we just ordered out for hot & sour soup , and it was great .
ok not that bad .
the runny lobster sauce on the four tiny shrimp ai n't much better .
it 's a little too bland for my taste .
they even only gave one fortune cookie !
the meal was a combo menu item of szechuan shrimp and chicken .
the shrimp were over cooked and gray in color .
there was a runny liquid which was supposed to be the sauce .
the spring roll or whatever it was , was way over cooked and greasy .
will not be back .
this place has really gone downhill .
all it is is fatty beef broth with barely anything inside it .
flavorless ... ... kung pao chicken is suppose to be spicy right ?
soda was flat , rice was dry .
not much flavor to anything overall and far from vegetarian friendly .
came here for lunch , my veggies were obviously out of a can .
sorry guys , more than likely wo n't be back .
tasteless watered down sauce .
canned vegetables .
no way to use chop sticks with this food .
the pieces are cut to small to pick up with anything but a spoon .
the only thing positive is the price .
it 's cheap and that 's probably why people come to this place .
went in today and was told i owed $ _num_ .
dishonest people with a mickey mouse scam .
omg , i 'm the first to review this place .
worst pizza i ever had .
worst pizza i have ever tasted .
service is terrible .
the worst customer service i 've experienced in a long time .
but at 8pm she decided she was closed and kicked all her customers out !
i said `` then you should list closing time as 7pm .
she then yelled to everyone again `` get out ! ''
she said `` i will with customers as horrible as you ! ''
it was beyond rude .
she should never be working in customer service again .
she even rushed out a man in a wheel chair !
they refused to let her use it .
no explanation .
no apologies .
so much so that i lost my appetite and cancelled my order .
not edible .
i feel like management should take care of these things , not the waitress .
meatloaf was a grilled patty drenched in gravy .
it 's not that hard to serve better quality food .
the lady behind the register was straight up ignorant and rude !
not impressed at all .
the drinks were empty most of the time .
the food was clearly not fresh made .
i just do n't understand it .
what a rip off and `` cheese sauce ? ''
i just got flowers from my daughter in california .
lakeside charged my daughter $ _num_ and $ _num_ delivery .
not only were the flower awful she was nasty .
save yourself time and money do not deal will this business .
will not order from them again .
what a disappointment .
they did not look like the picture .
the roses were almost dead the next day .
for what he paid he could have ordered beautiful roses from a reputable florist .
i 've ordered flowers from lakeside before .
lakeside needs more competition they obviously ca n't handle any more business .
i just do n't feel heard or well taken care of .
that 's false ... .
so disappointed .
so this just threw me over the top .
i 'm there for shots , then give my son shot .
do n't tell me to wait when they are due .
my biggest disappointment was the cleanliness of the ladies restroom .
sue and roy pittsburgh , pa .
she made this poor employee charge us four dollars for my son 's sprite .
never returning needless to say .
boring .
with lots of choices in the area , we wo n't be back .
horrible sunday dining experience !
salad or italian coleslaw was offered with both meals .
the meals arrived to our table _num_ minutes after ordering .
i honestly can not understand how pasta could go so wrong .
we will not return , ever .
the receptionist was lovely , the service was awful !
slow , no check back to refill water , etc .
it was 5:00 p.m. and basically empty .
the eggplant parm was dreadful .
absolutely horrendous service , pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza .
ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food !
the decor is old fashioned , stained carpeting , old waitresses .
the pizza is n't horrendous but it is n't wonderful either .
ordered a thin crust margherita pizza .
and it was seriously one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .
and it was $ _num_ !
there is not one nice thing i can say about this place .
and , i 'm trying to think of one ... believe me .
there were only two other tables in the whole place .
_num_ minutes went by from the time we ordered , and our entrees came .
dh had a meatball sub , i ordered chicken parm .
my chicken parm was cold .
the dcor is also super depressing .
ridiculous .
allow at least an hour and a half minimum .
every time we go there it 's always the same girl waitress .
do n't get me wrong , she 's nice ... but she sucks .
super slow .
no hustle in her step .
the first really bad trip was for breakfast .
when i finally got helped , i ordered a number _num_ from the sign .
i said ... '' whatever the sign said was in a number _num_ . ''
so , i chose a few items i saw in the hot case .
i got a single slice of pizza , which was not very fresh .
i also stopped by the seafood counter before i left .
it is my understanding that bashas used to be the only store in town .
unfortunately for them .
closed before 8pm on a saturday ?
i wo n't even bother again .
i wo n't even bother again .
mediocre service and high prices !
wo n't go back .
you do n't need to buy from arizona .
unfortunately , ours was much different than theirs .
i like to shop at ace hardware stores , but not this one !
our actual check-in took maybe a total of _num_ minutes .
$ _num_ per plate buffet .
we go back to the room , and the toilet is fixed .
$ _num_ for a _num_ minute massage , $ _num_ for a spa pedicure .
few more drinks , time for a nap , you get the idea .
the room service breakfast was horrible !
_num_ out of the _num_ rooms were ready when we arrived at 3pm .
the room was given back to us , but our keys no longer worked .
oh let me guess that is not your problem .
it was quite frustrating , i just wanted the keys .
the manager sent another person with another set of keys , guess what ?
the wrong keys .
there were _num_ people in our party .
the server was very unfriendly .
big mistake .
not too happy with my last two experiences here .
when we checked in jose was unfriendly and did not listen to my requests .
carefree resort ... not my choice .
rooms smell like a sewer and the employees are not friendly .
no fridge .
the busboy was more helpful .
not much of a resort .
they did have a _num_ hr shuttle which was great in that situation .
the room was still better than the drunk tank but not by much .
the room was very dated .
it did n't even have a fridge .
the reservations manager was completely rude and not at all accommodating .
the rooms are drab .
food in the restaurant is inconsistent and the servers are the same .
front desk staff ranges from competent and friendly to incompetent and unfriendly .
it is a forgettable resort .
gal that answered the phone after transfer was also rather short with me .
and she said `` there 's no shade . ''
after an awkward silence ... i said goodbye and hung up .
i ca n't believe in az they have no shade .
i ended up booking the scottsdale resort instead .
the customer service at this place is awful .
we just got done working out and left to wash our hands .
i also needed a knife to cut my eggs ... also a first .
the customer service was poor and our room was outdated !
he said there was no manager on duty at night .
i guess i tipped $ _num_ for a $ _num_ burger and beer .
the food and service was not that great .
i would never go back .
first off the room service is terrible .
my husband and i went here for our honeymoon .
we ordered room service _num_ times and everytime we did something was wrong .
it was overcooked , not made properly , and over all completely wrong .
my fruit had mold all over it !
no one should have to deal with their horrible service .
the pool chairs are disgusting .
the food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about .
no refrigerator and the bed hurt my back .
not worth the drive , just stay in downtown scottsdale or talking stick .
booking the room over the phone took awhile .
they need to better train or get better employees .
the property is a bit dated .
i am a business traveler , i run my own charity business .
it pissed me off a little bit .
the ac does n't work right .
thanks for making my trip terrible and not fun for me and my family .
i used absolutely no hotel services either ( i never do ) .
avoid this place .
a huge disappointment .
she asked the stupid question `` who 's next ?
she checked me in without every really saying anything to me .
so off i went in search of my room .
i had on heels and walked and walked and walked .
i immediately noticed that there were gross stains all over the bed covers .
the room was so-so .
they were angry at me for walking across their parking lot to my car .
upon checkout , we informed the clerk and she did not seem too concerned .
in fact , she never bother to ask how our stay was .
i was not about to look at it for the length our stay .
also no mini fridge for some reason .
the decor was old and cheap .
however , this hotel is in need of some serious work .
there was no one in the dining room for breakfast .
good reason , it was poorly prepared .
it is a little outdated .
so no sleeping in here .
overall i just do n't think those two things are worth the money .
i did not believe that they even make mattresses of such poor quality .
let alone assume that a person would remotely get a good night sleep .
shame on you .
this hotel only redeeming quality is the lobby .
everything else about the experience was poor and i would never come back .
first of all , i do n't think it should be called a spa .
none of those things exist .
there was a basket of teas , but no hot water .
i do not recommend .
we were offered a free breakfast and _num_ % off of our bill .
clearly , this facility does not consider cleanliness a top priority .
air conditioner did n't work .
never fixed and no communication from staff .
my wedding was march _num_ .
not ready until 11:00 .
pros : _num_ .
this chinese restaraunt was overly priced , had horrible service , overall bad experience .
i would recommend going to pf changs or pei wei for the money .
please do yourself a favor and skip this place !
i 'd give it negative stars if i could .
but when they served us rotten chicken we got up to leave .
i said my chicken was bad and she took my plate without any apology .
she did n't even offer to refill my friend 's spilled soup .
hold on , i recommend you search for another place .
all of us had upset stomachs and gross tastes in our mouths again .
no ... just no .
patio seating on the roof was great for fall .
my `` vegetarian chile relleno '' was stuffed with chicken .
slow service on the roof .
food is overpriced by about _num_ % .
( i know it 's carefree , but it 's silly . )
i noticed about four empty tables as we were being seated .
food took , i am not exaggerating , over an hour .
in sum , arrogant management , inept waitress , ok food .
not impressed .
one of the worst dining experiences .
i do n't know how they could stay in business otherwise .
poor service and inedible food .
the sweet potato fries were alright .
the manager comes by _num_ minutes later : `` everything okay ? ''
manager : `` the server said the money is not on the table .
the server is sure she did n't see it . ''
this is ridiculous .
this is the worst service i have ever experienced .
i felt sorry for her .
total time spent sitting outside : _num_ hour , _num_ minutes .
total time spent actually speaking to our server : _num_ seconds .
you could not taste the food , only salt .
gordon ramsey would take one look at this menu and scream .
no warning whatsoever .
not enjoyable to say the least .
there 's no excuse for that .
you have a great atmosphere , that is ruined by the food .
wait staff is not well trained .
the service is painfully slow .
my table sat down at noon .
the food is rather atrocious .
the mixed greens , on the other hand , were for some reason warm .
i 'm not coming back .
ok we sat on the covered patio but would have much preferred inside .
our style of dining is un rushed .
it misses the mark by a long way in this area .
lastly , the desserts were not good at all .
alot of hype with no substance .
carefree station , i believe you are hanging out with the wrong crowd .
your servers are not acting in your best interest .
based on this alone , i will not come back .
p.s .
( i gave you two stars simply for your ambience ... . )
now for the bad .
it took another hour and _num_ minutes to even get our food !
when we received the food it was mediocre at best .
i had an omelet , and it was bland and under cooked .
by this point i had already decided it would be my last time there .
the menu is really eclectic in a confusing sort of way .
this would be okay if the drinks and food were better .
i go to any mexican joint and have that exact margarita for $ _num_ .
it really is absurd .
she loved it , which is a terrible sign .
the menu is extensive , including food , wine and beer .
our service was bad .
however , we were n't counting on it taking an hour and fifteen minutes .
offered and accepted dining room on roof .
unfortunately it was no good .
it was soggy , lukewarm zucchini inside a soggy , lukewarm cabbage leaf .
the whole thing was watery with no substance and little taste .
expensive meal that still has n't come after an hour and forty minutes .
no one talked to us .
used to be a favorite place but has gone way down hill .
came with bad blue cheese and wilted greens which ruined whole salad .
the only saving grace is the outdoor seating area .
do n't bother to order off the menu .
i was excited to meet our friends and try the breakfast/brunch .
she said no , what is on the menu is what you get .
this is not `` that '' type of restaurant .
not extra , not complicated , just a plain crepe .
this is not the review of a crazy angry person .
but this was just ridiculous .
they made me feel embarrassed , like a child .
carefree station is gone !
place is completely empty , tables , chairs , fixtures ... gone .
i 'll miss the patio ; rip carefree station .
food was disappointing .
i do n't understand how this place has such high marks .
maybe it 's gone downhill recently .
i do n't recommend .
weak coffee , dry biscuits , and flavorless gravy .
if you 're not a regular you will wait longer than necessary for service .
was n't clean and flies all over the place .
lady was n't that friendly .
just ok , nothing special .
terrible .
wo n't be going back !
but their work was beyond unimpressive .
but none of this happened on the day i visited .
my husband and i went here for breakfast and it was very disappointing .
the bacon was paper thin , french toast was very small .
she was so rude !
avoid this restaurant .
we have always been fans , unfortunately this morning ruined it .
she did n't even apologize .
there were only a couple of tables occupied in the front room .
we ordered house salads which were very small and very boring .
we all ordered chicken dishes which were ok - nothing special .
the espresso and chocolate martini were prepared nicely .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
sorely disappointing .
do not go here if you want a sub .
boy were we disappointed .
they totally skimp out on the cold cuts and the sandwich is mostly bread .
the secret sauce is nothing but vinegar and oil .
do n't believe the hype .
they came by for a quote , and they never contacted me again .
they are the worst of the worst -- run do not walk away .
i could n't believe it .
another customer was already waiting , as well .
i am very unhappy with this location bashas !
plus i have done this before at other bashas and albertsons .
its purely a customer service attitude !
she agreed with me but did nothing .
so yeah , i think there should be a diversity of other cashiers .
sorry i had to give low rating !
was here last night to get some korean style sushi .
the environment is pretty boring .
i was n't really impressed at all .
the sushi did n't seem that fresh .
idk but was n't feeling it .
i was n't super impressed .
it is n't anything i would try again .
as n't impressed and it is n't anything i would try again .
even then it still was n't good .
this food is terrible .
they are overpriced for flavorless food .
chicken undercooked and sushi just not done right .
a _num_ minute session !
so i would either be right on time or _num_ minutes late .
well that would cut into my _num_ minute appointment .
she made me feel very unwelcome .
: ( maybe the dr needs more practice .
i am not interested in letting him `` practice '' on me .
ca n't even pay him to do a good job .
the whole procedure took _num_ minutes or less .
sorry , but there will be no second visit .
automatically assume you will pay double whatever they quote .
i was not happy with their service for multiple reasons .
not cool when it is just a bar code that you can scan .
not please with the customer service nor the oil change .
worst care care experience i have ever had !
i did n't get out of the jiffy lube for almost _num_ hours !
attendant left grease marks on outside door handle .
not happy with this for the price it cost .
do not go in to this jiffy lube location .
following , i had to have it towed to the dealership .
this service cost me $ _num_ .
they were both rude and had all the staff looking at me weird .
horrible place !
i went there _num_ days ago and my fingers are still hurting .
i paid $ _num_ for a mani , pedi and eyebrow wax .
terrible business practices and horrible nail job .
they should call this southwest furniture .
there 's no variety here ; it 's southwest decor or nothing .
i should have stuck with my usual hair stylist instead of going there .
i guess customer satisfaction does n't matter with them .
she went in mid day and is the only customer waiting .
shortly after another gentleman walks in .
you would think cutting hair makes for a living , apparently not .
i would suggest staying away .
we did not feel welcome or valued as a customer .
horrible customer service !
i spent my $ _num_ at nick 's and they were nice to me !
he continued to tell me off .
now , i am unfortunately no longer a loyal customer .
poor business management in general .
i will not call them again .
i was wrong !
so wrong !
it was awful .
the food was mushy like it had been sitting awhile .
it was the worst chinese food i have ever tasted .
some of the food is okay but some is not .
she is never stressed ... .
we waited another _num_ minutes and still never saw anyone .
the new owners will definitely not have our business .
the restaurant was empty except for two other customers .
the eggrolls and crab puff were gross .
the rice was gross .
i lost my appetite after that .
i came here after reading online that this bakery would make custom cakes .
after just visiting their bakery right now i now know that statement is false .
but the real real big complaint i have is they never have enough cashiers .
_num_ cashier open until it 's _num_ deep and you 're waiting forever .
the guy working handed me my food and i paid and left .
his response was `` do n't waste your money '' .
the rest went into the trash .
so disappointed .
when the delivery guy finally showed , the pizza was barely warm .
so disappointed !
if i could give zero stars , i would .
i will never spend another cent in any of their stores .
i purchased a washer for $ _num_ .
ca n't tell time ?
terrible service from lowe 's .
hell no !
do i get a discount for inconvenience , absolutely not !
this is the 2nd time i 've had an issue with this location .
go to home depot or another company instead .
gross !
this item does n't work !
i 'm sticking with home depot and will use my gift cards online .
friday rolls around and no installer , no phone call .
installation fee for about _num_ minutes work .
worst store ever .
there was only one person talking to a costumer .
he told me someone else will be here shortly but no one came .
stay away from this lowes especially if you are looking to buy appliances .
i had to stop in my tracks so he would n't run into me .
_num_ % of the time , go to the lowes in north peoria .
very poor customer service .
more worried about closing than helping customers that arrive _num_ minutes after closing .
too bad lowes is slow to learn .
first walked into the store and was n't greeted by anybody at all .
he kept mixing up his words and nothing was making sense .
10/10 would never return to any lowe 's at all .
honestly , i did n't mind the fact that it took them an hour .
the fact that they were dishonest about the estimated time is what bothered me .
- they did not wash my car roof .
most of it came off even without any soap .
so , in short , do n't trust these people .
why do n't we just wash it and wax it and call it square ?
this place is a total rip off .
i will not be coming back again .
have they no shame ?
if i could give it no stars i would .
i went to danny 's and used my coupon .
disappointed cuz paid $ _num_ car wash but they do a lousy job .
i purchased a groupon for _num_ car washes here .
both times the results were far less than satisfactory .
had to go home and wash the windows again .
i 'm not looking forward to using the last coupon from the groupon .
huge mistake !
i paid extra to have my floor mats cleaned - what a mess !
they do n't know how to clean windows either .
i would n't mind the wait if the end result was good .
quality has really gone down .
you wo n't get what you pay for .
save your money , do it yourself !
left my emergency break up did not bother to put it down .
paid for a $ _num_ car wash for a truck .
dirt and dust left on dash and doors .
i took me _num_ hours to clean mess out of my husbands truck .
what rip off .
stay away from these rude lazy guys .
truck bed full of dirt not cleaned at all .
rip off .
rude total joke never again .
paid $ _num_ for detail on vw .
agree with roy h. do n't trust them with your car or detail work .
they stamp the invoice with `` no refunds '' so you 're screwed .
all i wanted was a basic wash , nothing else .
never coming back here , i would not recommend this place to anyone .
who cares , i pump my own gas .
the car wash is a completely different story .
they did make me a photo copy .
i can only imagine the nightmares of using their oil change and mechanical services !
four hours later no call to let me know car was finished .
give me my money back ?
yea , that would be great but that ai n't gon na happen !
now excuse me , i have to put back all my floor mats back .
this place is terrible be aware .
looked like a $ _num_ car wash .
terrible work ethic and customer service and a bunch of thieves .
mediocre establishment .
( unless you came across free wash tickets ) but even then .
horrible service .
paid _num_ dollars .
was the 2nd person there and all they did was knock the dirt off .
complete waste of my time and money .
i will never return to this car wash again .
even after bring my car back it still is n't clean .
i would not recommend this place .
would be better just to wash your car at home .
for like $ _num_ ?
seemed a little high but i had faith they would make my car shine .
the inside did n't even get really cleaned that well .
i will never return here and encourage everyone else to also avoid .
my $ _num_ for exam and glasses ended up costing $ _num_ .
they just continued to show me more expensive ones .
it was terrible to watch , very sad .
bait and switch is against the law .
go somewhere else and spend your groupon dollars .
i have tried to go to them twice silly me .
first time shame on you second time shame on me !
wrong !
that 's absurd !
i again insisted i just could n't afford it .
i was wrong .
i have since gotten my money back from groupon thank god .
they are rude and have the most disgusting attitude towards people .
add me to the disappointed by optical experts list .
people should be warned about this business .
so i walked in knowing my extras would total less than $ _num_ .
no , i did n't .
given my disappointment , i would never go back to optical experts .
it is nothing but a major scam !
the lenses them self were almost $ _num_ .
if i could put zero stars i would .
the worst customer service ever !
so damn rude !
literally talked to me like i was his worst enemy .
he does n't deserve any money anyone is willing to give to him .
at this point , we are just done .
worst groupon purchase i have ever made !
had originally scheduled a appointment that i had to cancel .
but , even if i was mistaken it was completely unprofessional .
i wish i had n't .
i have never been treated as poorly as here .
no dice !
bad reviews are posted for a reason !
some individuals should just close their businesses if they hate working that much .
dont waste your time or your money .
the doctor asked him to talk to me about lens options and frame options .
avoid yourself the headache and go else where please !
avoid .
i 'm in the customer service industry and worked in many doctors offices .
i do n't usually write reviews but feel compelled to warn you .
do n't go here , do n't buy the groupon !
do not got there they have over price glasses .
the ppl there are very pushy trying to sell .
beyond that there is very little positive i can say about her experience there .
case management rarely returned phone calls .
but this location is the worst one !
no apology or explanation was given .
i never recieved a bill from this business .
i do not even remember going to their office for any service .
this is really bad business practices .
what a poor customer relationship ( not service ) .
big picture on the drive-thru menu but no price .
was n't told when that was until a second visit inside the store today .
absolute worst experience ever .
i have braces with southwest dental ended up costing around $ _num_ .
wish i would have did more research !
they are very unorganized and rude .
i called in and she said she would take care of it .
overall , just a terrible experience .
full disclosure : i cancelled my appointment before even receiving any services here .
my wife had a morning appointment , and i had one in the afternoon .
after hearing her experience , i cancelled my appointment .
they would not see him if he had these which was always .
unacceptable in my opinion !
my experience was terrible !
then the so called hygienist returned and handed me the same form .
she said , ' just sign it ' .
i refused to pay and told them to bill the insurance .
they told her that she need _num_ root canal and crown .
she was quoted $ _num_ for each tooth .
so she made an appointment for one to be done at a time .
after it was done , the bill came out to be $ _num_ .
i regret referring my gf to this place .
the second visit months later was for gel nails .
this included most of _num_ of my nails .
what was the best chinese food we 've ever had is now just mediocre .
also , the new staff is incredibly rude .
what was the best chinese food we 've ever had is now just mediocre .
also , the new staff is incredibly rude .
ordered orange chicken under new management .
horrible .
very disappointed .
big greasy mess .
orange chicken was not great .
pork fried rice was dry .
only thing good was the egg roll .
would not recommend .
do n't eat here !
i ca n't believe this place had good reviews ?
horrible horrible experience and i didnt even get in the door yet !
no response from the doctor , so she does n't care either .
just be warned , tom does n't get it !
i went to pick up the car and the bill came to $ _num_ .
wo n't be going back .
i know thats bull crap .
this store is horrible .
should n't all of that have been done ?
the store is already closed so i called ups support .
what a waste of money and time .
i should 've just gone to the post office .
i 've never had such poor results from a ups store .
save yourself the hassle and use the kiosk at the post office .
horrible , horrible experience .
, i was sent to the original store to have corrected .
horrible customer service at this location .
my international ship cost was $ _num_ .
she also would not refund the shipping cost .
the next day ( saturday ) it should have been delivered by noon .
if i wanted the package there monday , the price would have been approx .
$ _num_ to ship and not $ _num_ .
she then offered a _num_ % discount .
that 's still not acceptable - i paid $ _num_ .
she said she would call her area manager to see what could be done .
this simply is n't true .
avoid this store !
i would give this review negative stars of i could .
seriously people , do not waste your time .
the second employee said she 'd have to take me at another computer .
absolutely ridiculous .
i will be sure none of my packages come near this store again .
they certainly do n't deserve the business .
the brisket and ribs were dry and tasteless .
the service was not very good either .
it took _num_ minutes to get greeted and asked for our drinks .
it took another _num_ minutes to get our drinks .
she drops them off and then leaves right away to take another tables order .
then _num_ minutes later she comes and takes our order .
so she gave us _num_ five dollar coupons for next time .
i dont think there ever will be a next time .
had the combo plate with beef ribs and sausage .
the sausage was not even luke warm .
the beef ribs were tough , fatty and not very tasty .
they seem to have a problem with service .
i wish i could give a _num_ , but i cant .
service , slow .
potato salad , eh .
was i wrong .
we hoped dine-in would be different , and even made reservations .
i was really embarrassed .
the plastic table cloth was completely stained and disgusting .
i did n't want to touch it .
and no one felt like they got enough bbq sauce , and c'mon !
looked gross . )
no thanks .
i wo n't go back .
this was me and my fianc favorite little place to go .
ya ... _num_ min later no drinks and mind you it was not busy .
she then proceeded to walk away yes !
then she comes back to tell my fianc that his id was fake ... .
he is _num_ years old .
she then proceeded to tell us to leave .
she gave attitude to my fianc before he ever became upset .
i even tried writing them again and was ignored .
i 'm not one of them .
service was lacking - waitress did n't know the menu .
i agree with other yelper 's - there are much better bbq places around .
neither one of us could eat it .
went because we had a groupon , wo n't be back .
fortunately the bbq sauce was heated so the sauce warmed up the meat .
the baked potato was cool in the middle and the dinner roll was tasteless .
no other bread options exist .
i wish i had better things to say .
service is slow in the bar area .
_num_ min wait for two salads .
turkey ( tasted like a horrible thanksgiving bird or just thick sliced lunch meat .
who serves bbq with gravy for god 's sake ? )
no smokey flavor whatsoever . )
no , seriously , the onion rings were amazing .
i 'm just not the type to make a scene in public over food .
and i 'm not kidding .
ugh .
they obviously do n't know what burnt ends really are .
the `` smoked '' turkey .
a little better but not smoked as far as i could tell .
( no smoke rings ) .
the baked potato with butter and sour cream .
how do you mess that up ?
it did n't taste house made .
sorry , `` c '' .
called in a take out order for my first try here .
the issue here is that it was neither .
the entire wait staff acted as if they could care less .
had it been our first ever visit , we would n't be coming back .
the girl was very rude .
lol i asked for a manager but nope no one ever came .
had n't been there in many years .
the decor and ambiance improved , but the food was a disappointment .
$ _num_ for the ribs ... a rip-off .
the baby back pork ribs were good , and fell off the bone .
we started off with order of onion rings and spinach and artichoke dip .
both unimpressive .
ordered the sausage which was more like a hot dog in bbq sauce .
mac n cheese creamy and comforting but tasteless .
cinnamon butter interesting but the roll was not .
the food was decent but nothing to rave about .
lost a point for poor customer service .
way too main stream and over-priced .
employees were rude and slow , even when there were not many customers waiting .
service has gotten worse and worse at this location .
keep driving and find a better location .
the other bad reviews on this location are right on par with my complaint .
the female cashier i encountered was rude .
guess not .
starbucks has done _num_ thing i 'm thankful for .
my parents ' generation had to deal with cheap diner coffee .
that said i am not a fan .
i gave up drinking pop _num_ years ago .
that requires light to medium roast and fresh beans .
thanks but most diners these days have better plain coffee .
but it is not quite the experience i remember from even 5-10 years ago .
i would give negative stars if i could .
`` this is the worst starbucks ever !
i will skip going to starbucks at thunderbird road next time .
there was no one in line and two people already sitting with their beverages .
no dairy .
terribly slow , always .
this kfc is hands down the worst .
he states `` ok but you will have to return my chicken '' .
avoid like the plague !
ordered _num_ of the new loaded chicken bowls .
worst .
if i could give no stars , i would .
i have been a long time fan of kfc chicken .
anyway , i pulled around front and waited _num_ minutes and still no chicken .
i went in and waited several minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence .
the girl that originally took my order would not make eye contact with me .
so after waiting _num_ minutes for my chicken , it was finally ready .
much worse than that was the fact that the dark chicken was raw !
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
probably will not be back to this location .
i have n't been back and will never be back .
i waited _num_ minutes today with only two cars ahead of me .
they 're not friendly , but they 're not rude .
this place is ridiculous .
absolutely disgusting dried out greasy chicken .
what happened to kfc ?
came to get favorite meal but told out of chow mein .
advised it would be an hour or hour and a half before more arrived .
food was old ... mushy .
manager did n't seem to really care .
it makes me sad .
there 's not even a single cross at this place .
i was very disappointed and due to this stopped attending .
very disappointing .
was a meat less type of service and very impersonal .
i hate to be mean .
crap service .
the menu does not have a lot of selection , either .
rice and beans were fine nothing special .
the shrimp tasted old and were almost soggy .
do not recommend and will not be back .
do n't drink the water ... or eat the food .
the restrooms stink to high heaven .
do n't think i will be back there anytime soon .
this was my experience the last time i was there .
then why are we all sitting here !
their tortillas are just horrible .
no booze there though , just solid mex .
if i show up when they are there , my beer is free .
the service is hit of miss .
fajitas usually have too much black pepper and the tortillas are too thick .
service is hit and miss and the kid 's meals are a bit expensive .
there are better and worse mexican food restaurants to eat at in phoenix .
i ordered the nachos , these come with ground beef .
as i was digging in , i noticed a red part in my meat .
they were terrible .
really no fish .
just a very small amount of this disgusting chopped up fish stuff .
not even sure it was fish .
basically i paid _num_ for lettuce and cheese tacos with beans and rice .
not one person asked me how my food was .
no refund no can we get you something else .
very disappointing .
the food is simply horrible .
the service is ok , nothing special .
the chicken was perfectly cooked but everything was so bland .
i would def go back for drinks though !
short story : very `` americanized '' mexican food at higher than necessary prices .
for the food : the fish taco is not recommended , fishy and bland .
the beef taco , i did think was good .
sorry i did n't find more to like !
avoid the margaritas ( and sweet and sour overload . )
eat the chips and salsa , maybe a super expensive cheese crisp .
avoid all other foods !
mushy mushy .
taco was greasy , green chili burrito was bland and almost dry .
the margaritas were watered down and did n't have much flavor .
no peppers or onions inside , dry and terrible !
this place sucks .
chips were stale , salsa below average and we had to ask for them .
food was bland and tasteless .
they should change their name to `` clearance shelf . ''
it took over _num_ minutes to get the drinks .
you use a cheese made with that much oil .
they were swimming in the grease from the beef topping .
will give it a second chance but will definitely not order the nachos again .
it 's such an easy fix ?
waitress tried to rip us off .
bill was $ _num_ and half our party paid $ _num_ !
waitress tried to hand me a $ _num_ dollar receipt .
unbelievable i wo n't be back after that trick !
this was a horrible experience .
i looked online and could n't find a gluten free menu for this place .
she recommended the number three ( _num_ tacos and _num_ enchilada ) .
i will never go back to this place again .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
take my advice : do n't waste your time .
but the frozen margarita was awful .
i actually sent it back -- and i never do that .
it had no flavor and no alcohol .
not good for a place called top shelf !
food is mediocre .
our `` quick '' bite to eat latest almost _num_ hours .
probably wo n't be back .
sorry , this place has really gone downhill .
food is still just average , but the drinks are almost worthless .
very underwhelming food , and the service is terrible .
i used to be a top shelf fan , but no more .
being from san diego , i know good mexican food .
wish i 'd read reviews before i wasted my time .
a mexican restaurant ?
however , the food does not meet the quality expectations of what it cost .
very very tasteless food , drinking water that i could shock our pool with !
waitress was nice , prompt service but food is bad .
if you like bland mexican food than this is your restaurant .
there are other better choices but they are further away .
not what i would call top shelf .
after _num_ minutes my mini chimis are in the fryer ?
ridiculous , they were not even very busy .
lots of empty tables .
unfortunately i was hungry and ended up leaving without eating .
this place just is n't what it used to be .
food has really gone downhill .
ugh .
after last nights two awful entrees , i 'm done .
really disappointed with today 's visit .
she stated that she would bring another bowl of chips .
she returned with another bowl of chips .
she refilled a drink and still no additional salsa .
the salsa was very runny and it is usually chunky .
it is a shame this is my go to restaurant .
worst experience yet .
service mediocre at best .
customers then walked over the rice and chips and yuck .
terrible quality food .
taco salad had water at the bottom making the shell mushy .
husband agreed that his meal was of low quality as well .
other than that the food is n't that great .
the shredded beef was plain .
the green burro was wrapped in layers of tortilla which just made everything dry .
disgusting .
so disappointed .
guacamole was flavorless .
no gluten free menu .
waiter wasnt real sure if chips were all corn or a blend .
the water tastes terrible so i had to ask for an iced tea .
the food was so bland that i had to add a ton of salt .
even with sour cream and guacamole , it was bland .
wish i would have read the reviews before going .
we have tried this place _num_ times so far , and i am underwhelmed .
the chicken was dry and flavorful , and the veggies were soggy .
should be called bottom shelf !
top shelf margs were good , but the food was awful .
my husband ordered an a la cart burro that tasted like school food .
it was a huge tortilla ( definitely not fresh ) and flavorless ground beef .
if you go , keep your expectations low .
bottle beer selection was ok.
cash only no big deal .
so my recommendation is do n't go out of your way to eat there .
they barely acknowledge you when u come in and sit at bar .
sorry , just not my kind of place .
horrible service !
horrible quality !
requested _num_ times online to receive an estimate .
i waited at home all day , no one ever showed up .
i was assured that was no issue .
on wednesday he came out to give me a price .
the installers showed up on time but did a terrible job .
sloppy work , no attention to detail .
pieces of old fence and concrete left all over the yard .
no pride in workmanship .
we are going to have another fence company fix their shoddy work .
wasted a day of work waiting for them to show at my house .
no show .
some of the holes are something out of a video game .
had a really bad experience with the starter there .
i still think about it to this day and this happened _num_ months ago .
but there 's no way i will ever send someone to this place .
not ever in a million years .
i am not sure i will ever play there again .
the service was incredibly poor .
were we wrong !
for the price we paid , this completely unacceptable .
wait , we paid for all eight players .
we play and it 's super slow .
the group in front is taking _num_ mins to play a hole .
it 's run terribly , no responsibility from any of the staff or management .
wow , was i put off by the negative service at this place !
it took us almost an hour to play the hole as a result .
my experience felt like a snap hook right into the water .
just pure disappointment !
the golf course was absolutely beautiful but customer service was terrible .
bad bunkers greens not nearly as nice as before overall average course condition .
played golf there today and worst experience ever !
spend your money somewhere else .
do n't make the drive for a bad atmosphere to play in .
as it turns out , we could n't have been more wrong .
ultimately , my wife simply took what mrs .
it was difficult to find and when we did it was locked .
the facial was ok , but the massage was not .
it was a limp massage and a waste of time and money .
i hate leaving a spa feeling ripped off .
you have been warned .
i just got an email from the school stating i owe them $ _num_ !
overall disappointing .
needless to say he never called back .
it was truly a ridiculous rule !
they told her she could go as fast as she wanted or as slow .
i would have giving this school zero stars if i was able .
they do n't deserve even one star !
sunday brunch ... mediocre food , poor service .
service was awful , food not much better .
spent about $ _num_ for party of _num_ , $ _num_ too much .
rude waitresses under pressure .
the fries were decent but nothing special .
i said no i 'm done , check please ... .
we stopped here before heading out to phoenix , arizona on a wednesday afternoon .
no call .
i am thoroughly disgusted with their attitude towards customers .
disgusting ceiling fans !
and no air condition .
waiting _num_ minutes and counting for food .
received food after _num_ minutes .
one counter person friendly the other was not .
will not come back .
no soda for you !
do n't use this company .
i could n't believe it ... .
make sure you get an estimate before services are performed .
this should be zero stars .
she does not smile and lacks in customer service .
passing through last week we stopped in for lunch .
she was tired and slow , we 've never had lunch take so long .
ordered steak & shrimp special .
why so much parm cheese i have no idea .
if you are not reading this ... .
the previous reviews were promising .
my halibut was cold in the middle .
it turned me off so badly my appetite was ruined .
this was my 1st time at the bistro and it will be my last .
too late then when i had already left .
she had no idea .
she said the wine sits in the sun all day .
the bistro does not have a gluten fee menu .
mine came with twice baked potatoes .
the waitress said she would ensure they were gluten free .
she said he potatoes were not gluten free .
i settled on a plain baked potato .
there were only five tables occupied .
my baked potato turned out to be potato medallions .
my salmon was too dry to eat .
our waitress said she was sorry as she gave us he check .
not my favorite meal .
my husband 's almond salmon was really dry .
if you are gluten-free , this is not your best choice .
the tough , overcooked , thick sliced meat on garlic bread was truly offensive .
i 'm a long term customer who will not be back .
at that point my husband would have been done with his meal anyway .
i 'd give it less stars but i ca n't .
apparently a reservation for 7:30 means you ca n't get in until _num_ .
_num_ means whenever there 's a table open .
do n't bother making a reservation _num_ days in advance it means nothing .
i am so disappointed .
needless to say , i was overly satisfied .
i reviewed the menu during work and could not wait for 7:30 .
i was confused because we had reservations .
she was less than sympathetic and simply said , ok.
what is the point in having a reservation , my husband asked .
this place had high expectations when i walked through the door .
unfortunately they were not met .
well i was so wrong .
the sides were sub par and the bread was just frozen and warmed up .
all in all it was nothing special at all .
sat at the bar until _num_ , then got seated .
ordered food at _num_ , and got served at _num_ .
_num_ of _num_ meals was cold , _num_ was wrong .
got out of there by _num_ .
fly annoyed us all through dinner .
dirty , do n't touch anything !
worst gas stop in _num_ miles .
avoid .
this place is downright scary .
i stopped into use the bathroom and i was going to purchase a drink .
little did i know what i was getting myself into .
once i finished with my business , i went inside to return the key .
the store has an atm , but the atm is really old .
rip off alert !
rip off alert !
_num_ for regular , 1/2 block off the freeway .
buyer beware someone at this gas station .
this is a very slow taco bell .
mistake wrong course .
at the same time , our server was serving drinks to another table .
very disappointed !
some apartments have ten residents living in a _num_ bedroom _num_ bath apartment .
the tenants seem to have endless kids living in two bedroom units .
the excitement does n't end here .
i got bit by a dog and sick from weed smells everywhere .
take your money somewhere else that 's affordable and nicer .
this alone is not worth the drive .
hardly anyone but a few kids with orange cones were there !
the shopping area is mainly abandoned with most shops going elsewhere .
unfortunately i have to say i do n't think i will be back .
the only place that had people in it , was an irish pub .
cause as everyone else before me mentioned -- this place is dead .
so i just visited lake las vegas on a whim .
it 's not a close drive from the vegas strip .
first thing when you arrive is you think , is this place even open ?
but no one is there .
the whole village is empty .
however , on the plus the surreal is part of the strange appeal .
tourists , you have been warned .
i keep checking on this place once a year and it just getting worse .
maybe a holiday weekend better , i do n't know .
they can be there all hours of the day and night .
apparently , they 've created restrictions for taking pictures on the property .
there was no sunday brunch set up .
we had corn beef hash , egg benedict and breakfast sandwich .
i might get my lip scratched by drinking it .
i guess i was wrong .
unfortunately i have to say i do n't think i will be back .
no marshall on the course .
the pace of play is ridiculous .
this is a very touristy course , avoided at all cost .
i went over this past saturday to get an oil change .
it looked like no one was working .
luckily , groupon gave me a credit for this purchase .
dont buy thier groupon .
nowhere on the groupon does it state that an appointment needs to be made .
he then told me an appointment needs to be made .
i immediately contacted groupon to be refunded .
do n't buy the groupon , they 'll never let you use it .
staff , well the guy i dealt with , are rude and slow .
does n't say appointment needed on groupon , this is false advertising .
this place is a f n joke !
the lazy mechanic took it of and never put it back .
that 's what i get for trying to save money on a oil change .
unbelievable .
i 'd give them - _num_ stars if this site would let me .
they feed on people that do n't look like they no anything about cars .
i 've been shopping here for _num_ years for weekly groceries .
adam radio 's back to her and says that he will not do that .
he explained that he is not allowed to key a credit card transaction .
i ca n't believe this place .
i have never had as much trouble with a medical office as this one .
do n't support businesses that do n't support veterans !
by far the worst experience i 've ever had .
this doctor and his nurses do n't even deserve one star .
then they sent me on my way after charging me $ _num_ .
do not waste your time or money on this terrible , lazy doctor .
the only person worth rating in here is the gal who answers the phones .
everyone else needs some lessons in time management .
the head nurse then informed me that i was n't even next !
man i just got off the phone with the water nazi .
damn thats a drink at the cosmo .
worst coffee ever .
food was so-so but man was the coffee bad !
did n't make a difference .
unfortunately the view was better than the food .
my husband had the tuna melt which was bland .
i made the mistake of stopping here for dinner .
what the hell was i thinking ?
i was hungry , it was getting late .
it was closed ... then take it off the freaking sign !
this place is pretty much a truck stop , nothing more .
i 'll stop now before it gets ugly .
this was probably the worst mistake of the trip .
ugh .
no one should really cook `` asian '' food unless they are actually asian .
the brownie was edible , but not by much .
no frills casino , so do n't expect it .
not so much .
the buffet is terrible !
everything was cold and gross !
my dad basically just ate cold potatoes and ice cream .
the only saving grace of that dinner was the guy making the cheese steaks !
but ... they only serve those one night a week !
the smokey smell is pretty bad .
very old fashioned , like a step back in time .
also the cafe had very low prices for big portions .
the steakhouse ... what crap .
there were _num_ tables that had people at them .
our food took _num_ minutes to come out .
reminder , there were _num_ , maybe _num_ tables at this point .
the place never got busy , we never even had anyone seated near us .
we did n't have drinks , appetizers , or dessert .
absolutely ridiculous .
do n't act as if you are some fancy ass strip steakhouse .
tourist are n't lining up and neither are the locals .
while there , we needed to eat , so we tried the buffet .
this is the oldest running casino in the nation !
not much to see here .
there 's a cafe , buffet and steakhouse .
all _num_ serve the same giant fatty rough looking prime rib .
would not even think of going here again .
it was the worst dinner i have had in years !
the `` steak '' was 1/4 inch thick at the most , tasted awful .
the `` mashed '' potatoes were gummy and strange tasting .
on the good side , the staff were friendly .
this place is terrible in so many ways .
and not in the so terrible it 's good way .
but do n't expect anything good here .
good beer is a no .
the massive sign promised a cheap steak and some gambling fun .
the beverage list is very limited .
in this case nothing more substantial than corona was available .
you ca n't do worse than this .
be nicer to your future customers .
i did n't want to stay there .
ate breakfast at iron rail caf this morning .
however , sadly that is not an option .
this is not the worst part about the situation as you will see .
all because they did n't put up with horrible service at the restaurant .
they were treated very poorly and with very little respect .
that is not ok !
we went and it is highly disappointing .
do not recommend .
i 'm sure many people have gotten sick from this place .
do not eat here .
then the server takes forever to pick up dirty plates .
so rude !
it 's a bummer that they would n't accommodate .
looked like stew with tomato sauce dumped over it .
no whip creme .
two bites , i was done .
only eat at the buffet if you want to get sick !
food was tasteless and service was deplorable .
big mistake !
baked salmon looked like a folded over paper towel burnt around the edges .
both of us were up half the night sick .
the only reason i gave it one star was because the waitress was nice .
worst costumer service at front desk ever !
couldnt go back to sleep so we decided to call front desk to complain .
we had a shared wall with loud music playing all night long .
how do you mess up hot dogs ?
finally cancelled my account recently and waited a bit to post this .
avoid this branch like the plague .
we rented here for approximately _num_ months .
i would never rent here again .
awful apartments !
there is a terrible roach problem .
the pool is infested with roaches .
they refused to let us break our lease .
came back _num_ minutes later and my unit was empty .
horrible experience , much more expensive than others .
the guy counted the boxes right but put _num_ on my bill .
the old man behind the counter was rude .
he asked me for id and a card .
only to make sure to have the van returned on full gas .
when i asked to speak to a supervisor , he hung up on me !
i called back but he would n't answer my call .
this is an extremely racist office .
every time we order from this location it 's terrible .
corporate really needs to get involved here .
ordered online , because it should be that easy .
my family has ordered previously and had no problems .
but recently it has completely gone downhill .
for the past two attempts , our pizza has never been prepared correctly .
ordered _num_ medium pizzas : first was missing something .
and our third pizza was barely sauced and missing cheese on two whole slices .
this location is just a complete mess .
never ordering from here again !
just ordered two pan pizzas and they arrived undercooked and full of dripping grease .
i will not be ordering from them again .
they used to have great pizza , do n't know what changed .
no more .
counter and checkout service here can be hit or miss .
_num_ stars .
well of course i did n't ; they told me not to .
i suggest you do n't give them the opportunity to disappoint you , too .
it just seems to get worse and worse every time .
oh well , i tried and they failed .
the bad : pretty much everything else .
_num_ stars .
we are sending a letter to their corporate offices and nevada health board .
i 'm not looking for a `` free meal '' .
just want them to know how there so called restaurants run .
( like we did n't already know ) .
the tech instead said , `` we check everything '' .
the worst !
horrible !
ridiculous !
would not trust to perform surgery or do anything but shots !
he should not be in practice .
i wish i could give no stars !
if you have a very sick pet do not take them here !
puppy died _num_ days later with hospital care .
he has no compassion for humans or animals .
i took my dog in there because she was having a hard time breathing .
recommend you do n't take your dog to this clinic .
he refused to redo the surgery to get the rest .
now another $ _num_ to redo the surgery .
the experience just was n't what we expected .
made an appointment and still ended up waiting _num_ minutes before deciding to leave .
there were several open rooms and the vets were walking around `` bored '' .
took my dogs to this vet for four years .
however , you get what you pay for .
the servers are rude especially if you are dining alone .
the food was mediocre at best .
the food is mediocre and over priced .
the bottled of wine arrived shortly , unlike our food .
it was about 8pm we stopped in and were overwhelmed with awesome decor .
more pretentious than amazing .
so , i left .
i told her why i was so livid and she addressed it with concern .
she said she 'd refund the difference , we then hung up .
kitchen nightmares needs a new season soon !
fish over cooked , pasta over cooked , apple tart under cooked .
vegetables and baked potato cold as ice .
to bad because it was one of our spots .
none of us will be returning .
my husband and i went here for a date - trying out something new .
it 's terrible !
not cute .
our waitress , was terrible .
she never checked on us once throughout the entire evening .
it was disgusting .
someone had dumped marinara sauce onto the chicken .
once again - disgusting .
it seems as though the chef does n't care about his or her food .
we will not be coming back .
will not be going back !
lasagna in a bowl ?
employees look like they hate their job .
milkshake was like drinking milk .
food was cold and not warm at all .
the meal was bagged and handed to me by the store mgr .
i wish i could give no stars .
this is the worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
ice cream machine is out .
the women who work here , hate their lives .
the table he wanted had some kind of white creamy junk on it .
she asked for paperwork to confirm my dog was a service animal .
`` this will not turn out well for you . ''
the dishes were more than _num_ years old - without a single chip .
professional packing was the only way to go .
plates were were piled flat - plates will break if they are not standing .
the set is now worthless .
i would not recommend this store for any purpose .
the customer service was terrible !
guarantee that would n't be the case if we were face to face .
so , this hotel is located in what seems like the edge of nowhere .
the pool is small and nothing special .
i would never stay here again .
oh hell no .
over all the food is crap .
they do n't have a lot of food .
the food is cold and not the best taste .
the rio buffet is much better .
the guy even asked me what room i was staying in .
how fucking terrible .
casino doesnt have a poker room .
atm costs like _num_ to pull money out .
place is pretty terrible .
this was bad news from jump .
the hotel entrance was behind the building and not well marked .
check in was a disaster .
i refused to pay for it and started to walk out .
i was to have a non smoking room with a king size bed .
the shower tub was straight out of a motel _num_ .
it did n't have a fitted sheet .
just nasty .
next morning i checked out without exploring anything else there .
so , i went to fill up my plate .
meanwhile , food is cooling down .
so , minus _num_ stars for bad service .
cheese tortellini was awful .
the orange chicken was mostly just orange tempura batter .
bad example .
bad example for a buffet .
worst hotel experience ever .
oh no , i 'm late !
day _num_ , can i please have batteries for the remote ?
oh , and the _num_ plastic drinking cups have been used and thrown away .
maybe they should advertise as a camping casino .
i did n't look hard enough or just missed them all together .
they told us to check a later to see if a room was ready .
all three of those rooms smelled like cigarette and cigar smoke .
none of them were of any help .
luckily , we discovered that the pool area was large enough to practice .
and since we were using the space to practice , we could n't practice .
so , we had to dish out $ _num_ .
the food at the buffet ranged from good to okay to bad .
i still ca n't stop thinking about how horrible it was .
most of it was cold or like the turkey was dry .
let 's me know they do n't care about there customers .
very attentive and quick to bring our bags to the room .
not this time .
the room , while not dirty , was on the shabby side .
to be fair , the hotel was n't all bad .
everything worked , but it was outdated and not well maintained .
i will not be returning .
this is n't a bad place to stay .
no light bulb in one of the lamps .
in fact this trip , i had to look hard to find quarter slots .
the casino is smokey some days and not as bad on others .
there 's nothing fancy , but for $ _num_ , it 's a steal .
the big problem here is the food .
the buffet is awful .
we did breakfast at the fiesta cafe and it was slightly better .
the room was a complete disappointment .
cheap , cheap , cheap !
on the italian section , only the pizza remains a constant .
the selection is poor and the once to die for sticky buns are gone !
fiesta henderson ( a station hotel ) was not so nice .
i thank hotel impossible for teaching me what to look for .
overall , if i had to i would stay there again .
bad service ran us right out the door in a few quick minutes .
we never got to know whether or not we liked the actual casino .
first of all , the buffet is so gross and everything looks awful .
then worked in the buffet and how gross .
they did n't wash their hands that is so nasty .
this casino is very sketchy and i would not let anybody come here .
i was not mad at him , he was just doing his job .
this was not to be .
so i think next time i will stay elsewhere .
not sure i will have a reason to come back.
which made me instantly feel sick to my stomach .
it would be nicer and cheaper to just stay at a holiday inn .
the worst experience ever !
rude bartenders and rude management !
however , our stay was cut short .
about _num_ minutes later the ac turned off , with the room still hot .
we quickly realized what was happening .
it was horrible .
i just wish we had gone there first .
do not be fooled by the website .
but that is not the case .
we booked _num_ nights in june .
checked in late on a tuesday night - a non smoking room .
we go to bed and the sheets and pillows smell like smoke as well .
it was disgusting .
the shower in the bathroom barely heated up and the water pressure was sad .
she does not ask why .
they checked out the wrong room .
do not spend your money here .
seriously disgusted with this whole thing .
i would give them negative stars .
after _num_ minutes she returned with a piss poor attitude and took our orders .
the food was pretty much an embarrassment to feed to people we brought here .
it 's just all around bad .
we did n't enjoy our stay at the fiesta very much .
it badly needs a significant renovation .
sunday brunch was terrible .
the scrambled eggs were rubbery dry .
our wait person could not be found for initial drink requests .
this is unbelievable for such a venue .
i guess i 'll find out in a few here .
overall , this hotel is not bad .
this is the worst hotel/casino i 've ever stayed .
first of all the bed was really uncomfortable .
second , there was no hot water at 3am .
third , the food was nasty .
lastly , the front desk girls need lessons in customer service .
the front desk needs lessons in customer service .
the only good thing is starbucks ... heads up to ya 'll !
this place is horrible .
no hot water .
also the room is so smokey it was like smoking a pack a night .
we stayed here last week because they are a pet friendly hotel .
honestly i should have looked elsewhere .
the buffet was lackluster at best .
stay away from hotel , yikes !
people have mentioned , bed bugs on yelp !
i was very unhappy !
all my clothes , even the ones i did n't wear smell of smoke !
this place is not worth the price .
the only good thing about it was the pool area and the gift shop .
bad decision .
will not be coming back here .
review is specific to the buffet .
food was marginal at best for a buffet .
wo n't go down that road again .
i stayed here but was disappointed as its air conditioner does not work properly .
one of the worst stays i had in any hotel .
they did n't have our room , they gave our room to someone else .
they could n't do anything about it .
the hotel is outdated .
beds are terribly uncomfortable and mattresses are well past their prime .
carpet is torn and stained .
the worst part is the front desk staff .
my reservation for a king bed meant nothing .
and , they charge a daily resort fee .
disappointed .
room : average , _num_ queen sized beds , hot shower and clean sheets .
pool : lame !
dumb !
just put them outside in the pool area .
_num_ minute drive to the strip as long as there 's no traffic .
all in all , i 'd never come back here .
spend the extra money for a nicer stay .
the _num_ dollar room they advertised turned into a _num_ dollar room .
there web site said the $ _num_ rooms still available .
i was just too tired to go down and argue with the clerk .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
thought it was so disgusting .
if i could do negative stars i would .
this hotel is disgusting .
are n't they supposed to be ?
the wallpaper is peeling off the walls .
the tv is n't connected and does n't work .
the previous guest apparently was generous enough to leave their food behind .
i ca n't believe that this hotel was this bad .
i found another hotel and left asap to check in a few miles away .
run , do n't walk away from this hotel .
it 's cheap for a reason !
worst checking in my _num_ years of travel .
no common sense here .
this place is awful .
bites all over ... emailed the hotel management about the incident .
casino & restaurants were fine .
just avoid sleeping here .
bob your attitude sucks !
horrible and rude !
the smoky room was terrible .
it 's pretty mediocre .
royal flush ur money down the toilet capital of the world !
worst place to gamble !
terrible place to book a stay !
never again will we be staying there .
i did n't really care about playing with my players card at first .
no , i did n't complain to her when she told me this .
if i could rate it _num_ stars i would .
bathroom was grimy and the shower looked so bad i did n't take one .
the pool was closed and the staff was rude .
hands down worst place i 've ever been to .
the room was dusty and filthy .
completely disgusting .
that and also the line to check out was ridiculous .
i wo n't be staying here again just based on those things .
there is no excuse for either of those .
it 's too bad i kinda liked this place .
example : _num_ free games on one - total bonus win was $ _num_ .
i asked him to get a supervisor for me and he ignored me again .
so i asked another employee .
because of him and the attentiveness of management i gave this place _num_ stars .
$ _num_ down the machines and i never once got offered a drink .
this place is going downhill .
terrible .
no good live music , the buffet is no good and they 're rude .
the room was dusty and filthy .
i won , they lost .
we stayed for _num_ nights and we will not be returning .
you can only fool people for so long .
and this is why people do n't gamble as much anymore .
i wo n't go back .
you wasted your money !
_num_ : front desk staff : overworked and it shows .
what a mess !
i only left one star because i had to .
this place is atrocious .
only left one star because i had to .
i got there at _num_ i was told _num_ hour wait .
needles to say after another hour and a half i left without being seen .
they do not take appointments for sick visits .
that really sucks .
so basically there is a waiting room full of sick people .
my last visit was for a bad cough that was n't going away .
i do n't know how they do it .
i go to pick up my prescriptions and only _num_ made it .
they take my id and i wait for 20-30 min .
_num_ hours later and cvs still has not received anything .
do n't try to call , they just put you on hold .
this place is awful !
: it was _num_ minutes before they closed , apparently the good dr .
but this guy did n't do that .
rude employees , do n't carry diet coke for those who need it .
horrible and i hope wendy 's takes care of this problem .
horrible idiot working the drive thru tonight !
this is the one of the worse wendy 's ever !
again i went to this wendy 's ... today for lunch .
i wanted a burger & sprite , my pregnant co-worker wanted a baked potato .
then no sprite !
so again i spent my lunch break driving to another wendy 's !
last week they gave me the right salad but no dressing !
horrible !
worst wendy 's in henderson !
wrong .
gross !
a shame too , it 's on my way home from work .
this wendy 's is the worst one i have ever been too .
i ordered a frosty and a cheeseburger and she managed to mess that up .
they proved why they should not make $ _num_ an hour .
only problem the food was not warm , more on the cold side .
he got a slight attitude with me and gave me a half ass apology .
it did n't used to be like this .
crappy cashier stood and stared at me instead of greeting me .
no one came out to signal that they were up and running again .
it took almost _num_ minutes to finally get my meal .
do not eat fast food unless you really can not afford anything else .
the food was awful , nasty just no !
worst jack in the box i have ever been too .
the good all tasted nasty like they had n't changed the oil in years .
i wo n't be going back to this location .
drive thru is always slow .
hard to leave pleased .
it 's really irritating !
_num_ sauces for two tacos ? '
and continued staring at me as if i requested too many .
it just seemed stupid to question that .
there was two as advertised , and they were very very small .
about two and half inches long by _num_ inch wide .
ate there often as it was close to work until i got food poisoning .
had my usual chicken nachos and was sick for three days .
i have no idea why there are so many good reviews .
the customer service was horrible .
i would have rather drove the extra _num_ miles to robertos .
was a fan until a bad experience .
mexican restaurant out of rice ?
will not risk this place again .
the food is mediocre .
the meat is a low quality cut .
not skirt steak .
chile relleno was hard .
customer service was not the issue .
over $ _num_ to go through a stock _num_ twin 's carbs ?
they are not low priced ; that is a fact .
huge mistake .
the sandwich was not my fave .
the baked potato was good .
they are very busy and the staff seems irritated to serve you .
this place is old , stale , and just a little bit scary .
it was in no way fresh and i could tell it was going bad .
i took one bite and spit it back out , the taste was horrendous .
_num_ stars if i could .
avoid .
and this place is a prime example where the rating is really deceptive .
it looked like prime rib ... but it tasted exactly like corned beef .
like , i think the beef was actually put in water at some point .
the peas and carrots must have been left soaking from the morning ... horrible .
my husband wouldnt eat his and he loves meat .
he got sick later in night as well .
got ta say i was very disappointed in the food & service .
then the food came & it was disgusting !
they used process cheese slices on top of the omelet & inside it .
this cheese was nasty & ruined the omelet so i could n't eat it .
apparently bacon is not cooked to order here .
because of the low prices you do have to wait a while .
with out us you do n't have s job mrs bartender .
seriously ... who does n't serve food at 10:30 pm on .
total disappointment .
not even an apology presented .
that was really irritating to me .
cheap prices do n't justify the smokey waiting area with fake wait times .
worst casino management in henderson , nevada .
the cheap breakfast does n't provide an alternative like denny 's does .
it tends to be the most expensive gas around .
also , avoid the coffee .
do n't know how they can get coffee wrong , but they do .
i will never return though .
not awful , but i 'd expect better in the area .
absolutely the worst mexican food we have ever had .
immediately , i was put off knowing i was about to sweat through dinner .
otherwise , it would be _num_ star for the food alone .
there was no comparison .
i got my bean , cheese and rice burrito with just my side salad .
well ... there will not be a next time .
very flavorless and just bleh .
there 's better authentic mexican restaurants out there for sure .
try if you like but i do n't recommend .
so after some shopping done , we came in here for lunch .
at that point , i looked at mr b. and said im outta here .
she ordered the chicken fajitas .
she smelled it , then gave me a piece to smell .
not this time .
bad service , bad food .
just all around bad .
the only thing worth mentioning was the chips and salsa .
and it was just ok .
omg disgusting .
really nothing special about it .
came with rice and beans ... pretty standard and again ... flavors were flat .
we paid $ _num_ for _num_ meals with _num_ beers .
side of salsa = $ _num_ .
paid with $ _num_ and they did not offer change .
worst customer service ever !
it was disgusting !
i have never had such awful customer service !
the only decent thing on my plate was the chicken taco .
i did n't realize they were charging me $ _num_ for the bland guacamole .
my server was on her cell phone when she delivered my salsa .
and maybe a little salsa with my quesadilla ?
not impressed with their knowledge or respect for their customer 's time .
i do n't believe they know the definition of an appointment .
how life typically goes , the service is performed and payment follows .
my dental bill went from the thousands to $ _num_ .
it 's too bad that i can not review the doctor .
most miserable vet experience ever .
could not recommend more to stay away from this over priced under care facility .
bad service .
the lady their was totally rude .
was n't helpful and did n't really answer any of my question .
ended up taking my dogs boarding at petsmart for the doggie hotel .
long wait times , with or without an appointment .
taking my furry friends elsewhere .
while visiting friends in henderson , my old dog went downhill .
when he stopped eating , i knew it was time to let him go .
they offered no solution , told me it would be another _num_ hours .
never use this company , they are horrible .
i called immediately and was told a driver was on the way .
my only conclusion is that they simply did n't want to .
snap charged me $ _num_ to let aaa on the lot .
are you kidding me ?
these guys have a contract with vegas metro so they rip you off .
its kinda gross to have to sort raw meat before you cook it .
gross .
turns out they wan na charge me more from what i already paid .
i was more disappointed .
never seen so many unhappy people working in a shop .
the only time i saw any attempt to be friendly was tip time .
it 's mediocre at best .
she 's trying , but there is only so much she can do .
they are supposed to have a driver for the bus .
the man said they have n't done dry cleaning in over _num_ years .
do not use this dentist .
he should have never suggested this in the first place .
no one showed up or even called .
you have to wait _num_ hrs . ''
no thank you .
so disappointing !
a second employee came by with our waters a few minutes later .
the garlic cilantro had zero flavor .
i was really disappointed b/c i like both a lot .
garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household .
the hot good though , but they were very very very very greasy .
more napkins than bww or hooters cant be good in the calorie dept .
the pizza was ok ... i wouldnt go back just for the pizza .
they include gratuity in the bill which was fine .
it was just ok .
nothing special as far as pizza is concerned .
he really did n't even care that we were standing there .
when the waitress finally made it over , she could n't have cared less .
seriously , it was like she was irritated she had to take our order .
save yourself the stress and eat at sunset pizza straight across boulder highway .
their pizza kills johnny mac 's .
was n't terribly impressed .
i 've had it better frozen , out of a box .
there was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza .
no thanks , never again .
the pizza was overly salty , the crust was hard and tasted very bad .
the wings were stringy and had fishy smell .
very bad experience , and definitely not going back .
meat was frozen , not fresh for sure .
no bueno .
i have went there twice in the last _num_ days and am very disappointed .
the first time i had the wings and they were nothing special .
the thing that really blows me away is the prices !
usually i would rate them _num_ .
well tonight we sat for _num_ minutes without anyone checking in us .
wrong .
guess what , they gave our reservation away !
so they gave them our reservation !
she remembered my dad from last time ( i thought that was cool ) .
fried zucchini & sauce rocks .
also , the place is too dark .
needless to say we did n't say `` see ya '' back .
service is horrible .
worst ive seen , probably ever .
place is always packed to the walls busy , regardless of the horrible staff .
guess i struck out , yet again .
i waited _num_ mins or so to even have someone help me .
arrived at my destination to enjoy some high dollar wings and was sadly disappointing .
the watermelon bbq sauce was not very tangy and rather bland .
for the price i was n't too pleased .
how does johnny mac 's have _num_ stars ?
after we finished eating , we wanted more cocktails , but nobody asked .
used to go here weekly with family but no more sadly .
tried again and left again for 3rd try .
try hiring more people so least an order is taken .
once again tried to grab lunch with the family .
delivery service has gone down .
it has been sloppy the last few times .
also they never seem to have their famous sauce for the wings .
the pizza was just so-so .
the place was n't even that busy .
slow service and mediocre pizza .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
we asked for blue cheese but it tasted more like sour ranch dressing .
overall it was a huge disappointment .
i love supporting local companies but some just are n't worth it .
this does n't sound like a special to me , im sorry .
worst service ever .
not some trendy restaurant on the strip .
the antipasto salad , my favorite , now is horrible .
slow service .
horrible place to ever get an oil change .
nice guy , but quality and value were lacking .
but the next shop over the same items come to _num_ to _num_ dollars .
disgusting , filthy store .
do n't refill your propane here .
trust me , just do n't .
apparently , it 's home and garden .
i 've walked up and down this store to have my propane refilled .
i 'm not moving until someone can assist me . ''
and the stupid propane is filled .
i was so annoyed i left without buying what i needed .
i find myself calling _num_ or _num_ times before someone answers .
fortunately , they had almost everything i needed , as expected by walmart .
kinda irritating .
this is n't the first time i 've noticed this .
disclaimer : i do n't like walmart .
the second time , they only had the shampoo .
oh , and the parking lot sucks too .
he has no reason to take anything .
being from san diego i expected great things from this wal-mart .
i go to wal-mart .
parking here is terrible .
people are screaming , letting their dogs out to pee .
employees walk out of store with cigarettes in their mouth .
this walmart is just ok .
they get _num_ stars i will only come here if i must .
i like the cheap prices and variety .
what i hate about every walmart is the people unfortunately .
i hate that they only keep _num_ to _num_ cashiers open .
their customer service is quicker though .
the place needs more staff .
ok this is the worst walmart i have ever seen .
i waited _num_ minutes to get through _num_ people .
the manager call took _num_ minutes and then he put the tape in backwards .
i doubt i 'll be back , yes it was that bad .
why in the hell does this need to be locked up ?
does n't work .
oh yea , you want to dodge having to pay any benefits .
stood in line for _num_ minutes ( no problem .
so i did n't complain .
she was absolutely rude and should be removed from direct contact with customers .
typical henderson trash giving all of henderson a bad wrap .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
$ _num_ for two combo meals .
_num_ minute wait for day old fries and sloppy sandwiches .
do n't waste your money here , i wo n't be back .
and after eating i waited _num_ minutes to get a bag .
_num_ minutes after ordering and still do n't have our food .
_num_ others have gotten theirs and left .
on duty manager was nowhere to be found to even lodge a complaint .
ca n't believe this location is still around .
ordered _num_ french dips with curly fries .
should have went to sonic .
they 're just like whatever who cares i have no integrity .
it 's just sad .
it 's too bad this is the only location anywhere near our home .
terrible service and food was no bueno as well .
i 've been sitting in this drive through for nearly _num_ minutes .
plus i dont know what i should think about the weird smell .
this movie theater is complete bullshit .
they like to rip people off and dont give refunds ... .
the worst part was the way they handled this situation .
no manners .
i can not believe the way we were treated here .
this is completely wrong of them .
all of the employees were extremely disrespectful to us .
i did not even have a manger talk to me .
first time going in and customer service at the snack bar was horrible !
not clean and the employees are so rude .
i sent my kids with thier _num_ year old sister .
my kids are _num_ _num_ and _num_ .
my _num_ year old has taken my kids to a rated r movie before .
disgusting place and disgusting service .
people who overheard the conversation while in line were disgusted .
stay away if you want to be treated like a criminal .
rude employees .
called for bee problem .
he does n't introduce himself , no card , nothing .
the service technician who came to my house was arrogant and rude .
never will give them my business again .
they told me the owner was on vacation .
now it is a big headache .
you ca n't trust this florist .
i 'm literally standing outside of their door as i 'm typing this .
their open sign was on , the hours are posted on their window .
please turn off your open sign if you 're closing early for the day .
there was no sign or anything that indicated they were closed .
cash only , even for large orders ( funeral ) .
nothing huge was wrong , but needed to get it taken care of .
absolutely horrible experience .
so , i drove around and waited two hours .
these guys are sloppy and crooks .
oh just come in on this day , i 'll be here till five .
lol then when u go `` oh now 's not a good time .
worst auto parts junk yard ever !
1st off , they only had one working bowling lane .
out of the _num_ there , only _num_ worked .
they had terrible customer service .
no wonder this place is struggling .
it is an old smoke hole that smells like old grease .
do n't waste your time .
their drive thru service at night is horrible .
i 'm never going back to that place .
ugh .
so disappointed .
the fries were just meh .
not crispy enough for my liking .
does n't deserve any stars .
the lack of respect from management is pitiful .
they do n't follow their health code what so ever .
so gross !
we ordered _num_ spicy chicken meals , _num_ bucks .
get it home , ugh the meat was brown .
just ordered a homestyle chicken sandwich .
had bad lettuce on it .
there are _num_ of us .
though there was a video camera , it does not have audio .
yes , the ladies that worked at the front are not very friendly .
one of them has very poor etiquette .
she does n't treat you like patients , more like a sore thumb .
hate this office , would not recommend anyone to come here .
you horrible people .
i can not stand the women up at the front office .
matter of fact , my husband stopped going because of them .
well with that being said , they just lost three patients again .
while dr. grant is great , his staff is rude .
it 's the way he said it that rubbed me the wrong way .
he made me feel like it was such an inconvenience .
it 's not that difficult .
rude staff !
unfortunately , his staff in the front office is terrible .
i picked out another pair , which she also said she disliked on me .
it made me very hesitant and nervous about receiving my new glasses .
i just replied that it was okay , i still wanted it anyway .
she then asked me , `` well , why ? ''
you wo n't be able to order anything , you know . ''
i did n't know why he was telling me this .
so inappropriate .
( i am _num_ ) .
and so inappropriate to compare his patient to her ?
what a nightmare to have gone here , wasted time and wasted money !
my dad had an appointment at 9:30 and promptly arrived on time .
apparently the appointment was supposed to be at 8:30 and not 9:30 .
the other gentleman that works there is a little strange , but friendly .
everything that had happened is not the reason why i am writing this review .
the list goes in .
he 's not friendly like anna and he raised the price .
out of respect to anna i wo n't go into anymore details .
could n't pass this one up .
ate _num_ of _num_ of them , against my better judgement .
yea , they were that bad .
no thanks !
the staff is lazy .
the menu is pretty plain and you get what you pay for .
they also put too much gravy on the pot roast .
_num_ craps table ?
just about every section , other department stores do better .
this is a little less than desirable , and a major health hazard .
staff are becoming noticeably younger and with that noticeably less helpful .
what an excuse for a store !
i had a terrible experience !
going through his line was the only good part of my experience at kmart .
plus , that boss of their 's is awful .
she did n't greet me at all .
first she looked up my kmart card .
some of us just are n't card people .
i again explained it was a gift , i did n't purchase it myself .
it 's $ _num_ .
i do n't want money back .
i do n't need to be treated like a criminal .
not that i 'll shop at other kmart stores , i wo n't .
this policy is ridiculous .
today was a hungover , let 's get some cheap pizzas kinda of day .
not as cheesy as i would like them to be .
a lot of sauce and the crust was dry .
worst deep dish of any little caesars pizza in greater las vegas .
hot & ready pizzas are never ready to go at this location .
hot and ready does n't apply to this location !
stopped at little caesars on the way home .
he said he would get me _num_ fresh pies .
waited _num_ min .
was old .
except this one .
well i guess it is little caesars so you can not expect much .
disappointing overall .
i even have to wait for the hot and read pizzas .
there are not living up to the name .
i wo n't get into the arguing any further , it 's too frustrating .
this was plain and simple stealing .
i chose to just get the `` better '' oil change .
sun valley never told me this .
they also explained synthetic oil to me .
it cost $ _num_ for the bulb and labor .
but at sun valley it would have been more than $ _num_ !
insane business practices .
do not go to sun valley they charge more for the same services !
i come in needing a smog check .
fails .
how stupid .
i paid my service fee and left slightly worried .
i paid my service fee and left slightly worried .
thank you for making your shop look worse .
they claim to be open _num_ days a week from _num_ am to midnight .
i had my car towed in last saturday around 5:00 pm .
the customer service here was terrible , getting estimate is very hard .
do n't waste your time like i did .
they had it for about _num_ hours .
pulled over , to see transmission fluid pouring from the bottom .
called them immediately and had it towed back to the shop that evening .
wo n't be coming back here .
please avoid this place at all costs !
rip off artists at sun valley .
my experience : went in for an oil change .
the guy was a terrible liar , btw .
with a labor rate of $ _num_ per hour , why be so greedy ?
how can people be such terrible humans ?
lots if people like these jerks in las vegas from what i 've heard .
i will not use this shop ever again .
if you want a late night smog check , do n't bother .
he said i could leave my car overnight if i wanted to .
people do n't leave their car for a smog check .
they go someplace , wait _num_ minutes , and then leave .
do not use this business .
- star would be a better rating .
this shop is the worst !
when i received my car back , i still did n't have breaks .
when i received my car back , i still did n't have brakes .
the brake system was entirely gone .
if it had been replaced the gas tank would have had to been pulled .
also , i was charged for a smog that was never done .
do not come to this spot at all !
only reason i stopped by because they were open till midnight .
very sketchy and seems like they are out to just get your money !
i 'd definitely think twice if you 're looking for trustworthy service .
it took almost _num_ minutes for the verdict to come back.
there is never a `` honest '' mechanic .
i ca n't believe this place is still in business .
i am a local resident , not from la .
apparently he failed to tell his staff .
i 've been going to sun valley for probably _num_ years .
will not be returning for service from this shop .
when i got the repair quote it was _num_ .
online , mechanics said it should be a _num_ hour fix .
i will not be returning .
however , i hate it .
there is only one atm , and it is n't even a drive thru .
what a mistake .
part of this is my fault .
as a small business person i do n't have the time to do that .
i called and they told me , in effect , to go screw myself .
you are a fool if you do business with these people .
stations casino closed this dive _num_ weeks ago after closing the cafe months ago .
just found out got ripped off from this place .
security at the place is less than desirable .
by the time we noticed it the damage was done .
customer service was spotty and slow .
i bought a phone i did not want by accident .
( my bad , had the same name as my last one ) .
the company apparently has no consideration for their customers .
not recommended at all unless you need something important in the now .
they were very rude and not friendly .
i left , went to other ups store who gladly helped me !
i have to use this store sometimes because of its location but never again !
the woman that runs this store is extremely rude and has no people skills !
they nickel and dime you and are very rude at the same time .
however , do not expect quality , care or any kind of customer service .
i was inside for over _num_ minutes waiting for my order .
they did n't plan for the rush and there were no fries ready .
i only like coming her because my daughter likes mcdonalds .
why bother here anymore .
when we got home and the order was incorrect i was pissed .
no straws , no napkins and no ketchup through drive thru ?
just do n't get it .
so than you are stuck in line to pull through .
just get me my chocolate milk dude !
and why was i allowed into apparent construction zone ?
disgusting .
i practically screamed at the speaker and they still ca n't hear me ?
apparently , i was there for too long .
according to the owner , this is always bad business .
it 's been _num_ for _num_ since i 've been keeping track .
terrible .
rude .
they would not accept coupons .
no smiles .
they are obviously onto some terrible service .
worst place ever !
if i could give them no stars or a negative i would .
$ _num_ cheaper !
i could not believe this !
`` what the hell ? ''
the fact that i have to give one star is very unfortunate .
horrible doctor ... .
that was the service he did n't deserve .
i could have bought a new one with lifetime warranty for $ _num_ .
with installation it was $ _num_ .
ridiculous .
he had to get angry to fix his back.
$ _num_ to adjust the toe on my truck !
rude , rude , rude .
first of all , this place was very hot , temperature wise .
second , the place was far from clean .
everything about this process was just asking for an infection .
really bad customer service .
worst customer service ever .
rude , condescending , and lacking in basic communication skills .
i call walker company speak to tim who was extremely rude .
tim is extremely rude very unprofessional and probably should n't be in customer service .
rude and greedy to a fault .
so , the employees were pretty much useless here .
i did n't find the actual store to be bad .
the customer service is terrible !
no thanks have a nice day , or anything .
the service department at this location is terrible .
ca n't get any information from them and no one seems to really care .
no useful information and no helpful advice .
i change a bulb and still nothing .
no let 's take a look , nothing .
horrible experience for me .
are you kidding me ?
they did credit us our $ _num_ back .
why did n't you discuss that with me or my dad ?
on tuesday morning , i arrived at vca black mountain to get the prescription .
dee dee again stated what she said on the voice mail .
since we are leaving in two days , this was very helpful information .
b/c i do n't know why i even bother setting up an appt .
was terrible .
no apologies were really given either .
totally unacceptable !
wish i would have read the reviews before coming to this place .
all that for $ _num_ !
that was the biggest mistake i made ... !
they have the worst groomers !
the only reason i gave them _num_ star because of the vet i saw .
she gave him options and gave him a time limit of _num_ weeks .
of course , it was all about the money again .
for them it is not about your pet but about your wallet .
horrible experience with dr lisa ( did n't catch her last name ) .
dee at the front desk has a terrible , unfriendly , unwelcoming attitude .
his business could be so much better without the dead weight .
the rooms sit empty .
i do n't even think i would return if we had an emergency .
and the next thing you know its been two hours .
not anymore .
i was fed up enough this time to come home and write this review .
sick animals are alone from _num_ pm until 6:30 am .
i will not be going back to this office .
say something - anything so i 'm not blatantly being ignored .
well not on my dog you do n't .
she told me she had been doing it a long time .
pathetic in this day and age .
so i am extremely aware of what average prices on his meds .
the most i 've ever paid for this shot was _num_ .
what a huge disappointment because i liked the dr .
not exactly sure the reason but i got dusty dogs back .
i only experienced _num_ of _num_ ( friendly professional staff ) .
the woman gave me a quote of $ _num_ total .
no reply to that ... .
i just would like to warn all you pet owners about this place .
the normal groomer we used was not available so another gal groomed my dog .
he does n't want to move or be touched .
i ca n't imagine how they would treat a new customer .
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
this is a business built on profit , not animal care .
i ca n't believe this place is still operating .
i was gone longer then i thought .
i did n't have enough money to cover the two extra days .
i will be taking my dog to my vet to be checked out .
i will not go here again !
you 're a dog boarding place your job is to board the dogs !
do n't waste your money here .
i 've been using the same veterinarian for four years and trust their diagnosis .
she told me that customers are not allowed back there on the holiday .
no reply .
they obviously prefer small dogs and cats and should state that on their website .
they get two stars only because of their friendly staff .
the owners are older and are ill equipped to deal with large breed dogs .
he certainly is not a people person but a nasty person .
how do you know what i drive and where i live , is creepy .
it 's no secret your rude .
place is not appealing in appearance or smell .
the dogs are obviously stressed and scared .
save your money , go to the shelter .
bad service ... .
paid $ _num_ for an arrangement delivered to my mom .
what a shame !
some of the flowers were n't open and were forced open by hand .
it was awful .
go to antique rose down the road .
this was the rudest most unprofessional lady i had ever met .
this was the rudest most unprofessional lady i had ever met .
do n't use this place !
nothing like what appeared in the pictures .
in addition , they were delivered late when i had requested morning delivery .
i feel ripped off .
totally disappointed to see the flowers they advertised online compared to the finished product !
took my cc # , sent me a confirmation , thought all was good .
terrible service .
it is very bad course .
it 's small and cheap .
nothing special about this course at all .
greens are hard , dont hold anything .
every hole is straight and flat , nothing really interesting going on .
i 'd play elsewhere unless you really are on a budget .
the green fee is dirt cheap .
if the other _num_ holes were still open it would be higher .
if there was a zero stars , we would have chosen it .
this course is in awful condition .
black mountain fairways are more like rough and the rough is worse .
personally i like mcdonald 's better .
the chicken strips were good .
it 's not that it 's terrible .
no go .
sure enough , i saw other drivers tipping her .
apparently it is n't just me who does n't get it .
hell , i even think the burgers at del taco are tastier .
this is one place where the hype far exceeds the reality .
it tasted like our sink water more than anything else .
visited today and experienced the same issue - slush tasted off .
lacking .
will not return because management will not accept certain coupons !
and he was very rude !
food is terrible , complete lack of flavor .
did n't even get cherries in my cherry limeade !
customer service was not that great .
i wish he had taken my simple order instead of katie .
do not waste your time .
im not coming here ever again .
they ca n't get an order right for the life of them .
these people never and i mean never get it right .
never do they get it right .
bad management .
he spent over _num_ hour and said it was a switch .
why come on a saturday if you ca n't fix anything .
( they recently relocated ) .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get here .
i was really upset considering i also tipped $ _num_ to the driver .
he then proceeded to yell at me and tell me that i was wrong .
i was completely offended .
i will never eat or order from this villa pizza again .
_num_ lil fingers and a handful of fries for $ _num_ .
i wont make that mistake again .
some people have stated the pizza is not bad .
i may try the pizza buffet just to get my money back .
the main reason for the poor review though is the owners .
they did not seem inviting or welcoming at all .
i felt like i was doing something wrong each time i went back .
the manager jr is a flat out liar and is shady !
very disappointed in the service here .
very unsatisfied customer !
i am visiting las vegas with a show playing the smith center downtown .
she did n't return my call until almost 4pm the next day .
when i asked her if the doctor could recommend an associate she refused .
when i asked for a recommendation for a dermatologist , she also refused .
just do n't find him easy to talk to on a patient level .
my advice : do not trust this guy .
just go to a different doctor , because it may severely damage your health .
been seeing dr. johnson for the last _num_ years .
never loved him , he was just convenient .
not anymore .
i would rate them _num_ stars before dr johnson switched to dignity health .
i would really like to rate them a zero in customer service .
ordered the steak and eggs and a chop steak .
we wo n't be going back .
it was bland and dry .
we went there every monday night almost last year for monday night football .
she said nothing .
the potato chips they gave out were stale .
i tasted one , it was so bad .
they have really gone downhill .
a no smoking section makes no difference , the whole places reeks of smoke .
i would never waste my money or time in here again .
all in all , the food was ok and the service sucked .
should have gone to olive garden .
ok , the thing about this place used to be value .
sadly things seem to have changed .
the meal is just ok for the money .
i guess old vegas is gone for good .
i had not heard anything and so _num_ days ago started calling .
i am backed up and can not get to it .
my money is not good enough ?
number three : you `` will not charge '' me for storage ?
i would give them a zero if i could .
i have tenants freezing in my rental property and she could care less .
she said no so i hung up .
i am not impressed with their food , taco bell is far better .
this was the most bizarre del taco experience i 've ever had .
i ate as quickly as i could and left .
only been here a few times in the late wee hours .
the graveyard shift crew is a little iffy .
the plaza it 's in is uber creepy at night .
it was pretty lousy .
mine was good but there just was n't enough of it .
_num_ pieces of lemon chicken on the plate just left me wanting more .
the cashew chicken had good flavor but was not very appealing to the eye .
the chicken looked like it was boiled .
the food was ok ... just ok ... barely ok .
no , really .
this place is horrible .
if i didnt have to give it a star , i wouldnt .
tried one bite of the fried rice and had to spit it out .
it was just nasty .
if youre looking for chinese food , dont go here .
this place was nasty which reflects there dirty food .
undercooked shrimp fried rice and sweet & sour chicken .
life is way too good to risk and waste time on this place .
i was very disappointed .
my lunch was super sweet , just terrible tasting .
my wife ate her 's which was a just meat and a little better .
the meat was sloppy with sauce .
the general chicken was literally fried skin and no meat .
_num_ bucks down the drain .
please do n't waste your money on this place !
the older staff was friendly and knew the old time customers .
even after months of not showing up they would know what i wanted .
i said , ok i 'll just have the lo mein .
so i thought i 'd just came on a bad day .
she said it does n't come with vegetables without garlic .
not a pretty picture .
not a pretty picture and i do n't eat much .
so i asked for a to-go box for my dogs .
i grew up here , and visited this place frequently during high school days .
nothing like it used to be .
was the only customer in there the whole time .
same with the egg roll , nothing out of ordinary .
the orange chicken was ok , little watery .
dont remember any meat , and definitely no scrambled egg .
maybe was just a bad day for them , not sure .
atmosphere was more reminiscent of a cafe than a chinese restaurant .
worst haircut i have ever had .
i did n't even know they did that .
i did n't even know they did that .
they were willing to keep the money though .
my first _num_ star .
not one of my best decisions but one i will have to live with .
i will not go back ... ever !
food was also bland and tasted old .
too bad .
had it been more crispy , i would have enjoyed it more .
beef with oyster sauce for $ _num_ ( large ) - msg also included .
i did n't care for the breading on the chicken .
not good .
last night i did n't want fast food .
that 's when china joes saved the day to feed my hunger .
dont waste your money , you will be disappointed !
my wife and i got sick from the food prepared from this restaurant .
what a waste of my money .
horrible food .
keep yourself healthy and do n't eat there .
you 've been warned .
oil was old tasting .
pork egg rolls were the worst i have tasted , maybe the oil .
cashew chicken ... yes _num_ items .
soup egg drop was ok.
let 's just say $ _num_ down the drain o well lesson learned !
the egg roll i recieved was old : ( .
the second day we dropped her off was a practice run for us .
my wife picked her up after _num_ hours .
she did n't realize anything was wrong until she changed her at home .
she stayed several minutes to see if the other person came in .
i did n't want this apartment by choice and my roommate did .
alright , no big deal .
i see bugs everywhere it 's disgusting .
disgusting !
disappointing , do yourself a favor and save yourself the stress !
i wish i could give it zero stars !
should n't you know this ?
our upstairs neighbors are horribly rude .
they never leave the house .
the community is quiet that is the only good thing about this place .
they even dropped $ _num_ of the bill to help out .
what a disaster and a joke .
i was confused by this , so i asked to speak with steve .
steve never called back !
you are the owner and you ca n't figure out your own pricing ?
with no issues .
as i was telling the above story , the guy just smiled at me .
the second hand smoke was abysmal .
it 's not a casino i usually seek out .
drinks are cheap and the bars are not shabby .
my friend is having there $ _num_ beer specials .
this place needs to get there shit straight .
just service the customers the tips will come .
poor service !
got nothing but nasty looks the entire time .
very unfriendly staff , what little of it there was .
horrible customer service !
the food was hot , served quickly , but lacking in character or flavor .
food was crap .
no vegetables .
disgusting , boring , blah food .
for my family lotus is off our list of possible options .
the decor is pretty tacky and can be a bit gross at times .
i think he was just uncomfortable at how unprofessional they appeared , but whatever .
their rice and chicken also needed some more spice to it .
ugh .
food was decent and the restaurant looked like it needed remodeling several decades ago .
very disappointed !
so then we get our food and everything tastes like day old and reheated !
the rice was dry and hard .
the chow mein was also dry and hard .
i have been coming here for over _num_ years .
i cant imagine eating worse food !
terrible is their name and its for a reason .
$ _num_ for a gallon of milk .
i was disappointed .
what they call `` spuds '' are mushy oily thick potato chips .
there is plenty to eat , only what there is is n't good .
their bacon is nothing to brag about either .
i wo n't be back .
we went yesterday for lunch and was very disappointed .
do not get the fried zucchini ... .
horrible !
spuds are gross too .
nothing special at lunchtime .
cracked egg is way better and so is egg and i .
the service was not good either .
maybe they were just having a bad day i do n't know .
but we will not go back anytime soon .
service is awful .
waited over _num_ minutes just to have our order taken .
there were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us .
this is hands down the worst breakfast place ever .
i used to live right next to it and gave it several chances .
every time i got an omelette the veggies would still be hard and raw .
i got huevos rancheros which you could tell the sauce was canned and awful .
so far everything i have tasted is disgusting .
this place is so gross .
went to the one at boulder and russell .
the service was nonexistent .
the spuds must have been several days old .
the # _num_ omelet was just ok .
i will not go back to this one .
i 'm just not a huge fan .
way too much spinach .
very thick hollandaise , but not very tasty .
this morning however , i had a very bad customer service experience .
when we walked in , we were seated immediately .
the cashier jenny was extremely rude !
then she was very rude when she asked how we wanted pt split it .
they were not very sorry for the inconvenience at all .
for a small place you would think they would care a little more .
so if you do n't carry cash this is not a place for you .
food was cold , stale , and looked like it had sat for awhile .
also , service was bad .
i wo n't return here again .
told the wait would be _num_ - _num_ minutes .
waited _num_ minutes .
told _num_ more minutes .
sketchy !
it tasted like liver .
never went back .
i do n't even know what to say .
this was our 6th time here , and sadly our last .
must not be in the cards for us to eat out today .
they were brought their drinks and immediately had their order taken .
so disappointing .
brought the family in ( _num_ of us ) and was seated almost immediately .
none of my refills were hot .
ugh .
avocado seemed wrong and out of place .
stuffed french toast : _num_ yr old loved it .
no one ate theirs .
whatever they were supposed to be , they did n't taste good .
yes , portions are big but quality is low .
seriously this is basic diner fare nothing to rave about or be amazed with .
any decent person would have simply said excuse me .
the prices are a little pricy depending on what you order .
you ca n't even stretch your legs or arms .
try going to the `` egg and i '' instead .
nothing like the other location .
service was poor , bathrooms were in need of attention .
eggs were not over easy and had to go back .
will not return even on everything is free day !
it was literally stuck in the cheese in my eggs .
we said no and that we just did n't want it .
i guess people just go there for the food and not the bad service.
i have never had such terrible service while getting a pedicure before .
nothing but putting it down .
and only _num_ hours later my nail polish is chipped !
terrible !
i also over paid for such a terrible job done .
i would never go back again .
it is by far the worst salon i have ever been to .
recently walked in to an empty salon yet could not get services .
it was made clear that my custom was no longer desired .
not my favorite place .
the quality is n't worth coming here .
beware of fake reviews below as well !
this is the worst mani pedi i have ever had .
total time was less than _num_ minutes .
this is a terrible place !
i felt so sorry for my mother who was visiting me .
people were rude !
water was cold !
i will warn them ... never to go back !
terrible !
pedicure was about _num_ minutes .
not very good .
they were sloppy .
the hot dog was less then ordinary .
he was rude and ruined my desire for even wanting to go back .
the service was terrible .
bad thing is he doesnt accept any other form of payment accept cash .
very rude and if you dont ask for napkins you will not get them .
continuously having attitude to customers , he must hate his life .
thing after thing proved a rude clerk .
the hot dogs are ok.
service is terrible .
honestly the hotdogs at costco are better and you do n't get attitude .
in fact too small for their $ _num_ price .
french fries were better than most .
man where do i start ?
every employee there is a jerk .
good food this place never misses , drop in and have a dog .
cash only businesses should know they have to make change .
it 's not my fault you were n't prepared .
customer lost .
and the fire dog was way overcooked .
dudes ego reeks big time .
the bill was $ _num_ .
definitely nothing overly special .
the prices are too high for such a small dog and sausage .
the guy at the window is rude .
the italian beef for _num_ lacks the real condiments .
it 's not green bell peppers and jalapeos .
that 's not chicago that 's mexico .
sorry taking my _num_ else where .
and it 's because your lacking honesty about the food .
it makes me sad that the quality has been given up on .
this is not a place i will be going back to anymore .
i wo n't be recommending this place anymore which is sad .
first time stop and wo n't be back !
do n't waste your time .
i 've given them many chances , but every time i get burned .
this place is alright they really have no competition in the area .
not impressed with this place .
i might as well make a hotdog at home .
the owner was nice but the price is ridiculous .
heads up that they 're cash only and do n't have covered seating available .
this was my first visit to hot dog heaven .
simply hot dogs , italian beef sandwiches , and fries .
this was my first time trying italian beef and it was not good .
the hot dog and fries were typical and a satisfactory quick lunch .
the fries were thick like steak fries .
hot dog heaven , attitude and hot dogs .
ugh .
i regret not telling her no .
_num_ star is _num_ star too many .
i would recommend going to another location to get your kfc .
ugh !
_num_ pm and they have no breasts of chicken and none cooking .
these people are clueless .
they really do n't deserve even one star .
i bought a _num_ piece bucket and added _num_ more breasts to my order .
did n't receive corn when i got my order got two mac n cheeses .
but this is n't about messing up my order this is much much worse .
these pieces of chicken were so bad .
the breasts were the suspicious pieces i 'm talking about .
not even edible .
i did n't bother going back to tell them because i was furious .
i would have gone too crazy down there .
they were not very busy at all .
i ordered and my order was repeated to me .
_num_ . )
i refuse to go back to that location .
the worst kfc ever .
this place does not have it together !
horrible service !
it 's a kfc that never has chicken .
their thing is supposed to be chicken and they never actually have any chicken .
who owns this crap hole ?
stood at the counter for about _num_ minutes .
the last few months it has been terrible .
there should be negative stars allowed for places such as this one .
it took me _num_ minutes to drop off my prescription this morning .
it took _num_ minutes to pick it up this afternoon .
they 've been getting worse over the years .
by far the worst pharmacy on this side of town .
constantly late on prescriptions and long wait times during key hours of operation .
this pharmacy is a complete joke !
the employees are rude and disrespectful .
t hole .
need to get new managers & staff to run this place .
horrible people at the pharmacy !
_num_ hours to fill the script , then _num_ minutes more to add flavoring ?
look at the history of bad reviews .
staff is super slow and not customer friendly .
and this is not the first time .
terrible service and i do n't even think they care about there reviews .
there was no apology or care they had lost a patient .
i feel the office staff could of been more apologetic .
never again will henderson hyundai be giving me a car from this place .
excuse me after what i just went through ... .
place is just bad .
i will just have to wait it out at the rainbow next time .
did i mention there were only _num_ other occupied tables ?
this is not a good casino to win nor eat at .
the food is overpriced primarily they do not get enough business .
this is the 2nd time this has happened in this establishment .
the first time i let it slide thinking it was a fluke .
she checked someone out , then walked to the cage .
very disappointed in the customer service we received .
this dollar tree now sells expired items .
i looked in the back and saw the expiration date was _num_ april _num_ !
if you buy food there check the expiration date before buying .
never has ice cream cones / shakes half of the time .
worst fast food service in the world !
do n't go there the food is under cooked .
she told me that she would have my total at the window .
why wait to tell me ?
just a pet peeve of mine , i guess .
seriously , gross .
it tasted more like a bad hazelnut flavor to me .
worst burger king i 've ever been to .
so i just left because obviously they did n't have time for me !
food has always been awesome no complaints .
my first thought is yay after a _num_ hour work day on a airplane .
made my order she said _num_ mins .
perfect i thought as i am only 5-10 mins away .
i drive straight there and walk in and it is extremely busy .
i decided i will just grab my salsa and let them catch up .
i get to register i told her sorry i walked in they were busy .
but she continued and continued to be mad in front of other customers .
i asked for managers name and she refused .
nothing special .
one of my favorite restaurant until they gave me spoiled burritos .
very disappointed .
has anyone noticed that the quality has gone way down recently ?
the carne asada has almost no flavor .
the chips taste like they 've been cooked in old , stale oil .
the meat is either undercooked , or past its prime .
chicken in the tacos tasted like jerky , with a stale shell .
this needs to get better .
did n't make me ever want to go back .
just eh .
lady at the registers was kind of rude .
when i got my food it was not the combo .
i left without the rest of my food .
she confirmed that she wanted the burrito and he said yes , $ _num_ .
the cash register still said $ _num_ .
no receipt to confirm .
if i could them zero stars i would .
i 've tried it like _num_ times just to be sure it sucks lol .
there tortillas are soggy and they never put any bacon in the breakfast burritos .
i got like _num_ pieces in my whole burrito .
i 'm never going back .
it 's not the food ... it 's the customer service .
the girl working the counter is mean as hell .
she 's having a bad day .
not worth the attitude .
this place has permanently lost my business .
it 's not that far .
i purchased almost $ _num_ in flowers from the shop for valentines day _num_ .
worst experience ever !
i spend $ _num_ on _num_ salt city candles .
i have my receipt and it was barely burned .
this is the worst customer service ever !
along with the fact that they have no signs on their return policy .
called _num_ week before the flowers were to be delivered .
i will not be ordering from this location again .
we will not order from there again .
( open air ) no wonder they are wilted !
then she says , `` do n't worry .
i walked out i was so pissed .
ridiculous !
plus , _num_ of the lily 's were n't even open .
i recommend you spend your money elsewhere .
i guess this company does n't need my business .
but once again i did not get an email or a follow up call .
other failed attempts , waste of time !
no show !
it really may be the worst _num_ hour in the city .
very disappointing .
they just lost my drop in fee and any future visits .
the food ( breakfast ) was just not right .
this was definitely a miss .
cheap but food tasted weird .
would not go back .
we found this hole in the wall spot and we were really excited .
they only have basic breakfast food and sandwiches .
the guy behind the counter was an older gentleman and not particularly friendly .
the guy kept staring at us , no smile , nothing .
i will never return to this place if this man is behind the counter .
coffee was awful , tasted like dirt .
breakfast sandwiches were just ok.
i am soo disappointed !
ordered the super bird to go and i was utterly disgusted .
i was so disappointed i payed for it .
i will not go back .
ugh .
i still have a terrible taste from it .
for my fall maintenance yesterday , i feel that i was scammed .
i turned up the thermostat from _num_ to _num_ .
no heat .
no problem since .
additionally , sunset auto does not work on tires .
every single time they did , my car was damaged .
i suppose $ _num_ must have gone to the hispanic shop .
$ _num_ ( after _num_ % aaa discount ) for a simple oil change !
upon getting my bill $ _num_ , i was disappointed .
let me explain why i was disappointed .
i wish you all better experiences while shopping for a mechanic .
i got them both changed at advanced muffler for _num_ .
and it was n't a transmission or a major engine problem .
they have lost this customer which really wanted to stay .
work performed on my jeep was not acceptable .
disappointed .
the clerk was not the least bit friendly .
she grabbed donuts from the back .
there was no `` sorry about that '' nothing .
drove _num_ miles in rush hour traffic to satisfy my craving .
this place is out of the way .
i 'm all about cleanliness so i was n't feeling that at all .
maybe my nyc tastebuds have turned me into a donut snob .
this place maybe just a little too plain for me .
maybe they have a better selection in the morning hours .
if this is the best in the area ... i 'm in trouble .
when i first got in they had barely any donuts .
the place is dirty and not worth it .
they had a very poor selection at the time i went .
so sad .
i was very disappointed .
only gave a star because i could n't post otherwise .
so no more _num_ cent roulette and no more $ _num_ blackjack .
might be the best thing .
this place is terrible !
slow service , below average food .
stayed at this hotel during a quick overnight trip to the henderson area .
that was not what i reserved .
it was too late to find anywhere else to stay .
beware new owners has gone to dump two days .
don ' t waste your money !
worst breakfast buffet i 've experienced .
rubber eggs and potatoes .
run down and obviously not being kept up .
there was hair on the sink .
i was exhausted so stayed in this special room .
do not stay here .
i walked into the lobby and it was so stuffy and hot .
had a horrible time staying here .
the staff was very unfriendly .
the hot tub was broken .
the pool room was ice cold .
i gave a star because she did let us check in early .
worse hotel every .
i was on the _num_ rd floor near the elevator the worse ever .
plus the carpet as filthy and staff was so rude .
the pros : the bed was comfortable .
the staff is not particularly friendly .
i will never stay in this hotel chain again .
this place sucks and they lie .
i 'd never heard of this before , but i was disappointed and left .
over the next three days i got _num_ more calls from the collections department .
more than a month goes by and i do not receive my check .
i was told i should get the check next week .
i can not recommend this business at all .
i have to tell you no , they could n't handle it .
do n't know why they wo n't do it here in the desert .
when i set up account i noted dogs and gates locked .
he calls and finds out that that 's included but has no seed .
so he says he 'll come back in few days with seed .
_num_ hours later another guys comes over and says he is there to spray .
so he says we should spray .
next day i called home office and asked to have super call me .
that was _num_ weeks ago and no one has called .
these guys are idiots .
there is no customer service there .
i told him i 'm not worried about it right now .
he was still yelling thru the door .
the people in the local las vegas office are completely incompetent and apathetic .
what an awful experience !
stay far away from this company !
what i witnessed here was an absolute nightmare .
they asked me what was wrong upon my entering and i explained .
my dr. came in just to play angry birds on his cell phone .
is n't this a hospital ?
you ca n't tell me if my baby is ok or not ?
if i could leave zero stars i would .
and complaining he could n't breathe .
my dad is in the hospital now and not in good condition .
thanks st. rose once again for nothing .
the building it 's self is extremely old and in need if repairs .
the worse i 've seen and heard .
the experience ranged from fantastic , to horrible .
he also called some of the patients on this floor vegetables .
nick needs to get over himself .
my mother was dying .
i was left out in the waiting room for a hour with unbelievable pain .
the front office receptionist was talking and laughing .
suffering and uncomfortable .
like i said i have worked in healthcare for over _num_ years .
i would not take my dog to this place .
in my opinion this is not a non profit operation but a total fraud .
bad decision .
they do n't have enough classes for the number of students they have .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
she was very condescending and would not give me the time of day .
very rude people , a director that takes no appointments to discuss issues .
people that have been long term residents having to prove they are resident .
there extremely slow , and it 's cold bring a jacket !
they handle their money terribly .
money money money .
sometimes service will go on for _num_ minutes before jesus is mentioned .
i saw other reviews comparing church to a concert , and it really was .
the lights went down , and it was hard to find a seat .
awesome coffee ( starbucks copy ) shop .
very impersonal at the church unless you are a seasoned volunteer .
but this lady , damn , she needs a hug or something .
chances of me going back ?
no personality at all and overpriced for the lack of service .
employee there have no personality and are rude .
ok , its 1pm and they went to lunch .
1:30 , the place is still closed .
there is a subway _num_ feet away .
it took _num_ people to go to lunch for at least _num_ minutes .
unbelievable poor customer service .
the older man that is there now is unfriendly and so difficult to understand .
`` cash only '' does not work for me .
i just started here and the administration is a mess .
if you want to avoid the added stress of college do not go here !
so yeah -- no hipsters here at nevada state .
this place is pathetic enough to be even called a college .
however , its degree offerings are limited .
and/or want the traditional college experience , then look elsewhere for that .
i 'm glad i avoided this bad relationship before i got to far in .
absolutely ridiculous policy .
i might as well have spent that to take the class at unlv .
i 'd rather spend the extra money and go elsewhere .
they will ignore you , unless you walk in with a suit .
shame on the company for having this pathetic staff no customer service whatsoever .
needless to say i wo n't be returning to this location .
and ca n't complete a phone call .
i 'm so disappointed .
thank god i am out of contract .
very slow service .
not prepared at all for a new device coming out .
i went into this store to upgrade my phone .
they walked out .
this store is not a good example of sprint customer service though .
i left everything up at the register and walked out .
every other thing i picked up today was n't available in my size .
and of course , she was wrong about everything .
i am very sorry about your experience .
i miss my previous agent back in illinois .
i always had country financial and i was hesitant to sign up with state .
i 'm not impressed with the agency .
this is an unethical , unprofessional dental office .
we were also very disappointed with the pricing .
just wish i read the reviews before i came here .
do not go to this dentist !
this guy is fake dentist !
i still have pain in my tooth _num_ one year later !
i know why she quit now !
not impressed .
unfortunately , we signed a contract for braces .
get a text , email , and phone call on thursday .
no sign etc .
there are several other family there waiting as well .
wait about _num_ minutes then go home .
dr. chase told me the pain was temporary .
worst place ever !
i would give this place _num_ stars .
worst dentist ever !
over charging customers and not caring about people in pain !
they do not care about the patients .
i feel that all they really care about is the money .
months went by and i could not eat or drink on my right side .
i woke up in screaming pain .
pricing seems high to me and bedside manner is not the best .
this place should have no stars at all .
called back _num_ times and did not answer !
this place is unprofessional and a rip off !
worst place ever !
the place is so loud .
i could hardly hear what they are asking me .
bad place !
_num_ % higher than my last service this past july .
my husband had the worst experience with this place .
they are awful to work with .
the office staff makes promises and the dentist has no clue .
long story short .
i talked to my dentist and he did n't need a _num_ dollar cleaning .
sadly one of the worst group of people ever at a dentist .
would n't want people with horrible personalities to work on my teeth anyways .
i feel bad for the workers who are truly nice though .
every month there is more money needed .
everyone is confused !
this whole time i 'm being told the dentist would be in shortly .
they assured me _num_ more minutes .
overall , a very frustrating and complete waste of time .
what a shame and a waste of time .
it cost about $ _num_ for fish and chips .
she ate most of it , but lost heart toward the end .
i also tried the cabbage .
i tried the lobster florentine eggs benedict .
it normally comes with hash browns or potatoes , but i got tomato slices .
it was topped with two poached eggs .
my iced tea was $ _num_ .
the beef nachos were something any taco bell could blow away .
but like i said , i 've only been on the dining side .
when we walked in the dining room had about three other groups eating .
ugh .
pet peeve of mine i guess .
bad idea !
and the place was not packed .
but there was only one waiter .
it was insane how poor the place was being run .
i mean i used to serve tables .
just not worth it to eat here .
when we arrived , no one was at the hostess station .
after waiting _num_ minutes , we were told to seat ourselves .
how can a local bar have absolutely zero hh ?
however today i went in with some friends and was n't impressed .
asked for no onions and no mushrooms .
sandwich comes old crusty beef , onion , mushrooms .
this was old food poorly served and incorrectly served .
_num_ min wait to be seated .
_num_ min wait to get order taken .
not cooked enough then overcooked .
left us alone for two hours .
i would never return there again .
this was the worst restaurant experience i have ever come across .
small , pathetic .
and here 's the worst part .
got a couple dollars knocked off my total bill , $ 30+ .
this place has terrible music and an obnoxious bald bartender .
place used to have the best pbr on this side of town .
nice pool table area where the restaurant side used to be .
this place used to have the best steak sandwiches in town .
no thanks i will simply pour my own beer ... ... at home !
i 'm so sad that pt 's has taken over .
i ordered my same order tonight and i got three plastic _num_ oz containers .
the shepherd 's pie looked like someone threw up in a tiny cup .
so sad !
the clerk behind the counter worked with me on the order .
this was not the cake we ordered .
at this point i was extremely upset .
she also could n't confirm if the filling was inside as requested .
in the end , i sent my sister to return the cake .
ultimately i get that it was just a cake .
this cake was awful , from the frosting to the cake .
so annoying .
its also for the lower class customer .
gross .
so obviously this is the store the idiot customers come too as well .
like hello , im literally standing directly behind your car .
the location is n't that great either .
per her words she said `` these are not for you ... ... . ''
no one there knows how to bag and it seems there is no training .
i did n't notice that until i got home .
he never asked for my name and number to leave for the manager .
the people who work in the store are nice but lack common sense .
the produce is terrible as well .
i 'm just glad the associates are friendly .
this is the closest grocery store to my house but i will not return .
first the aisles are extremely crowded , as are the checkout lanes .
i am _num_ months pregnant .
then pushed my cart back , with her other hand on my arm .
extremely rude , extremely unprofessional and so far out of line !
hard to screw up pho for me .
noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality .
supposedly the regulars expect nothing less .
it was these experiences more than the pho that might make me return .
i ordered two pho and _num_ order of egg rolls .
but i was wrong .
i was not offered anything for free to make up for their mistake .
it just did n't taste very good - i really ca n't explain it .
the fried rice was real dark with nothing in it .
this is basically your typical local chinese restaurant .
horrible service !
served me old food !
i sat down for lunch and just started to enjoy my soup .
the ants are n't dead now you just got them closer to the kitchen .
i mentioned that to him but he did n't care .
i have not been there since .
i like the food but i am concerned about the cleanliness of the place .
but they use no one and they should .
the food quality is not consistent .
each time the quality of the food has been getting worst .
we spent $ _num_ including tax .
our container of mongolian beef and white rice was only half full .
i was disappointed and called the restaurant .
we have ordered mongolian beef before and have received a full container .
they were all fat and hardly any meat .
the restaurant also does n't seem clean .
there was no soap or paper towels at all .
came in ordered and everything was ready in ten minutes .
not worth what i paid .
totally gross .
totally disappointed .
this was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last .
and the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy .
usually whenever i get pho , it comes steaming hot .
i told her that was fine , but i didnt want cold soup .
it just looked disgusting .
there was a total lack of service .
there was only one other person during my entire visit .
nobody ever really checked on my table .
and it was hard to get the servers attention when i needed something .
it was hot in there and service was ok.
hot and sour soup is very bitter .
it is almost like it is made of pure sour .
it was mediocre chinese food .
nothing special .
the bad rating comes from the beef .
we would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of our friends and family .
food quality was so down , vegetables were not at all fresh .
spring oil with oil and have no idea what they stuff .
it serves a purpose if you are broke or drunk , and little else .
heavy on the deep fryer and sugary sauce , light on quality .
it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies were n't even tasty .
do not request your order for delivery .
took us almost _num_ hours to get our food and we are still waiting .
very disappointing !
to spring mountain , so i ordered take out at jasmine express .
big mistake .
the onion and bean sprouts were brown and old .
it is a hole in the ground and get worse everytime i visit .
chinese and thai food awful .
and they deliver ( sometimes ) when i 'm super lazy .
# _num_ on the worst chinese fast food list in the country .
the chicken was the cheapest quality a restaurant could buy .
i do n't know why they have the elderly man still making the food .
the food is horrible !
i feel bad because it was my idea to go there !
the food had gotten worst !
i ordered some vietnamese food that i 've been normally ordering .
not even an apology for this aweful meal .
you will be very disappointed !
bad food ... consider this as a warning !
he kept saying well no one else has complained .
do n't get it here .
if a negative review was possible , i would give this restaurant one !
that was a big mistake !
i called the restaurant back and the rude employee answered .
i explained , i would be there shortly .
immediately , the employee felt completely dumb !
over all , the food was ok and nothing out of the ordinary .
yelpers , stay away from this business .
very misleading and disappointing !
it seems tho that the restaurant has either changed owners or cook .
unfortunately it was worse this time .
just a bad experience over all .
no sense to going back for bad food and false advertising .
long story short food was bland and not worth the price .
i highly doubt we will ever visit this establishment again .
i came in on a thursday at _num_ for lunch .
service was horrible .
then i got half of the lunch special about _num_ minutes later .
i was missing the soup and egg roll .
the fried rice was soaked in soy sauce and was n't my favorite .
the thai tea - the main thing i came for was horrible .
it was way too sweet and they had no boba .
i ca n't believe this place has over a _num_ star rating .
the noodles were overly rubbery and felt like they were over cooked .
pad thai mediocre .
spring rolls eh .
only saving grace were the boba drinks .
worst pho i ever had .
definitely a thumbs down .
seriously i 'm not a picky eater at all .
first of all , their sign says hey open at 11am .
the guy took _num_ minutes to come & take my order !
i was already frustrated but was expecting at least good food .
had _num_ bites and i was done !
so disappointed .
they made the soup tom yum soup with shrimp instead of chicken .
my boyfriend tried it and the chicken was so chewy , almost raw !
on the plus side the egg rolls were decent .
i 've been here a few times and i always leave very disappointed .
horrible service and mediocre food .
was not impressed at all .
this place is just sad .
no one should ever go here unless you want to risk your health .
how disgusting !
potstickers were incredibly bland .
i was n't complaining to not pay .
my husband and daughters food were mediocre at best .
bad food , bad service & long wait times .
i do n't understand why it would take so long .
now the people here do n't even say hi or greet you .
he did n't even say anything when he gave me my food .
no ... '' have a nice day '' or thank you ! ''
disappointing .
the bowl itself was ok , chicken was a bit salty .
a lot of rice , not enough chicken , veggies or sauce .
the drinks are n't that bad , but the wait time is ridiculous ?
_num_ minutes for a boba drink .
i would n't recommend eating here now .
got my money back !
they must 've had a dumb new cook today or lazy one .
very disappointing and will never go back .
it says they 'll be open on tuesday but they 're not .
free eggroll with yelp check-in and buy one get one free drink ?
i was disgusted by the rude servers here .
i am done with their trashy and unprofessional employees .
straight to trash .
either way , i could not drink this .
took a sip then went straight to trash .
boba was a disgusting mush and had absolutely no flavor or chew .
avoid at all cost .
terrible customer service .
i signed up for their reward card and loyalty program .
buy _num_ get the 10th boba drink free .
i reached my 10th drink in less than _num_ days .
the service became so disgusting as time went on .
do n't waste your money on these people .
i 'll drive _num_ minutes across town before i support businesses like this .
dinning room and bathroom was also dirty again .
tonight was the last time i will ever come here .
did n't get more water , checked on once .
this is however the last time that we will be ordering from them .
your wife is just confused .
we will stick to thai basil down the street .
i ordered pho beef meatball and the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
we probably wo n't be coming back here again .
the service is just absolutely mediocre .
he 'd prefer to give me two boba teas instead .
i can tell my business is not appreciated here ... .
i 'm down .
i waited _num_ mins and they made it wrong !
bad service .
warning : stay away from this place .
we ate there a few times with no problems .
he barely said sorry .
needless to say i wo n't be going back !
they have the worst pho i 've ever had !
their seafood pho sucks monkey balls a million times .
service was bad .
just do n't ever get pho here !
it really is strictly business for me here .
over all , this particular branch is ok .
instead , i went to a branch down the street .
avoid this branch !
really bad experience and customer service .
so when i get there , they had no idea that i was coming .
they had nothing ready for me .
by that time it 's been like _num_ min already .
another _num_ min go by just for a damn stamp .
overall really bad customer service and experience .
she answer in a very rude way .
_num_ weeks ago they forgot part of delivery order .
no more .
you 've lost this customer .
but , they never bring our sauces .
we typically order _num_ to _num_ extra sauces that we pay for .
terrible service .
their hours listed says they 're supposed to be open till 1am .
maybe they only want to remain delivery for the night for more tips ?
ordered _num_ pizza 's for a company event .
i received horribly cut cold pizza .
my cinnamon sticks were cold .
all of my food was cold .
i asked for root beer but they brought me dr pepper .
very unhappy .
i was forced to look elsewhere .
i called this salon basically for the lower prices .
not fabulous , but i knew that going in there .
but once i went to pay , they did n't want to honor it .
they even wanted to charge me for having to mix extra hair dye .
there was no reason she needed extra .
disappointed with the service .
not totally impressed with the cutting either .
had to drive other salon nearby to have my haircut fixed .
if u plan on renting do not rent here !
absolutely horrible !
the complex is awful .
i 'm not saying everyone is like this , just most of them .
they are loud , obnoxious , and have little to no respect for anything .
the residents are the worst .
i can not wait until my lease is up .
truth be told , i would not have rented this place .
my friend did but only made one visit before deciding .
big mistake !
they call it a luxury apartment , it is not !
the teenagers were _num_ and up .
as for me and my children , we will be breaking our lease .
just horrible communication .
old apartments that are in poor repair .
i wish i had gone somewhere that charges less but will lie to me .
i can ignore lies but i ca n't get back the money .
will not go here again nor will i recommend them .
i still would not use them ever again .
stinks off smoke , bad waitress service , average to poor food .
cheap quality food .
toast is hard as croutons and served dry .
no going to be back here again .
this place was terrible .
however there were _num_ chicken fingers and that was it .
felt totally ripped off .
$ _num_ for the high end wash is reasonably priced .
the button does n't work .
worst car wash ever !
my car probably would have been cleaner from a rain storm !
this is _num_ !
your boss does n't have a phone ?
well , not worth my time and not in the mood to fight .
some of us do n't have time to go inside .
it 's not that difficult to put paper in the machine .
so pathetic .
it 's not difficult to put paper in the machine .
his reply , '' i only have one mechanic here , no . ''
i 'm not kidding you .
it 's the first oil change for my recently bought _num_ hyundai accent .
oil change actually costs $ _num_ and it 's a small inexpensive car .
nothing needs replacement .
they were trying to rip me off .
never going back !
total rip off !
my car is no hot rod .
when i say unprofessional , i mean just that .
they are shady and will ripe you off .
they advertise $ _num_ oil change .
would not come back .
watch out for their false advertisement .
my second time their diet coke was not working .
most recently they were out of large cups .
called to set up appointment for pool price quote .
larry the owner answered said he would have his son ryan call us back .
no follow up skills what so ever .
needless to say we 're looking elsewhere .
please do not eat at this location .
oh and the cashier ca n't count .
she short changed me .
it gets worse every time i go .
this place is not very consistent .
i 'll skip this one as much as i can from now on .
the first two times was because they did n't make the order correct .
i dont even think it deserved a star in the first place .
right next to this awful mcdonalds .
she didnt even care when i asked her to take my order .
she just ignored me the whole time .
worst attitudes .
gets orders wrong .
simple orders too .
they got our order wrong .
it is a saturday night and there should be more help .
i have n't even ordered .
this is just ridiculous .
worst mcdonald in las vegas .
ca n't get my order right when i repeated myself _num_ times .
then when i get my food that i asked for with no onions .
no customer service .
no apologies .
just unacceptable .
i would advise anyone to eat taco bell instead .
im not coming back to this chapel again .
very , very noisy .
food was mediocre .
what a f # @ king dump ... and the managers are a joke .
in the end , after about _num_ minutes , i received a flat beer .
no , different one each time .
everytime i go there i have an issue with the service .
i just like a server who remembers im there .
even with the _num_ for $ _num_ .
never been disappointed with it .
i 'm going to give his teacher _num_ $ and stay home for dinner .
terrible service and dry flavorless food .
food came out and it was super dry and flavorless .
not coming here again .
horrible ( that 's an understatement ) service .
sat and waited for _num_ minutes for someone to even come to the table !
never going back .
when we walked in , there was no host .
the place was n't that busy .
there was a long wait for a greet .
i ordered water before the meal and the bartender never brought it .
nothing was cleared off until she picked up our credit card for payment .
horrible service and ignored several times by the server .
food was prepared wrong .
would not recommend this particular applebees to anyone .
finished our pasta and still no bread .
also our appetizers were chips and salsa along with some spinach dip .
my cousins wife 's drink was done sort of sangria with cranberry in it .
she took one sip and realized how disgusting it was .
this was a slow sunday night by the way .
it was barely even busy .
i would not recommend this place .
just horrible service .
she was rude & looked like she hated her life .
like why would you bother to bring me it to begin with .
like what the hell .
we will not go back due to their lack of customer service .
so they have lost our business .
but we will not be coming here anymore .
please it is only applebee 's .
not impressed .
_num_ ) they must have a new cook .
food is not like it used to be .
fries are cheap !
salad was over dressed and too much croutons .
why would you serve me trash ?
however we are ultimately disappointed each time .
until then , i will not be returning .
this was bad experience from the start .
there were at least _num_ open booths in plain view from the waiting area .
it was n't terribly busy .
once sat , we met our waitress .
which was one of the three times we talked to her all night .
it was n't exceptional , but it was n't terrible .
tiffany was our server .
not good appearance , my medium sirloin actually was a well done sirloin .
very bad customer service .
the only good thing that happen ... .
service sucks , appetizers come out _num_ minutes after ordering with _num_ meal !
had to beg to have dirty glasses removed from the table .
worst place to go !
expected longer time because large order ( _num_ entrees , _num_ appetizers ) .
got there in about _num_ minutes .
sat _num_ min , some one stuck head out said be right there .
about _num_ minutes later he came out apologized again for the delay .
got home and everything was nasty .
this was one of worst meals we 've ever paid for .
for sure in top three what a waste of money .
we ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer , they were barely cooked .
cheese not even slightly melted on the inside .
when our drinks came , the diet pepsi was completely flat and gross .
i guess the next gut was getting a flat soda too .
every time i go to any location it ends badly .
the worst part was the service .
this company apparently allows total jerks to drive for them .
this tour sucked .
everything that they advertise is a lie .
then they wo n't let you leave .
the damn tour is a joke .
they rushed us because they wasted time on drivers .
you are better off renting a car for the day and just driving there .
forget the tour , they show you down to hallways and that is all .
it was a total waste of time .
bus runs every _num_ minutes at the stops .
be careful and ask questions prior to booking the hoover dam tour .
or should i have walked home ?
i would give zero stars if i could .
they do n't answer any calls , never call you back .
they do n't even give you a proper estimate to install a tank .
just awful .
wish i could leave no stars .
do n't even bother it 's not even worth the gas .
i 'll just toss them where i finish my drinks !
it 's not about getting cash back .
this is appalling .
this place was gross .
he paid for my meal but i was sick with worry .
the service was poor and the food looked old and dry .
the bread was stale .
there is no key .
the smell just makes me lose my appetite .
the server was very polite and took my order promptly .
by the time i ate it was all soggy .
this facility runs like a factory .
the receptionist and the staff i did encounter are very impersonal .
i felt very uncomfortable and was treated like a number .
i will not waste another dime here .
all they want is your money !
less than a month later , my insurance had paid for the claim .
( ? )
the front desk is unorganized and staffed with incompetent people .
our case manager was extremely unprofessional with zero bedside manners .
needless to say , we did n't go back after such an experience .
pros - staff was very helpful and responsive .
we went to three la very reputable clinics .
disappointed is the understatement of the year .
it 's cheap pizza , what can you say .
nothing to write home about .
the bread sticks were pretty good though .
the pizza is very dry .
we got thin crust and is was crusty and dry .
bad business papa .
the pizza was n't that good either .
how badly someone can screw up an order like this is beyond me .
one of the worst airports to have to fly in or out of .
the floors are really hard to sleep on too !
no , i do n't want your fucking credit card !
i hate this airport .
mccarran set a whole new low for me .
poor excuse for an airport .
due to delays i had to run to the gate .
directions to the gate were nonexistent .
getting a cab from las is insane .
bad , terrible , worst ever .
so gross .
i would consider never going to vegas in order to avoid this airport .
_num_ stars after all this talk of free wireless .
at least it was a dry heat .
_num_ stars , _num_ stars for this airport ?
yes , it is very vegas because you can gamble .
the security personnel were rude and cranky .
_num_ star because i won $ _num_ from a slot machine .
with that said , i am just not a fan .
the baggage claim systems really sucks .
no bags .
again , no bags .
asked again , same result .
ick .
otherwise , avoid like the plague .
no complaints here .
security checkin : this is where it went down hill fast .
one of the worst i have ever seen at any major city .
it was just plain filthy .
its very poorly organized and poorly maintained .
it 's just plain ugly .
um , this place sucks .
cheap microwaved food for everyone ! )
you hardly need to walk _num_ feet to start gambling .
once arriving , getting baggage , then had to get a taxi .
the security line at mccarran is brutal .
at peak times , i 've never seen anything longer .
not a big deal , but just give yourself time .
getting taxi 's here is horrible too .
and i 'm disappointed .
this airport sucks .
ugh .
i am not a fan of this airport .
either than that , it 's just a mess .
old , smelly , confusing layout , etc .
kinda confusing if you never been to this airport before .
it 's the only good thing going for them right now !
just thinking about flying into this airport makes my skin crawl .
worst baggage claim in the world .
horrible drop off and pick up layout .
this requires little thought .
one of the most depressing airports i have ever been to in my life .
do n't think i can spend more than an hour here .
awful .
maybe some taxi drivers need to move to vegas .
the people were rude when i went .
i 'm not impressed with the atmosphere .
i 'm not into gambling and there 's slots everywhere .
it is a big airport and it 's not easy to navigate .
going through security is a horrid mess .
i mean come on , where is the customer service ?
flying is uncomfortable enough as it is without airport staff being jerks .
free wifi , but half of the restaurants were closed or closed off !
wolfgang was randomly closed .
maybe , maybe other areas of this airport are nice ... ?
this terminal has not been updated in what looks like decades .
and speaking of mccarran 's restaurants and bars , they mostly suck too .
las vegas has a few negatives though .
but the biggest negative -- the slot machines .
it has alot of shops and alot of employees .
it 's a mistake !
las has free wifi , which every airport should have .
other than that , it pretty much sucks .
driving to / from the airport is very confusing .
the baggage claim can be very slow .
i arrived here from palm desert with _num_ minutes to make a plane change .
you 're forced to take something like a tram .
it was dark and i saw no security whatsoever anywhere .
it smelled bad in there .
i did n't mind the walk , but i was getting short on time .
you ca n't leave me in this horrid place !
that 's not right .
in short , this place is terrible .
i was so pissed .
got picked up and dropped off and checked in by 2pm .
that 's a different terminal but ok , here we go .
no real updates until the very end .
so frustrating .
tsa personal are rude .
life sucks then you get on your airplane .
okay whatever , it 's not but i 'll take it off .
me : ( annoyed ) kinda have to with these things !
but it 's never set off the machine before , ever ?
this is one of the worst airports in the us .
there is no sky club or partner equivalent .
ugh .
this has got to be one of the worst airports ever .
the check-in lines are usually long , esp on sunday .
the baggage claim is also horrendous .
having to arrive early for flights sucks just a little bit more at mccarran .
stupid people .
annoying .
get car , and then get stuck in vegas traffic .
this might be my least favorite airport in america .
_num_ hour wait for a cab line , are you kidding me ?
i dont like to mix my planes and trains .
impressions of a large airport in bat country .
- dark , dingy like a bus station .
how is `` see 's '' candies staying in business ?
uncomfortable , but a train wreck or nightmare you ca n't forget .
wait , maybe that 's five stars .
very long lines , high traffic which led to delayed flight and smokey .
worst airport experience ever .
everyone was slow and rude .
nothing makes me want to go back home quicker .
hell , a new paint job would do wonders !
i pass through mccarran a few times every year .
wow , getting through security gets worse every time i go .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
this airport can be extremely hectic .
note ... this is a _num_ lbs dog that i was carrying .
well , the airport is dated and dingy .
it is poorly laid out and confusing .
some of the tsa agents are also rude .
i also noticed a major lack of shopping , souvenir places or food places .
i want to kick the shit out of this airport .
is n't it essentially the same distance ?
the shuttle shit is so weird .
bud light is $ _num_ .
a wendy 's value meal is $ _num_ .
dumb .
i 'm seriously glad that i had _num_ hour to get over there !
any airport that features that in one of their terminals is officially pretty douche .
that just kills me every time i see it .
maybe it 's because i never noticed before .
all i know is this airport is a dump .
the bathrooms are gross .
to my knowledge it does not exist .
not too exciting .
terminal _num_ could definitely use a makeover , facelift , or renovation .
the tsa is not so friendly but they get the job done at least .
there are hardly any food places to choose from at this terminal either .
bottom line : boo to you , terminal _num_ .
each time the place was closing down and nothing to eat .
the worst airport i 've ever been to .
this used to be my favorite airport in the country .
it 's not like i do n't know my way around airports by now .
sucks .
_num_ margaritas and one nachos = $ _num_ .
the lady looked pretty surprised and confused .
my turn to order , i asked for two slices of pizza .
i have a long flight back home and i 'm starting to get hungry .
i figured a milkshake would hold me over for a few hours .
besides , you ca n't screw up a milkshake , right ?
i left out several other experiences , but this review is long enough .
this airport sucks .
very poorly .
there is no other place on earth like the las vegas airport .
leaving the las vegas airport is another story .
at lease the slot machine wo n't give me diarrhea .
hell no , i 'm going to fly to midway international airport instead . ''
also , i hate the slot machines .
i didnt see one but i did see paris hilton 's limo driver .
the limo driver turned me down .
i think i 've been spoiled with san diego & san jose .
the bathrooms here are nasty !
not enough seating .
this has to be one of my least favorite airports .
first off , the terminal is super far from the entrance of the airport .
it is like they have never flown before .
no clue how to get through security .
the food choices in terminal d suck .
just awful .
and $ _num_ for a bottled soda , you are kidding me .
$ _num_ for a bottle of water , is that even possible ?
the building quite nice , but everything is ridiculously over priced .
six dollars for a price of pizza , four for a bag of candy .
there were well over _num_ people in the regular line .
_num_ of us came up and had electronic boarding passes .
i do n't have this problem at other airports .
not a fan .
anyway , that pretty much is a vegas style hook up .
no really , i swear .
absolutely the worst security people ever !
the line for security was ridiculous and the people working it were even worse .
incredibly slow and power hungry employees make for a horrible experience .
i 'm just glad i did n't miss my flight .
the choices for food here were very very limited .
for the number of people coming through it is small and thus very crowded .
the wifi is in and out , strong signal , weak signal .
the food courts are disgusting .
granted , i do not fear las vegas .
that 's all that stands out to me .
never thought i 'd be looking forward to airplane food .
pathetic .
worst airport ever .
freakin ridiculous .
for me , i 'm over it .
no more vegas , please .
it 's ugly and uncomfortable .
the food choices in the southwest terminal are awful .
i hate tram rides in airports .
most of the time i 'd just rather walk .
airport is n't bad , tsa is rude and liars .
it 's vegas and i would expect a more classy airport .
just a weird place to be in .
this airport is seriously lacking food options .
prepare to wait out in the hot desert heat a while .
there were n't even enough spaces for people to sit !
bad .
tsa at las vegas is really bad .
this last experience coming back home left a bad taste in my mouth .
but they were overpriced and not all that nice .
worst airport i have ever been to !
tsa 's are the worst .
airline agents located at the airport suck .
hmm , no that would be lying , we could never be that ignorant .
worst airport i 've ever been to .
there 's no signage .
thats lame !
they have a nascar themed bar that is a special slice of hell .
be prepared , you have been warned !
the food is too freaking expensive !
$ _num_ for a stupid bottle of water !
slot machines in the waiting areas ... need i say more .
ugh that stripper stole all my money .
ugh what was i thinking when i married that girl last night ?
yup ... totally left ugly on purpose !
it 's an airport , they all suck ... .
ok why does the gate have to be like a million miles away ?
when you get there , it seems ok .
on the way home , everything is miserable .
the long walk to security .
this is definately the most depressing airport i 've been to .
the only thing this place has is free wifi .
the food prices are horrible !
baggage is slow .
no other airport i 've been to allows this to happen .
one of my least favourite airports any where .
for such a busy airport it lakes almost no dining choices beyond fast food .
there is nearly no shopping options .
tsa at this location is horrendous .
i can not begin to tell you how much i despise these people .
food service could use major improvement !
ugh .
not an airport i care to go through again .
they seriously need some remodeling done .
it may take _num_ or _num_ minutes to clear ... .
there is no issue arriving there but people and workers are annoying .
there are not that many options for food at the airport .
this airport is dirty , ridiculous , and not user friendly .
as if traveling is n't already stressful .
reading over this i see the problem ... haha .
so glad tsa let us through the gates and we made it on home .
the airport itself is pretty standard .
the food choices past security are pretty lame .
vegas needs to get control of that .
that in itself makes this airport annoying enough .
ick .
you get nothing at the vegas airport .
it is time for a major overhaul of this airport .
one of my least favorite airports in the country .
this airport is just like any other airport if not worse .
$ _num_ subs .
very sparse food selection .
anyways , the airport is older , not modern at all .
i guess this does give this airport some personality and some `` charm '' .
the toilets do not flush well .
some signs posted to tell you where you 're headed are a bit confusing .
this one makes me feel like i landed in reno , nevada .
i avoid it whenever possible .
it 's no wonder why people drive to vegas from phoenix .
checking in is terrible so go early .
security takes forever so again get there early .
their tsa staff , i must admit , is friendly though .
probably the worst airport i have ever been too ... do not enjoy !
outside of the volume issue it was a typical airport .
tsa lady i got was a total b !
flew in an out of international terminal or terminal _num_ .
and the reps , every single one had serious attitude .
nascar weekend , _num_ shuttle running from tsa to gates , no very smart .
almost missed my flight .
your killing me .
the people that work here are rude !
worst airport ever .
this place is n't terrible , but it 's a bit of a mess .
there are check in computers that serve all airlines , which makes it easy .
they were n't short staffed , so why make it so hard ?
either way , las vegas needs to make some changes here .
it 's just kind of a dank room you 're in .
_num_ stars , rounded up because one star reviews make me so sad .
avoid it if you can .
oh lv airport , you scare me .
no , your security line up people scare me .
the yelling .
why must you yell ?
see , that 's not nice .
disgusting .
it smells , looks and acts like a shitty casino .
this is a crappy airport especially considering its freaking vegas .
airports suck and this one is no exception .
food choices are limited behind security .
maybe it was just a bad day or something .
the food options range from awful to disgusting .
the security lines are long ( but do seem to be improving ) .
also frustrating was the hike to get to the d gates .
overall not a terrible airport , but am certainly `` meh .
not enough security to run people through efficiently .
seriously only two people to check in luggage .
mccarran does n't seem that bad anymore .
talk about low standards .
leaving is bit more difficult .
ugh .
but security lines can be a nightmare .
and the restaurant options are downright depressing .
the bars [ imagine this ] are always full and there 's never seating .
the food choices suck , the restrooms -- i 'd rather hold it .
and the blue carpet that smells like your high school gym ... ugh .
also , im an idiot .
and they chose the worst of it too .
at least the security was nearly empty and quick as a beat .
we had _num_ minutes to go across the airport and almost misses our flight .
me neither until i visited this airport .
it 's always busy and it 's difficult to find where you 're going .
- no free wifi .
huge , nasty stains on the carpeting .
but you should really lower your bottled water price from $ _num_ .
this is my least favorite airport to fly into .
it is usually crowded ( vegas , duh ! )
however , the real fun started when we tried to fly home .
viva las vegas , baby !
it 's really a nightmare and can take up to an hour .
purchased a luggage cart to push a child seat , and a roller bag .
however luggage carts are not allowed past security !
so stupid .
anyways to why i despise picking someone up from this airport .
where the hell do i go then ?
it was never ending walk to our gate .
this tiny , efficient airport does not have much more to offer than that .
no restaurants , a few cheap shops .
but having to be there in the mid afternoon was a hot mess .
mess .
nice shops for souvenirs , candy , snacks , drinks .
ugh .
the last thing i want to do is smell someone else 's hangover .
i might as well been at a street fest it was so crowded everywhere .
less than helpful directions in baggage claim .
the ick : the bathrooms were horrendous .
terminal c needs new carpet and more electric outlets .
not my favorite airport .
this means i 'm either dropping off the party people of picking them up .
the airport itself is a bit small and lines for everything move pretty slow .
shame on them that is the last place you should see that happen .
bus , train anyone ?
no good food options to boot .
ugh .
simply , i hate this airport .
probably the worst airport i 've ever been to .
oh and the wi-fi is not the best either .
the main terminal , terminal _num_ is easy to get around and navigate .
the new terminal , terminal _num_ is ridiculous .
wrong .
wrong again .
is this confusing yet ?
if you are flying out of terminal _num_ , give yourself extra time .
i found the signs confusing and could n't figure out where to go .
vegas hates me .
with that being said , i stay far far far away from vegas .
i have no idea but it always seems like the case for me .
i could n't believe i lost so hard in a matter of minutes .
that 's my bitter visual .
what a crappy airport .
mccarran needs better signs for where airlines are !
terminal _num_ is for international flights i think .
the carpet looks old as do the chairs and not in a cool way .
badly in need of renovation .
worst tsa security i 've ever experienced .
rude and lazy staff , took forever and it was due to being inefficient .
i wish i could give zero stars because this airport blows .
took me over _num_ minutes to get through ... .
stuck here on a layover ?
try and find an available power outlet to charge your phone or computer ?
at least the taxi line goes quickly .
the starbucks is slow as hell .
wow , but mccarran is a weird airport .
: not good ) with the airport .
gross .
the food sucks too , which is also a big downside .
the line always moves terribly slow .
i hate this airport , check in counters are so outdated and slow .
if i can avoid this place i would .
this has to be the worst airport i ever been too .
it looks like everyone here hates their job .
anytime i ask anybody for service or question i get a sarcastic rude answer .
i do n't know what to make of it .
should i get offended and ask what their problem is or brush it off .
just do n't expect any type of good customer service .
this is easily my least favorite airport i have ever been to .
it was so crowded and loud !
next time i 'll avoid this airport like the plague !
idiots .
let 's say you only have one x-ray machine open .
not these guys .
not these guys .
let 's open up _num_ different lines for one x-ray machine !
he was very old , and very kind , but very stupid .
chairs have no plug .
last visit was in _num_ , and things do n't seem to have improved .
well , crap .
this airport sucks .
our flight home was in the late hours of the night .
he tried finding a worker from the airport but no one was available .
luckily for me i hated las vegas .
i probably wo n't come back unless it 's something important .
it does not have to be this way .
only took a few minutes to get a taxi to our hotel .
-- really tsa ?
do you have to shout and scream at everyone ?
and do n't assume that everyone going through line travels often .
do n't scream at me .
kiss my butt .
-- food choices appeared pathetic for an airport .
i do n't travel often , but i 've had better airport experiences .
the taxi line is why i always rent a car .
the airport seemed small and very noisy and i was delayed .
in all my air travels , this airport ranks as _num_ of the worse .
how annoying is that ?
what a crap airport .
hire more employees .
rude staff .
security was a breeze , checking in was n't awful .
makes me wonder if they had a lack of space to work with .
at one point it just stopped .
needless to say , we missed our flight .
then , it 's kind of a mess , too !
i wish there was another airport besides this one .
ugh , so uncomfortable .
outside the airport , they have shuttle buses to go from terminal to terminal .
what 's the reason for _num_ star for this airport ?
too much slot machines .
i do n't like their noisy sound .
i tried to find a place to get a beer and pass the time .
mccarran needs a makeover .
so do n't read it if you do n't want to .
_num_ star for the shitty ass staffs .
not even from la to new york , or boston .
it 's flying local , dumb shit .
you do n't fucking need a passport .
this airport needs a little updating for modern travelers .
this airport is hell .
men 's bathroom had multiple broken toilets with trash overflowing .
either broken or _num_ people to an outlet .
never buy anything there .
they also charge you a _num_ % up charge for cc purchases .
avoid it fellow travelers !
old , dirty and disorganized !
the security lines and baggage claim areas are horribly overcrowded .
service is slow .
it can get pretty confusing finding your gate or getting out of your gate .
it was just so inconvenient .
would definitely not recommend this .
there are not enough seats .
half of the travelers are sitting on the floor .
too busy .
hands down the most disgusting airport ever !
the airport is small , smoky and confusing .
terrible on sunday evening when hungover people are not good at following tsa instructions .
i 'm not making excuses for them ; they know where they work .
really ?
it 's really bad .
not cool .
overall thought , it def does the job of welcoming you to sin city .
dirty and noisy .
sky harbor in phoenix is much , much nicer .
otherwise i would have lost my mind by now .
toilet paper ( used ?
not so sure ... ) everywhere !
this place was busy , but that 's no excuse not to be clean .
and what kind of an airport does n't have a mcdonald 's ?
wo n't be flying through here again unless i do n't have another option .
my favorite part of this airport is flying in and flying out at night .
but god help you if you get stuck there like i did .
i do n't understand the layout of this place .
i 've seen bus stations that are cleaner .
i 'm constantly being bumped into and pushed coming and going .
there is a a general lack of seating at the food courts as well .
really makes me uncomfortable about the security level at this airport .
it does n't .
the boarding areas are way too small .
no charging stations anywhere .
food options stinks .
worst airport i have ever stepped foot in .
the directions to the various gates are god awful .
next thing you know , you 're lost .
bathrooms are sick !
saturday after thanksgiving they were `` understaffed '' who the hell thought of that !
this airport ( the southwest terminal at least ) is so old and outdated .
it smells like an old basement .
food choices are seriously lacking though there is a new pei wei .
the b gates have seriously not been updated since the _num_ 's .
the restrooms are old , too .
i never did , so i have no feelings towards that .
i 'm neither bothered by it .
but good chocolate is never cheap anyway .
i believe it is $ _num_ per person .
this airport ( the southwest terminal at least ) is so old and outdated .
it smells like an old basement .
food choices are seriously lacking though there is a new pei wei .
the b gates have seriously not been updated since the _num_ 's .
really confusing airport .
lax seems more organized than this place .
that 's not good .
the shuttles are very small buses that can not accommodate luggage .
so no room in the shuttles .
it is too far to walk .
i can only assume that all the big buses were taken .
nothing looks local at all .
they only take your money and leave you with a sour taste for vegas .
i had to hang out for _num_ hours due to flight delay .
they only put money in , never seemed to take it out .
worst airport i 've ever been to hands down .
food is bad , and expensive even for an airport .
tsa tends to be quick , the only upside .
awful place to be stuck when the flight is late .
meal choices are also terrible .
_num_ step above lax - blech .
okay soooo the vegas airport is n't all that nice .
very poorly maintained terminal for a big city like vegas .
terrible .
numerous people in front of me were late and/or running to their airplane .
i walked all over the terminal .
everything except a little news stand was closed .
nothing to see , nothing to do .
some of the worst airport food i 've seen .
even the starbucks did n't have fruit .
this airport sucks .
it is outdated and not well managed .
people are rude and no one could be bothered .
the restaurants are overcrowded and not a lot to choose from .
there are no outlets and no room to sit or walk .
if you live in the west , you are better off driving .
the signs totally sucked !
there is no place to plug in .
poor directions and even worse common meeting areas .
this airport is so-so .
it is ridiculous .
people sitting on the floor along walls is super lame .
and it 's about _num_ degrees in here .
i hate this airport i always get lost .
the driver can never find me i just hate it .
literally it took the driver like an hour to find me .
tsa employees are some of the rudest that i have encountered .
food and drink choices are lacking , mostly overpriced fast food .
very long walk from security to the gates in terminal one .
there is just something about me that does not like this airport .
but , this place just is n't clean .
this place is _num_ years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want .
really not a good airport .
would it really be that difficult for the airport to install additional seating ?
the security lines are horrible on a regular basis .
takes forever to get your bags , at least from american airlines .
also when i just checked , there were no uber cars available .
i 'm not up on the latest las vegas news .
but , they are n't very many .
gross , loud , and crowded .
and , quite frankly , it 's a struggle to even look at .
ya , there are loud slot machines .
ya , there 's an einstein bagel .
so we walked over _num_ gates down to where we were suppose to go .
then they got to take off and we were delayed too .
terrible .
the signage is misleading as well .
surprisingly not many good options for eating , at least in some terminals .
i really do n't like this airport .
i avoid it when i can and dip through it when it 's necessary .
i spent $ _num_ on a hamburger once that was not that great .
you really ca n't wait to get out of the airport to gamble ?
go buy some $ _num_ chocolates and call it a day .
_num_ ) this airport has a lot of slot machines .
for example , there is a coffee bean about _num_ feet from a starbucks .
_num_ ) if you like people watching , this is your airport .
they are loud .
imagine paying $ _num_ for a vegetarian burger king burger .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i spent $ _num_ on _num_ small pork tacos .
_num_ ) this airport is very crowded .
this is not one of my favorite airports .
baggage pickup is somewhat difficult .
lots of things here seem like poor planning to me .
why does it have to be so cold here ?
port of sin city .
we were picking up and security made us move .
perhaps and accessible cell phone lot would be helpful .
quick edit , there is wifi , it was hard to find .
they are loud .
the biggest problem i have with this airport is their tsa .
i can not say the same for the vegas tsa .
getting better employees would make this airport better .
left a bitter taste in my mouth .
not very many nice restaurants at the terminal i was at .
the car rental return is farther from the airport than the strip .
mccarran airport is the worst .
it 's 4:30 am with only _num_ lanes open at the security check point .
unacceptable !
worst airport ever .
not a fan .
not very organized .
i 'm glad i arrived _num_ hours early because you know what might happen .
nothing good to say about this airport .
terrible selection of seemingly always understaffed restaurants and bars ( i.e .
i have to say , to start , that i am biased .
anything more than _num_ gates and i 'm irritated and overwhelmed .
so mccarran is absolutely not my cup of tea .
it takes a long time to get your bags .
one personal experience led this review to be bad rather than just mediocre .
go ahead and hate me if you want .
have n't you guys made enough cash ?
what about just having them outside the freaking gates , like the hallways ?
over all though , you suck mccarran international airport !
there are always people sitting on the floor because there is not enough seating .
everybody is hunting for an electrical outlet .
tsa where delta is at is horrible .
no , not the lines , but the people working there .
hats off ! ''
yet , this older tsa fellow was rude to her .
airport is really stuffy .
also , no uber services here .
so prepare to cough up to take a cab to the las vegas strip .
and careful of shady drivers who drive you around the airport .
consistently the worse baggage handling .
it reminds me of a mall inside of an airport .
it is confusing and the signs do n't show you where everything is .
for such a busy airport , this is the worst terminal ever .
the air conditioning sucks and my seat on the plane has better ventilation .
terminal _num_ at the c gates needs a remodel .
if they would dump united , i would give them _num_ stars .
did you know that las vegas has a monorail ?
but it does n't go to the airport .
confusing .
security : are you traveling alone ?
we tried to charge our phones , hardly any outlets were working .
some people went behind ticket counters to charge their phones .
there is way too much extra space here .
seriously , folks ... can you not wait until you get to your hotel ?
parts are recently renovated it seems , which were nice .
it does n't make me feel better about it , though .
anyway , rant over .
all restaurants and bars were closed ... .
tasted like crap .
bad stop .
san jose is close to my favorite .
_num_ ) parking ... passenger pick up is always a nightmare .
compared to california la airport parking prices in vegas are cheap !
so this is a plus but now to the bad .
_num_ ) terminals .
hate hate hate the old .
old terminal very dark .
the new terminal is much brighter and feels more open .
no carpet there .
charging stations by the bathroom away for the gate is annoying .
_num_ ) food selection .
it 's terrible !
so sick of fast food greasy selections .
a good banana too !
overall this airport needs to remodel and update .
the only reason i even gave two stars is for the new terminal .
wtf is this crap ?
why is my luggage taking so long to come out ?
why ca n't i just flag one down like people do in normal cities ?
why did the tram break down ?
why are your tsa agents such mega assholes ?
no , i do n't want to hear about jesus .
why did the airport shuttle let me off at the wrong gate ?
tsa is rude and inefficient .
i 've never so many people waiting for taxis with no taxis in sight .
so we went back inside , through security .
this is not an airport .
worst airport in the world .
it 's ridiculous and there 's never enough flights to wait on .
i 've been here for over _num_ hours .
avoid southwest and this airport like the plague .
i 'm driving to vegas next time .
wo n't be traveling through vegas airport again .
no need to be nasty .
jamba juice in the terminal _num_ , c section is a bonus .
also , why is airport food so expensive ?
it 's not gourmet food .
confused the crap out of me .
the layout of terminal _num_ is a mess .
there is poor signage everywhere .
still annoying , though .
the shops and restaurants were anything special to me and i do n't gamble .
the check in area is a little chaotic , cramped feeling and confusing .
slot machines are still there but without players .
not the cleanest airport i 've been in .
my main problem with this airport ?
ugh - not a fan of mccarran .
horrible experience with the southwest terminals .
so disappointed .
what a mess .
security and tsa has to be the worst set up i have ever seen .
this airport feels divey and dirty and needs a face lift .
i hate this place .
if i did n't have to fly into las vegas here i would n't .
just ick ick ick .
always a horrible experience for me in this airport .
dingy , dirty , people are rude .
flat out depressing .
waited _num_ minutes for shuttle and it never came .
this review is about the arrival pick up at terminal _num_ .
i always hate being picked up here .
hate it .
i totally understand that they are just avoiding people parking .
i would have rather walked to terminal _num_ and avoid being yelled at .
if you know how to make it over there , do that instead .
it smells like cigarettes and cigars .
but hey it 's vegas -- what else could one expect ?
i do n't love the lack of good / healthy food options .
they never seem to have enough cabs .
checking in and picking up luggage is always a little chaotic .
they do have limo options too if there are n't cabs left .
casino electronic games add to the cramped and unpleasant nature of this airport .
why is the selection of food so horrible ?
why is it so cramped and ugly ?
one of my least favorite airports .
the airport is old , dirty , crowded and dark .
only in vegas where you could find slots machines at the airport .
if you have trouble finding one then there is something wrong with you .
maybe create more room and get rid of some slots machines ?
it was a hot mess .
the layout was terrible !
did not take much planning at all i can tell .
one of the worst airports to get to ever !
my phone gps was had a hard time finding the front of this airport .
the only positive was that check in and security was super quick .
horrible experience with the taxi system here .
delta -- the woman checking us in was incredibly lazy .
i have never been more dissatisfied with my service in vegas .
i am disgusted with this airport .
this is a serious fuck up , excuse my language but i am livid .
if this rating were based just on their efforts they would receive 4-5 stars .
this lower rating is due to the out of date airport .
this airport is as bad as oakland 's before their makeover .
mccarran airport shuttle is terrible !
they always take forever or loose my bags here .
also this `` make it difficult to uber passengers '' is getting old .
if taxi drivers can pick passengers up right outside so should uber .
so they get another star for that .
such a terrible experience .
it was a really bad experience .
not a single allergy friendly place to eat in the airport .
i have a family member with a horrible soy allergy .
one person says _num_ thing , another person says another .
it took less than _num_ minutes to get across .
called the airport and was told to send an email to a specific department .
wrote and email and it went totally ignored .
i ended up filing a police a report .
this is terrible service .
there are very few options and the slim options you have are not good .
she talked at us and not to us .
very poorly managed .
had to wait in line for over _num_ mins to get to security check .
airport 's outdated .
not enough outlets or charging stations .
not enough seats at each gate .
restroom facilities are not clean .
tsa slow during rush hour , only had two lanes open .
worst security check point ever !
but they still chose to open only _num_ lanes !
i stood in line for almost half an hour trying to get in .
however , my second half of the journey would be a little unsure .
and i was not even the only one .
and he missed the flight for exactly the same reason .
i am not suggesting they should do anything less at the security check .
the security is slow , the tsa folks are n't friendly .
i hate flying into vegas .
the terminal layout does not help either .
i missed my connection going and coming back .
most inconvenient airport with the slowest possible airport security !
this was unprofessional and somewhat racist of him .
upon arriving at terminal one , there was no baggage for terminal three .
i could not take the team back .
but passengers miss it all the time .
clearly there is no correct baggage signage .
full of passengers returning to terminal three .
i am waiting with over a dozen passengers also returning to terminal thee .
most are tourists very frustrated with their inconvenient `` welcome '' to las vegas .
my week long trip an hour ago if you had correct signage .
three lines for well over two thousand people is n't enough .
the only reason they got one star is i could n't give them zero .
how can an airport be so depressing ?
the carpets are filthy and the restrooms are worse .
it 's a long airport and hard to find places .
the restaurants there have the same dank depressing feel .
i was so glad to get on my flight and get home .
i like coming here because i know i 'm leaving vegas .
i hate coming here because i know i 'm returning to vegas .
mccarran used to be smaller and you could get to your gate more quickly .
mccarran terminals used to be less a shopping area than a transfer area .
many of these issues are not .
crappy tsa !
and the security is pure garbage !
are they yelling about needing showers ?
peace out , vegas airport .
but nathan 's fast food is the worst .
has a nasty flavor and the service horrible they take the longest time .
they have a smoking lounge but nothing for us moms !
terrible .
as mentioned in other reviews , the vegas airport is my idea of hell .
oh and not to mention it stinks of smoke .
overall it 's just disgusting .
note to self : avoid if at all possible .
the people at inspection were rude yelling at people .
the rude piece of shit workers at starbucks were discussing !
so yeah , this airport is always packed .
the airport is also very spread out .
security and tsa has always been a nightmare for me flying out of mccarran .
worst airport i 've ever been in .
_num_ tsa lanes open .
_num_ hours for security check .
slow agents with horrible attitudes .
never will i fly in or out of lv again .
airport construction ruins your morning .
rental car shuttle takes _num_ to _num_ minutes .
not worth flying from ca .
we would 've been ripped off of an unnecessary payment of $ _num_ .
that would 've been a no bueno !
thankfully it 's only _num_ .
terrible way to end ( or start ) your trip .
i flew out of mccarran several times .
the starbucks is overpriced and the drinks were watered down .
i say stop in the one on flamingo , save yourself the disappointment .
i 'm not a fan of this airport ( at least terminal _num_ ) .
there is no a/c in this airport .
this is going to be a miserable _num_ hour wait .
not a terrible airport to fly in ; awful to fly out of .
i was struggling to walk and almost missed my flight .
honestly , for las vegas this airport is super boring .
the only pro is that they have charging stations for free !
the airport at the gates are in some desperate need of a upgrade .
b grade airport and have seen way better than this one .
depressing place .
old and not so clean .
just kinda gross .
not a fan .
too many to mention !
looks like more than _num_ people inside and out .
for my first time at this airport , it left an awful impression .
for starters , we got there at 7am in our very large rv .
how pathetic is that ?
it printed out a receipt saying to see a cashier .
he chose to ignore my request .
the attendant gave a lot of attitude and asked when our flight was .
everyone i encountered here was extremely rude and unhelpful .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
worst experience ever .
none of the workers know what they are doing when they give direction .
no line process for baggage drop off at american airlines check in .
worst flights of my life .
cramped , dirty , stinky seats .
staff was rude and flight was miserable .
after the last experience , i will never be back .
i 'm totally not kidding !
sooo disappointing ... .
i dont understand why they mail tickets anymore anyways .
never flying southwest again .
no problem putting the arm down ?
maybe staff training is needed in vegas ?
had enough , requested for money back .
i 've never flown with southwest before .
meanwhile my bag is being jammed and crushed into who knows what .
i do n't even want to think about the alternatives .
flying on this airline is so much worse than driving .
all i can say is delayed flights , period .
i 've had the worst experience ever with this airline .
completely ruined my trip .
make sure you eat before you get there , not much there .
never have i been treated like they are doing me a favor .
the check in dude was rude and if i owned this co .
it is so sad .
southwest airlines used to receive a _num_ star rating from me .
they have continued to raise rates .
and , most of the point systems are on the high end .
this is stupid !
it is so sad .
southwest airlines used to receive a _num_ star rating from me .

this is stupid !
... .
my reviews are pretty much the same as everyone else .
prices are sometimes good and bad .
customer service is everything and that is something they lack !
dingy ass workers at starbucks could n't get out order right .
dude reading a magazine at tap out did n't give us any customer service .
on our way home , it was n't any better .
it 's been bad from day one and only continues to get worse .
the mad rush to find seats is both inefficient and annoying .
i just do n't see it .
i love southwest .
it 's a bloody late mess .
i do n't remember being so cramped last time i was on an airplane .
not sure about the `` no electronics '' rules they have .
the attendants did n't seem to care ( or notice ) .
worst experience with an airline in _num_ years !
today 's flight was delayed _num_ hours ; fine , that happens .
turns out the flight left at _num_ !
the only reason to fly sw is a direct flight .
i do n't complain about airlines , because i expect them to suck .
but at sw , they try harder ... to suck .
she did n't greet us warmly but instead called us by saying next .
i used to love southwest but the customer service seems to be lacking .
it 's disappointing to me because they used to be very good .
i am also not a fan of open seating .
coming home from vegas southwest airlines lost half of our luggage on sunday .
southwest is starting to not be as good as it used to be .
i seem to be delayed on _num_ % of the flights i take !
so , i guess you get what you pay for !
what an awful experience .
they did n't even offer me a voucher for losing my luggage , either .
they used to always be on time , lately they are constantly delayed .
with southwest until now .
rude , rude rude lady at check in .
very poor service , very disappointed , sw .
wish i caught his name to write a formal complaint to sw .
flight took off _num_ hours late .
and it 's southwest , so no food , just light snacks .
hate , hate , hate , hate southwest airlines !
this has never happened to me with delta .
not good !
i really want facebook to have a dislike button for southwest airlines .
i used to think southwest is a responsible company for their customers .
however , my impression totally changed today !
happened again on our return flight even though we checked in early .
felt crammed in like cattle .
will probably spend more next time for more comfortable flight .
they never smile and show no sign of enjoyment .
again the most terrible customer service of any airline i have ever flown .
but it just is n't happening .
the flight from las vegas to orange county sucked on st. patty 's day !
same thing on our reno to vegas flight .
they also had no wifi available .
such a shady cheap company and this was an expensive little flight !
checked in _num_ hours prior to departure time and still received last boarding position .
they wanted a $ _num_ fee ... more than the flight cost !
wtf an i supposed to fo about work in the am , room ?
a few days later and our return flight was delayed also ... wtf ?
i have experienced much worse and still got a coke or beer .
also the flight attendants had zero personality .
old broken down dirty planes !
no way !
no where to be found .
southwest is becoming just another airline with poor service .
i would give southwest zero stars if i could .
apparently that was a really bad move on my part .
but wait it gets so much better !
i 'm seriously wondering what the hell the delays are all about !
lastly southwest get your shit together this is embarrassing !
absolute worst airline .
their customer service this morning was absolutely the worst .
i fly only jet blue !
sucks !
all the eating options are generally out of seats as well .
i have checked in exactly 24hrs prior to my flight and got b _num_ .
sorry southwest ... get better customer service and we will gladly switch .
so so so slow .
seeing these people work is like watching paint dry .
why have n't all these people been fired and replaced with a computer .
rude , slow and a joke .
this airline treats customer like cattle .
what little customer service this pathetic airline ever had is long gone .
no value , expensive , poor service and slow .
really stuck it to us on this package deal to vegas .
bad flying experience today .
but he just rudely took it away .
terrible experience on southwest _num_ !
i flew on eight southwest flights in _num_ ... .
seven of those flights were either delayed by several hours or canceled completely .
the last trip from phoenix to vegas was my last straw .
a five minute plane maintenance delay turned into a five hour nightmare .
unless you got horrible money problems , this ai n't the place for you !
canceled my flight and then had the nerve to be rude about it .
claimed maintenance but i suspect it just was n't crammed enough for them .
such a hit and miss experience on sw .
my wife will hate losing the credit card !
at this point i finally reached my breaking point .
i just could n't understand how this whole experience could be so bad .
our first day began and still no bags or updates !
i could n't believe it !
we barely made it to our connection and had nothing to eat !
ugh .
i may have flown southwest for the last time .
no room at all .
really uncomfortable for _num_ hours .
flight got in over an hour late too .
i really do n't like this boarding process .
that was a horrible experience .
_num_ of these _num_ have been delayed at least an hour .
having a hard time giving any review but negative to southwest today .
most of their flights out of mccarran are delayed by several hours .
basically they give zero concern or care .
it 's not in their job description .
but i did pay _num_ to board in the first group .
mccarran airport .
we checked in our bags outside , guy was friendly and helpful .
literally throwing them like he was bowling .
if i had the option to give them zero stars i would .
this type of service is pathetic .
i absolutely hate southwest .
half of the southwest counter people are so rude too .
worst travel experience ever .
whatever , shit happens , i 've had this happen before .
what happened today was inexcusable .
i never had a connection , it was supposed to be the same flight .
( i guess family means _num_ adult and _num_ baby . )
him unnecessary attitude , when he too , just asked a question .
_num_ hour delay .
july _num_ , _num_ .
no compensation offered in return .
not even a discount on a future flight .
hard to say southwest cares about their passengers .
i would not put it past them .
to make matters worse why would they lie ?
we waited about _num_ more minutes before southwest cancelled the flight .
southwest said nothing could be done .
the waiting areas were overcrowded and chaotic .
i am once again let down .
according to the sw airlines app , my flight was delayed .
condescending and rude ticket agents .
employee out of san diego was so rude .
get to las vegas and now the plane is _num_ hours late .
they offered my a $ _num_ southwest voucher .
my husband and i flew southwest airlines for the second time in _num_ years .
until southwest airlines gets assigned seating they just lost our business .
i will pay more money to fly any other airlines that has assigned seating .
southwest airlines is like the walmart store flying in the sky .
just pay a little more and get better service .
flying with a child and having to deal with this is very frustrating .
_num_ hour wait in line .
never again , southwest .
personally , i think it 's crap .
i just do n't see how that 's fair .
my biggest pet peeve was the lack of outlets .
fail southwest .
you get _num_ stars for the pure fact that there was free wi-fi .
my fiance and i were in line _num_ hrs outside and _num_ hrs inside .
guarantee they wo n't even assist or acknowledge this post .
hell no !
currently on flight _num_ in route to florida .
the staff on broad today is a little rude and short with the passengers .
normally i would give southwest air _num_ stars , but not today .
the most frustrating time waiting for flight .
delayed so far _num_ hours and no information given .
guess they figured i did not need to leave las vegas .
worst communication ever .
how annoying !
i was soon introduced to mr sean roberts ( employee number _num_ ) .
so we went to the counter at the gate to get a boarding pass .
unless southwest stands for pissed off customers , that is .
in the end , we are unsure if we 'll ever fly again .
we just do n't feel secure and fully comfortable any longer .
very disappointed !
be careful , this fine print will most likely cost me $ _num_ !
the flight crew is very unorganized during these stops .
which leads me to # _num_ and # _num_ .
_num_ ) no food available .
_num_ ) terrible customer service .
i mean , it was horrible .
the flight attendants that i spoke with were completely rude and unorganized .
_num_ ) no screens in the plane .
this was the cherry on top of this terrible journey .
_num_ ) the price .
if you can , i would recommend virgin airlines .
this airline is the worst .
now i realize why it is so cheap .
why not give me a seat if this is the fault of the airline ?
got bumped and pushed back _num_ hours .
i explained that i was pregnant and not able to lift it that high .
thankfully another passenger helped but she was really rude about it .
it was obvious i would not fit and i explained that to her .
i was so embarrassed and uncomfortable !
i do n't know why she would n't just walk forward .
even the other passengers were shocked and shaking their heads at her .
there are many more airline choices !
if you 're pregnant do n't fly southwest !
not this trip !
but , this was not the issue .
there is absolutely no excuse for rudeness by counter personnel .
the information board behind the counter stated the flight was on time .
unbelievable .
very disappointing # southwest , very disappointing .
no i can not write it down for you !
barbara she 's horrible .
she is such a racist .
please contact me immediately .
i got two tickets round trip for about $ _num_ they charged me twice .
southwest customer service or customer experience is a fail .
the flight attendant named jeremy from reno to vegas is very rude .
she makes southwest look bad .
very rude .
please hire people that want to be there and not giving everyone attitude problems .
and we had already paid $ _num_ to priceline for the rental .
but she was unprofessional and was telling us the wrong things .
she did n't know what she was saying .
do n't trust peoples ' word even after you verify it many times .
i really do n't enjoy pushy sales people .
i 'm a preferred avis customer .
customer rep at the counter was on her period .
she was ignoring us and gave us a face .
`` we do n't add names .
if you want to add a name you need to pay $ _num_ . ''
everyone working here was stuck up their ass for tips .
expect to spend hours standing online to rent a car .
avoid at all costs !
no courtesy from the counter ?
they told me there was nothing they could do about it .
instead of just giving me what was promised , they lost a customer !
i will not be renting from these crooks again !
my worst car rental experience ever .
but that customer rep ruined everything .
it 's the worst rental car place i 've rented from .
i would have given it zero stars but yelp would n't let me .
sketchy and lazy people work here !
spent over _num_ minutes in line .
that said - they have a policy specifically designed to rip customers off .
... fortunately i noticed this and provided the receipt .
i had drove only right outside of the lot and immediately came back in .
i informed them that i would no longer be needing the vehicle .
so i said i would happily wait .
_num_ minutes go by and no manager ever came out .
more negatives than positives to say about this place .
lady took our printed info to look up the reservation .
worst car rental experience ever .
drove it _num_ miles and broke down .
_num_ hour wait in _num_ degree heat for a swap out .
_num_ hour wait in _num_ degree heat .
did n't request a swap out .
here i am _num_ days later still trying to get my money back .
do not rent from this worthless company .
unfortunately , this review was for today 's visit .
instead i 'm giving it a _num_ star rating .
no big deal .
i 've rented from here twice , but never again .
i really hate giving bad reviews , but this was shoddy work at best .
really , is my breath that bad ?
i refused .
he game a kia which runs about _num_ miles per gallon .
the car is really old with _num_ miles on it .
does n't everyone ?
i rented an economy car through costco for use in las vegas .
i booked a car for las vegas to drive back home .
but they only accept major credit cards for dropping off at another location .
what a complete waste of my time on my super short trip .
you too expedia .
really bad customer service .
justin the sale consultant was very very very very very rude .
the line was long so i understand he wants to make sales .
all i want was to know the rates .
managers just standing around .
it is taking over _num_ minutes to get through the line .
last name was the she , credit card was the same and e-mail too .
horrible customer service .
i could have gotten a bigger car for the same price elsewhere .
gave me the suv that was sitting there the whole time i was waiting .
they do no walk around it show you one thing about the car .
have never had an issue with renting a car before until now .
if someone lives in vegas why would you need a return flight ?
they refused to give me the car without the credit card or return flight .
like i said , i 've never encountered a problem before this .
so disappointed .
the bagels are just as good for less than half the price .
einstein 's turkey sausage sandwich was bland and the cheese was n't even melted .
she looks african american .
no a good value and my family does not really enjoy the food anymore .
i am sure the company is making more profit now though .
it is really sad to give this place a one star .
the people here a are completely rude and unprofessional .
he seemed so unhappy and hated life .
this review has nothing to do with the food .
are you kidding me ?
today 's visit was the same on top of losing my order .
disaster .
my son ended up being _num_ minutes late for a _num_ minute piano lesson .
i wo n't be back .
this place is ridiculous .
i ordered hot tea and a sandwich and it was almost $ _num_ !
it 's ridiculous !
have been here multiple times in hopes they get better but they do n't .
_num_ out of _num_ times messed my order up .
unfortunately they are closest einstein 's to me so in stuck .
there was no apology and i did n't get a receipt .
_num_ minutes !
avoid this location at all costs .
what else do you want ? ''
safe to say that customer walked out .
there was n't .
i wo n't be coming back .
btw the only saving grace to this whole experience was the very kind cashier .
just do n't waste your time coming to the location .
my nine year old sister could run the place more efficiently .
i was so disappointed with the service here .
the guy behind the counter was a complete jerk .
they messed up my order again for the 3rd time in a row .
met a friend this morning at 10am .
but it 's still empty .
but still nothing .
poor service .
and extremely pathetic response to a customer issue .
the worst einstein 's i have ever been to .
the staff seems frustrated just taking your order .
if you 're silly enough to stay be prepared for disappointment .
i would n't have given it any stars if that were possible .
bagels still alright here , but service has taken a turn for the worse .
slow , inattentive , and unfriendly .
i wish i could give this no stars .
the sandwich filling was stale .
gross .
however , the bagel was warm and soft ( ?
i should have known something was wrong with the first bite .
this place is terrible .
i wo n't be back .
worst experience here ever !
i ordered a toasted cinnamon bagel with cream cheese .
the manager processed my refund and did n't even offer a single apology .
the tables were dirty as was the bathroom and counters .
oh and there 's not a zero star rating huh ?
waited like _num_ minutes for a dozen bagels .
i had a bad experience when i was eating at their restaurant .
never go here unless you want to look like a boy .
this place is ridiculously unprofessional .
my hair was slightly below my breast .
when it came to my turn she rushed and only cut half my hair .
i hate this place !
very poorly run hotel .
if you want a deal this hotel is not it .
i booked _num_ rooms and was promised free premium room upgrades .
it 's $ _num_ for use of the atm .
they do n't have resort fees because they scam you on other stuff .
crap tables off the strip should be $ _num_ they are $ _num_ .
avoid this place like the plague .
in short , it felt a little dark .
if it were food , i 'd call it bland .
nothing special .
i ordered a groupon for two night with upgraded room option included .
the furniture was beat up , the toilet leaked all over the floor .
the place is a shit hole .
they were rock hard and tasted horribly .
the _num_ is for the comfy bed .
the first morning we did n't leave our room until around noon .
when we returned later that afternoon housekeeping had not been there .
the bartenders , horrible .
bad attitudes to say the least .
i will say , the chicken nachos were tasty .
the people in the neighboring room sounded like they were in our room .
the rest of the hotel is a joke too .
the carpet looks like it 's over _num_ years old .
i 'd rather stay at motel _num_ than have to stay here again .
i would give this place no stars if i could .
this has got to be the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in .
and do n't let me forget to also mention that the rooms stink !
do not stay here unless you like camping in the city dump !
i ate grilled salmon and broccoli from the paradise cafe located in the hotel .
i missed the last day of my work conference .
the amenities are mediocre at best .
do yourself a favor , do not stay here .
it is a low quality hotel was horrible customer service .
i wo n't stay here again !
zero stars .
they canceled my reservation for a non smoking room .
this attorney will take your money and work for the other side .
it 's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside .
do n't waste your time .
i would not recommend using them again as there was no customer service .
_num_ i was in a car accident .
i wish i can give them no stars .
the worst .
absolute joke .
not only did they do nothing .
very condescending attitude in the office .
then they charged me _num_ for sitting on my file .
such a waste .
we also added an order of spam musubi and two drinks .
total - over $ _num_ !
`` this is bad . ''
it was dry , flavorless , and ultimately , i think it was old .
moving onto the mac salad , this was a shame too .
again , tasteless .
there was no flavor whatsoever in this mac salad .
there was chunks of low grade tuna sitting in a sauce .
but nothing to rave about .
the spam musubi could use some serious improvement too .
the only good thing this time was the free refill on the drinks !
the spam musubi was no better because it was probably sitting out too long .
the seaweed did not break off as you tried to bite through the musubi .
the california ( `` the cal '' ) caters to hawaiian clientele .
chicken katsu is basically breaded and fried chicken , rolled and sliced .
it was ok , but not especially crisp or flavorful .
nothing was bad , but it was n't exciting either .
terrible service .
and the food was n't good either .
dry salmon , flavorless ramen , small portions .
no water refills at all .
but if you know the trick ... you can get your food fast .
do n't understand why people enjoy this restaurant so much .
however , after many chances , i will not come back here ever again .
we waited around _num_ minutes just to order our food around 11:30 am .
it was like the left over chicken with skin still left on it .
the curry was not strong enough either , so it tasted watery .
just overall bad experience here .
cheap food , but horrible .
( chicken breast is just so much healthier for you ) it was o.k .
just ok .
i ca n't think of anything really good about this place .
i mean whatever , i was so hungry i did n't care .
this used to be much better .
do n't get the poke .
it gave me food poisoning .
like seriously , it 's _num_ ... get with the program .
it also states that people should not sit until they have paid .
did not even bother to acknowledge me .
waste of my time !
beef teriyaki was a thin slide of a cheap steak and it was tough .
i spent more time on cutting it and chewing it than enjoying it .
chicken teriyaki was odd .
the breaded cover was loose and thick .
this restaurant serves in large amount of food but in less quality .
saimin was flavorless .
i only had a spam musubi for $ _num_ .
and it was too watery .
i like it a bit more dry .
the rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either .
-- no bueno .
i had the chicken dinner .
it was a lot of food , but the quality was horrible .
my chicken was _num_ % skin and fat .
i think the deep fried oreo down the street is better for you .
always try to stop by when i 'm in town .
they do have excellent food but the service has definitely fallen off .
i was really disappointed .
i took my receipt and sat down to wait .
no biggie .
no biggie .
a different ( older lady ) cashier looked at me like i was crazy .
she looked at me again like i was crazy .
i 've been waiting for my to go plate for like _num_ minutes !
in disappointment i took my meal and walked out of the casino .
every one looked like they hated their jobs .
the place was busy for lunch though .
this place is disgusting .
i have no idea how it gets a _num_ star .
all the meat was fatty and not of good quality .
gross .
also , what restaurant does n't take credit cards .
its the 21st century get with the program , its called running a business .
idiots !
i did n't eat much more than a dozen bites ... just kinda gross .
what a disappointment !
talk about false advertisement !
if you 're looking to order poke , look elsewhere .
wrong !
when we got our meals , no one left satisfied .
there was not a single sign or anything in the entire place .
so we just left .
fail .
yelp i 'm sorry but you let me down !
i do n't get how this place has so many good reviews .
first the tables block the entrance so you can barely enter the place .
signage is very bad and you ca n't even see it .
the sweet and sour ribs were n't even ribs , it was pork butt !
reasonably priced for the portions you get .
thing is that ... the food is n't very good .
but to walk / cab here from the strip , nah ... probably not .
i 'd rather eat at l & l .
it almost like the noodle i can make at home or worse .
we did n't like it .
i ordered _num_ chicken gravy bowls with extra gravy to go .
i am very unhappy with the food and how nasty it tasted .
anyway - some locals like to go the california to eat at aloha specialties .
won tons - too much dough .
al dente .
macaroni salad - made with too much mayo .
the prices here are reasonable , but the line was long .
in terms of hawaiian food , this place is a little disappointing .
it took us literally _num_ minutes just to get to the register to order .
they had only two girls working .
the total was $ _num_ .
thank you .
i got the chicken teriyaki sandwich with macaroni salad .
the sandwich was basic , but okay .
not for me .
i do want to return to try their oxtail soup .
no kidding !
terrible service !
went back in to explain and they said it was n't their fault .
too much faith in the consistency of the dry cleaning business .
i 'm only writing for the hotel portion .
horrible .
uncomfortable .
the oldest tv ever was in this room .
it was barely a color television .
no extra blankets or pillows .
two super thin , used a million times towels were given .
stupid , stupid me .
did i mention the parking ?
so come for some gambling , but definitely do n't stay for the hotel .
his response to me asking why he overcharged me ?
avoid this crap and head up the street .
if i could give this hotel a negative star rating , i would .
the customer service was absolutely horrible on the hotel side of things .
we were also required to leave a substantial deposit on the room .
terrible experience .
we were told over the speaker that it was a false alarm .
so alright , whatever , we go back to sleep .
we tried to stay away from our room as much as possible .
thanks for the uncomfortable stay !
the hotel -- finally -- is ( permanently ) closed .
you are really just a step above you 're ugly cousin , reno .
i sat in silence as i watched el hub and friends play craps .
i was n't willing to find out .
not really a breath of fresh air from fremont st .
thought it was going to be so cool to stay in old vegas .
i was excited & it was soooo cheap .
ugh .
the room itself was okay .
the air conditioning as loud , but barely worked .
i walked up to the bar , which had _num_ men behind it .
he still insisted that it must be paid for .
meanwhile , the manager looking fellow is just watching .
there were a bunch of cheap shirts for sale in the back lobby .
it was kind of sad .
i 've never stayed here and rarely even drop a single coin here .
the casino is small , old , and can use a makeover .
i do n't play here , eat here , or even stay here .
but no more .
casino is old , stale , and just ... weird .
it has n't improved one bit since my last review .
it 's actually gotten worse .
now , it 's become one of the worst places downtown .
horrid experience .
no more .
played the slots but lady luck was n't on our side .
the workers there are very surly and not helpful at all .
the servers are rude .
so why am i still so mad ?
we will not step foot back into that casino .
there is no hotel and one lousy restaurant .
there are no comps !
not to mention how bad the smoke is in there.
it 's just disgusting !
how the heck are you going to verify that i parked here anyway ?
stupid .
it 's super old school decor and smokey environment is a turn off .
i really wish i could leave a review with negative stars .
this review is n't about that .
no free parking .
the staff is rude .
they must all be miserable .
asked someone to validate our parking pass because we actually did gamble real money .
we passed by someone and i politely said , `` excuse me ? ''
she kept walking , if not faster , avoiding me .
she turned around and looked annoyed .
again , the staff has to be really miserable .
for the most part , the casino workers seemed over worked and grumpy .
it took over _num_ minutes to get a player 's card .
the dealers did n't seem to care whether she helped me or not .
seriously not worth the trouble !
do n't even bother wasting your time .
if you want class this is not your place .
ok casino , rude employees .
her response was that , no she was just standing there for her health .
who needs this hassle on vacation .
it 's the first time i barely tipped .
_num_ bucks for _num_ beers .
it really ruined the whole mood of our evening .
yay for a crappy first time visit .
in our opinion the food was significantly below par .
the hamburger was dry and generally not appealing .
omg at main bar at _num_ am and trying to get a drink .
he looked at our bill and said he would be back .
unfortunately we wo n't be back .
i was n't in a hurry as my husband was playing blackjack behind me .
i was n't rude about it , just stated a fact .
well , i was done and walked away .
there was no reason for him to not serve me .
i was buying beer with hard cold cash .
seems like that would be acceptable .
i mean , it is a bar too right ?
sorry that i was n't dressed like a working girl .
avoid this place at all costs .
three the food is the absolute worst especially their barbecue .
they pay _num_ to _num_ on their blackjack games .
i hate _num_ to _num_ .
it can create a problem like it did for us .
bits not a lot of money but that 's not the point .
it 's just not right .
i 'm not sure if we 'll come back .
weeks later received a letter stating that i owed an additional $ _num_ .
ticket was $ _num_ so i saved a total of $ _num_ .
this is exactly what i could have done myself for free !
located in a horrible part of town .
negative stars .
every inch of this property is filthy , shady , and in poor repair .
broken glass , broken door frames , filthy broken curtains , uneven floors .
negative stars !
i would n't recommend this establishment to anyone .
you are better off staying in a roach motel .
older than the hills and twice as dirty .
did n't expect much going into this place .
water was hot but there was a bug in the shower .
my boyfriend went to inform them and they were pretty rude to him .
this was a last minute place .
would n't stay here otherwise .
the owner was very rude .
please do not waste your money here .
when i asked him about it , he was rude and blew me off .
this is definitely a hole in the wall .
he was running around never said hi or anything .
do n't know if i will be back .
i was disappointed in my attempt trying to access this place .
this museum is such a disappointment .
fast forward _num_ years and nothing has changed .
it 's pretty harsh for me to give _num_ stars , but read on .
as a result , i have been to many children 's museums .
it 's only two floors .
vegas could support four floors easily .
we have n't lost you yet and it 's been almost _num_ years .
she just looked at me .
this place is very expensive .
my husband daughter and i were _num_ bucks .
i was like o.k this place should be pretty cool .
but all the displays were old and run down .
she says there is no one i can talk to with more authority .
she says there is no one i can talk to with more authority .
never again , even for free .
very sleazy joint .
do not stay here .
the area is not the most attractive .
whats wrong with you ?
im sure there are better hotel rooms available few blocks down .
i wish there was a way to leave a _num_ star review .
worst pawn shop ever !
$ _num_ in my pocket and none for you .
i came in here around _num_ and i was looking at a silver eagle .
the worse of the worse pawn store in the whole world .
walked out of the store like `` run for your life '' .
i took our family dog here to get put down because she had cancer .
i was pissed !
there was no reason for the attitude .
did n't ask or talk much at all .
worst experience ever .
the guy at the front was a total jerk .
rude staff , careless vet .
the place was very cheap looking and run down .
i feel so terrible for taking my poor dog here !
i did n't even make it to an appointment .
the receptionist was extremely rude .
horrific experience .
i just do n't see getting that kind of ambiance at the bellagio .
ca n't say the same for the hotel staff .
clearly someone is lying and i doubt it 's the booking company .
i 've had authentic italian food and this was no where near it .
i will never return unless it changes owners .
i will watch out on these reviews just in case things get better .
here 's the problem i have , the service is terrible at lunch .
i know they are packed and have never sat down to eat .
over the last year or so my order has been screwed up several times .
then it goes downhill from there .
after i called ahead at least _num_ mins .
giving them a total of _num_ mins to prep the food .
so i dream of the food and sadly make another choice .
however , lately management is really not doing his job .
after a couple of minutes the server brought me a cup with _num_ meatball .
i am from chicago and was married to an italian .
i ate a couple of bites , and that was all i could take .
it was also very bland .
i did n't eat it .
he ate it and said it was okay , but not spectacular .
it is not an inexpensive restaurant .
so maybe we just ordered the wrong things .
this place is soooo overrated .
server was busy hence slow but good .
i ordered the pasta with italian sausage .
let me preface this by saying i am not an overly picky eater .
what we got was unacceptable on every level .
the bread was more suited to be a croissant than italian bread .
neither the manager nor the owner was there .
i am amazed anyone can stay in business serving food this bad .
avoid at all costs .
chicago joes blows !
the entrees were horrible .
sadly this was not the case .
all in all this was a big disappointment and a waste of money .
food totally lacks in flavor .
sent it back and chose spaghetti with marinara .
tasted like someone poured on tomato paste and that was it .
absolutely no flavor or seasonings at all and for $ _num_ .
a waste .
the waiter spent _num_ % of his time on the telephone .
the waiter never returned during the meal to refill our glasses .
it did arrive long after the soup was totally cold .
the bread was too hot to even touch .
the seafood was ok , but the broth was greasy and watery .
the chicken was overcooked .
it supposedly had a bolognese sauce .
we will not be back !
unfortunately probably his last .
i ordered the stuffed artichoke as my entree .
all of our food was average to below average .
i 've only been for lunch and everything is drenched in red sauce .
i really did n't care for it .
this place was awful .
the atmosphere is about the only redeeming quality for chicago joe 's .
our waiter showed little concern for his guests .
very disappointed for dinner .
the artichoke appetizer was unappealing .
breading had no flavors .
my companion refused to use the facilities it was so gross .
not so now for dinner .
i doubt i 'll come back .
you lost a repeat customer , joes .
unfortunately the memories of the food quality did n't measure up .
but the food was poor .
salads ( w/ entrees ) were ok .
the pasta was filled with slices of raw , uncooked garlic .
and hey , no garlic !
ordered clams as an appetizer .
ordered the veal piccata , same thing !
the replacement side was over cooked and mushy .
i will not be returning .
the server was terrible and he only had one other table at the time .
the food is not good - not fresh & over priced .
chicago joe 's is a quaint little italian joint .
the salad and bread are nothing special .
i was in vegas visiting with some friends and they suggested this place .
the food left a lot to be desired .
i asked for linguini , and meatballs .
gave me regular pasta , and insisted it was linguini .
one star for the wine and the concept ... as for recommending this place ?
the service and the food were poor .
and if you are handicap , forget it if you need the restroom .
italian food is some of the cheapest food to make .
this place really did not have any of those things .
ambiance : chicago joe 's is basically in a converted old house .
the ladies bathroom does not have a handle on the inside .
but the food that i tried ... no .
not enough of the traditional spices .
i can not put my taste buds on what was exactly lacking .
it may have needed some more garlic , or some basil .
that just made it look very unappetizing .
and it tasted like my meatballs did ( bland ) .
i was very disappointed with chicago joe 's tonight .
this used to be a favorite lunch spot in downtown las vegas for me .
i was wrong on both accounts .
he never apologized just set the new bread on the table and walked away .
all said and done , very disappointing .
the waiter was good but the price was not worth the food .
by far the worst place i have eaten at i vegas .
the food was microwaved , not fresh , and disgusting .
let me tell you that my _num_ year old can make a better artichoke .
i do not recommend eating here .
the cons : way too pricey !
chicken parm was $ _num_ .
the chicken was very dry telling me it was way over cooked .
the stuffed ravioli was n't stuffed very much .
i would never return to this place .
terrible .
they do n't have bruschetta .
he said no one in vegas likes it .
umm , probably b/c they do n't know how to make it properly .
those dishes are $ _num_ per & way over priced !
i did n't like it at all .
this place is over priced & the food is terrible .
there was n't one thing i liked .
even a cheap chain italian restaurant probably would have been better than this food .
but i will not return .
i have eaten here for _num_ years and never had a bad meal ever .
i brought _num_ friends for lunch .
some of it was burning hot and the other part was ice cold .
not made fresh .
same thing with the salad and the lasagna was awful .
the sausage smelled bad .
i could n't eat it .
i really doubt i go back again .
it 's unfortunate .
we were recommended to this establishment but truly we should not have bothered .
sadly it was the latter .
price is fair i suppose for below average food .
really not worth the gas or time to go down town from henderson .
the bread was horrible .
same with chicken parm .
the red sauce was like out of a can .
waiter could care less .
never checked back with us .
very disappointed .
if you order a glass of wine , do n't .
dinners came on over sized plates , great no room .
we sent lasagne back and they accommodated another dish for my mother in law .
please do not associate this restaurant for anything chicago .
i 'm from that wonder city and i left confused .
the food is cheap , not bad , but not great .
whole wheat bread seemed like the fluffy wonder bread variety .
tamales were _num_ stars .
not good , not particularly bad either .
not for a family feast .
i mean , can we watch the news or at least nfl network ?
boy , i could hear the microwave all over the place .
i ordered # _num_ the famous pork tamale and the cheese enchilada .
it was very disappointing .
too much cheese on top of everything and salty .
the worst part ?
the terrible feeling i had in my tummy the rest of the day !
used to be a much better and friendlier place .
food was ok , not spectacular but not the worst i 've had .
my biggest complaint was the service - marginal , at best .
the masa is very bland and has no flavor to it .
salsa in the cheese tamales was not that good .
i guess i will have to keep looking for better tasting tamales .
we came back last week and were very disappointed .
the prices were increased from last time , and my favorite soup was changed .
upon ordering the soup , you get a condiment tray .
what the hell ?
i had used my fingers to grab the cilantro out .
was like creamed avocado dip .
actually , it was the worst .
the waiter did not tell me it would cost any more money .
i ca n't express enough how terrible service can lead to non repeat visits !
i do n't know how this place got these reviews !
this place stinks really bad .
the tamales were reheated several times and did not have a good flavor .
this place is way over priced .
they are trying to get hotel prices in a ghetto neighborhood .
i 'm sorry ... but i will never return .
they charge $ _num_ for microwave tamales ... .
those sinks are for hand washing only .
i saw a busser bus tables then go cook on the line .
unfortunately we were seated near the line where the servers pick up the food .
it was really inappropriate .
on a positive note , the food did n't suck .
used to be good _num_ years ago .
unfortunately , all four of us got sick after eating here .
clearly the place has gone downhill .
you have been warned .
so tonight we tried it .
the mix had no flavor , not lime or even sweet .
the menu said _num_ and there were only _num_ .
the fish was very over cooked .
there was supposed to be a mango salsa .
way too much butter .
my husband ordered a steak and enchilada plate with green sauce on the enchilada .
he did n't even finish his food .
he did n't bother to ask if there was something wrong .
honestly , by that time i just did n't care .
we sure have n't had much luck finding a good mexican restaurant here .
the food was mediocre at best .
it was too salty .
in a mexican restaraunt that makes killer tamales ... really ?
i probably will not return to that location at least .
i had the beef taco , chili relleno and a tamale .
worst place i 've ever ate at in my life !
$ _num_ for two people & the food was complete shit .
just looking at his tamale made me want to throw up !
the menudo was great but the tortillas unfortunately were not handmade .
what bothered me the most was that the owner argued that they were .
i would 've appreciated her honesty .
this was no way to treat customers whose bill was over $ _num_ .
disappointing .
the dinner special ( tamales , enchilada style ) was way too salty .
the tortillas were very obviously store bought ; they were served dry and hard .
the menudo was extremely bland .
the broth tasted like watered down ramen soup before you put the seasoning in .
the actual tripe was very soggy .
either way , it 's not the way i like it .
are we having a lime shortage again ?
no lime .
i leave this restaurant with a full stomach of that .
unfortunately nothing else left a great impression and we will not be returning .
very disappointed .
this was the worst experience ever !
there is no customer service at all .
i was not given what i ordered .
the quality of service and food has not been up to standards .
the worst taco ever .
food was great .
tamales were tasty and the rice tasted just like my moms .
customer service is terrible !
very disappointed !
mind you there are only two toilets and one was clogged , gross !
it looked like a restroom in tj !
i 'm sure that 's why it was smothered in the green sauce .
the refried beans had so much lard you could n't taste the beans .
sure enough she spent the whole night throwing up .
never , never will i go back to that sewer in the wall .
do not recommend .
horrible soggy mess .
looked and tasted like the had used the table salsa as their sauce .
not to mention waiter took out order and we never saw him again .
worst mexican food place in las vegas for sure .
will not revisit .
the fajitas were _num_ star ... so why just a _num_ star rating ?
otherwise the waitresses are lazy at their job .
very cold food .
the `` famous '' tamales were just gross .
the silverware looked to be dirty .
worst mexican food i 've ever tasted .
you 'll be disappointed .
low standards i guess .
overpriced and food is mediocre at best .
the customer service was horrible , hostess completely ignore my family .
waiter rude , horrible food .
very bad experience .
i tried to give them a chance and not get up and walk out .
i regret not walking out , it was just not good .
ordered half dozen chicken tamales and half dozen beef .
in order to get a credit i have to bring the wrong tamales back .
good food not great .
terrible service .
rude waitress .
will not be back .
came for lunch today and it was pretty terrible !
i had a _num_ item plate with a taco , tamale , and enchilada .
it was alright nothing special .
the tamale was ok and they use store bought taco shells for there tacos .
_num_ star minus _num_ star .
not among the best mexican restaurants in town .
my mom didnt care for hers and left most of it on the plate .
the establishment itself was beyond empty .
take out is not good .
my taco was a soggy mess and so was the shredded chicken .
runny and watery , it did not taste good at all .
all i could eat were the rice and beans .
this food was not fresh , even the salsa was nasty .
whatever you do , do not get your food to go .
i was totally blown away with their high prices and poor quality food .
ok so last sunday i called around _num_ to ask what time they closed .
customer service is number one priority .
staff is two clueless women .
mediocre mexican food and they take forever !
this is a really small shack on main street .
avoid at all costs .
i walked out both times .
it is a tiny square dining room , with maybe _num_ people in it .
the only thing that stood out was the sauce - everything else was ok .
the burrito was sorta small with a dash of green chili sauce .
disappointing for a $ _num_ lunch special .
not impressed .
i would rather eat at roberto 's and spend less money .
my wife 's salad was obviously old lettuce .
sorry to say , this is one restaurant whose time appears to have gone .
whatever the reason , i will not recommend this place again .
you 're choice of meet is ground beef , shredded beef and chicken .
there was no flavor and would be closely compared to a spicy marinara sauce .
i do n't blame them , i would n't order a second .
only one refill on a flat cup of soda ... no thanks .
it gives off that hole in the wall feel .
the food , is far below fair .
the shells were the packaged hard ones you can purchase at the grocery store .
the meat was ground beef with a very noticeable taco mix seasoning .
there was way too much lettuce .
i was very displeased .
the place was almost full so they must be doing something right .
the woman who said she was the owner ( theresa ) was actually rude .
i would recommend calling before heading down because they are n't open every night .
she also brought us some chips and _num_ kinds of salsas .
i have to admit , the salsa was n't the best .
the guacamole was not fresh and frozen .
gross .
very dry .
this is noted as the oldest mexican restaurant in vegas .
has the grill been cleaned recently ?
c'mon downtown vegas folks , you ca n't possibly like this place that much !
luckily , i was n't the one driving .
the server was friendly and helpful in answering our menu questions .
little respect for patrons .
but way over priced with poor quality food .
the food was awful .
the beans and rice were old and reheated .
my fajitas were cheap poorly cooked sliced chuck steak .
i just came back from my yearly trek to las vegas .
this trip was not so successful .
from my last visit the customer service was not there .
they have a big selection but their prices are too high .
i 'm new to the church and did n't realize how things work there .
i 'm not going back for sure .
you 'll get better service .
this place is the absolute worst !
well , the end of the four hours of waiting arrives and nothing .
no way he could repair anything .
this was the worst service company i have ever dealt with !
a couple days later , he calls and says he 's five minutes away .
he did n't get around to coming back until the next day .
to make a long story short they scheduled me an april 30th appt .
who 's responsible for this amateur unprofessional scheduling ... ... .
they do not care for your time and they 're _num_ % unprofessional .
do not use this place .
if i could leave zero stars i would .
then , when it comes in , someone will bring it out to us .
i had an appointment , no one showed up .
i had to wait until monday to call and talk to someone and reschedule .
someone was supposed to arrive by noon .
nope , i called and was told it would be closer to three .
so , i had to call again on wednesday .
worst customer service , if i could mark zero stars i would .
incredibly disappointed in this company .
my _num_ year old father contacted them to have a wine fridge repaired .
terrible customer service .
unacceptable .
do not let lowe 's send them to fix your appliances .
complete rip off !
if i could give a no star rating this company would get it !
you will be ripped off and lied too !
i am going to use another company .
i have contacted channel _num_ news to investigate this company .
complete and utter rip-off .
then told me i had to pay him $ _num_ for the call .
i refused .
the problem happened christmas day .
the manufacturer referred me to brownies .
lousy service unprofessional have no clue what they are doing .
this company was so bad that my warranty company no longer will use them .
this place is the original casino cafe in las vegas .
located on the end of the fremont street experience .
always busy & crowded on the weekends .
the atmosphere is nostalgic with old school decor .
( used to be _num_ cents ) .
no salt on food .
the parking sucks also .
i would advise everyone to stay away from this place .
we had to wait until the next day to file a report with security .
do not stay here unless you want to lose cash forever .
if you like paper thin walls , then this is your place !
i did hear numerous conversations though , and they were clear as a bell .
avoid this .
the snack bar had long been famous for its _num_ shrimp cocktails .
a couple years ago the price went to $ _num_ .
the shrimps are small and bland to the point of being almost tasteless .
finally , he asks me what i want to drink .
i was there from august 6th to 9th .
every morning , my room would fill with cigarette smoke from my neighbors .
the room was very small , and only had a full sized bed .
there was no desk available in the room .
we stayed at the golden gate for halloween .
this round was slightly less impressive .
the room was hot during the day and freezing at night .
furthermore , it would not be .
unacceptable all around .
it used to only cost $ _num_ a night to stay here .
i really hate how things change so quickly in vegas .
it is also very noisy and you can hear everything on the street .
the casino and cheap drinks were cool though .
if you 're staying at the hotel , parking is free .
as for the sleep quality , it was terrible !
the walls were paper thin .
the shower was so gross .
there is absolutely no counter space where the sink is .
not to mention the bathroom was so small !
i would not recommend the standard room of this hotel .
take your money next door to the plaza .
do not stay in a regular room .
the price is very cheap , but not worth it .
golden gate casino is not what i remembered it to be years ago .
i have n't stay in their rooms so i ca n't judge them .
only highlight is at night outside this joint .
i would .
golden gate hotel wins worst hotel ever award !
bad idea to pick the golden gate hotel .
the second room was much better .
i could n't believe how big it was .
i made the mistake of looking up .
please do n't waste your time or money .
it 's not worth it .
she was rude .
stayed thursday , friday , and saturday night ; did n't get any sleep !
i ended up purchasing ear plugs to get some sleep .
also , our tv did n't work the entire _num_ days we stayed there .
`` there are cockroaches everywhere its the desert . ''
( two different amounts . )
the second thing i noticed was the cockroach on the wall of the bathroom .
used soap that was n't ' mine , in the shower .
uh , ok .
it was only one , and i 'm a push over .
just charge it to your room .
it was breakfast and i was hungry so that sounded like the perfect solution .
so we sat down at the table and ordered a sprite and a coffee .
she tried to charge us for _num_ coffees .
so why _num_ stars ?
i have no intention of staying here again .
maybe i can find a place downtown that does n't ' have cockroaches ?
similarly , on another show , a _num_ cent giant hot dog was presented .
they were cold , watery , and completely flavorless .
probably would n't stay again .
the sleeping area is recently renovated and decent , but the bathroom is horrible .
tiny , dark shower with nowhere to put your shampoo , etc .
there 's no pool , no wifi , no spa , etc .
what , exactly , is the resort fee going towards ?
stayed here one night .
bad bad bad .
this trip was the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
calling downstairs got me an apology and a maintenance guy .
it was a sauna in the room the first _num_ nights .
it 's literally _num_ feet from our window .
my fiance had to play maintenance guy and fix it so we could sleep .
you can not opt out .
you can not park there on weekends , you must valet on weekends .
our room did not have a fridge .
so if that bothers you then you might not want to stay here .
paying the _num_ % more of the room rate for resort tax is absurd .
this happens no where else .
i hate this place !
i discovered that they charge a resort fee of $ _num_ per night .
they do n't even have a pool .
this is a shame that they are charging this ridiculous fee .
on this stay we learned they are now charging a $ _num_ resort fee !
verdict : terrible !
the room was so tiny !
no place to put anything other than that tiny bar of soap !
i could barely turn around in the shower it was so small .
the sink was cracking and so were the bathroom tiles .
what really got me was the small room .
yes it was cheap but the resort fee was absolutely ridiculous .
the tiny shower and overall feel of the room was really bad .
to top it all off the walls were painted a really ugly color .
it was just bad !
but this was too much of a dive .
i will definitely not be back !
ugh , this place is a nightmare .
i expected noise but this was literally like sleeping through a rave .
if i could give this place a zero i would !
please skip this hotel and go to circus circus or some other budget hotels .
i believe this is a bed bug infested hotel which requires immediate attention .
this is the first and last time i 'm ever staying here .
someone compared it to a locker room shower in another review here .
the music only took a two hour break from maybe 4am to 6am .
we checked out early and went elsewhere to sleep .
this made the room smell pretty stale .
so small you could n't walk around the bed even .
my overall impression is skip it .
guest rooms remodeled in _num_ , the guest bath rooms remodeled in _num_ .
windows in guest room didnt shut or lock .
_num_ a night hotel fee , _num_ a day wifi fee .
no bell hop , i dont think we will stay there again .
i wish i could give this a - star rating .
the room was cheap and that 's pretty much what you get .
a large person would not function with this set up .
_num_ % chance i 'll return .
the room also smelled awful and not all of the lighting worked .
golden gate was the worst hotel experience i have ever had .
i had booked it for _num_ nights to experience the fremont scene .
summary : no thanks .
unfortunately the security staff could be better .
other than front desk i did n't feel that here .
terrible !
not worth anyone 's time .
i would actually give them a negative star .
the experience was horrible .
the housekeeping was also horrible .
they left existing food on the ground and did n't remove the old towels .
if you want any real advice never stay here stay at the golden nugget .
dear golden gate your security need to get that chip off their shoulder .
are you effing kidding me ?
if i could give you zero stars i would .
shame on you .
this not being mentioned was part of the reason why we picked this hotel .
basically just enough room for the furniture and for you to get around it .
but the shower was probably the worst part .
the room was very small , which was fine .
the bathroom was a hot mess .
but for one night , i could deal with stuff like this .
my big issue is where the room was located .
directly beside my room was a stage .
it was annoying , but i guess you get what you pay for .
it was n't a terrible experience .
but i will not be staying at the golden gate hotel and casino again .
we check in and the hotel and casino is n't that bad .
lazy bartenders .
the golden gate is a rip off .
the same order cost $ _num_ dollars .
i 've been coming here for _num_ years to eat .
on halloween night me and some friends came in before a party .
i told them to screw off and we all walked out .
went to golden nugget where we spent our money .
casino actually nicer than i thought it would be .
horrible !
check in is 3pm ( like anywhere else ) we arrive at 3pm .
i 'm sorry !
but at the golden gate it 's not .
horrible service !
the room should have been cleaned by _num_ knowing more people are coming .
this hotel is the worst hotel i 've ever stayed .
i came here for relax but it totally ruined .
trust me this is the worst hotel .
do n't stay here .
yes that is _num_ hours of very loud music and loud people !
it is still old and tired looking .
in both rooms the bed and pillow need to be replaced .
not sure why at night there is very little hot water .
i will not stay here again .
nothing good to say about golden gate .
the room was straight out out of the _num_ 's .
ridiculously small , the shower had no light , pitch black .
not a burned out bulb mind you , no light .
horrible !
however , i must warn against staying at this as a hotel .
just do n't stay in the hotel .
so we obviously left and went elsewhere .
we stayed at the golden gate in mid february _num_ .
first off , we stayed in a deluxe queen room on the 2nd floor .
the bathroom had a sliding door ... not very much privacy .
it was roomy and upgraded ; this was the highlight of our stay here .
that really rubbed me the wrong way .
wtf ever , i pay the _num_ extra .
nightmare , do n't stay there , never stay there .
horrible horrible run down hotel .
please do not stay here .
there where dead bugs !
disgusting .
i stopped in here with my husband to do a bit of gambling .
she had just finished rudely yelling `` do n't touch the chips ! ''
everyone at the table was noticeably uncomfortable by her attitude .
bad experience .
this is anything but a resort .
none of the vending machines are stocked .
sign says western union .
sign says $ _num_ slices .
the floor is disgusting , the only thing people were buying was booze .
wifi code given by the front desk also did n't work .
after all , this is the 5th barber shop she 's `` owned . ''
please do not get your hair cut here !
as long as the she devil is cutting , stay far away .
what a dump and even worse service .
save your time and do not go to this barber .
most of that time was just chatting , not actually working or doing anything .
the entire experience was the most awkward and weird haircut of my life .
she then proceed to charge me $ _num_ !
just rude & unprofessional !
what an unpleasant experience .
so she is a liar as well .
avoid at all costs !
i am torn about this place .
here 's thing , there 's the good and the bad ... .
it just means there 's not much else around .
choices are limited downtown and this is one of the better eats .
i find this place to be dirty .
my friends know that i try to stay away from the salad bar .
it 's not the food that 's the issue but their plates .
it 's plastic and they do n't wash it very well .
yeah totally gross huh ?
it 's just plain unappetizing .
also , depends on what you order , the food can be really greasy .
i do n't recommend coming here for breakfast .
these are really good and they quickly sell out before the noon hour .
there 's always good and bad items on all restaurant menus .
the service was bad .
the food was worse .
i would not eat here again no matter how hungry i was .
the fruit was not fresh .
they did smile while giving us crappy food though .
i will never eat at the restaurant again .
working down the street , i used to be a regular .
i can not believe the way i was treated .
i tried to love this little place , i really did .
do yourself a favor and avoid this place .
you will leave frustrated and unhappy with the food and the service .
terrible .
this shelter desperately needs better management and a thorough clean up .
this place is a disgrace to call themselves a shelter .
this is a kill shelter ... please help get these babies out of here .
this place at first was upsetting .
my son left my door open and our dog ran away .
the lady at the counter again quoted me policies and then showed paper work .
but sadly i do n't think i will come back .
i had to leave _num_ messages to finally get a phone call back .
do not trust this place !
took a cat in and he was put down in _num_ hours .
they did n't try to do anything .
everyone that actually worked there was standing around .
i do not know how to feel about the animal foundation .
the animal foundation is in the pet killing business .
the cages they have them in are disgusting and the animals look miserable .
if no rescue wants him , then he will be put down .
flash forward to saturday , i call to check his status .
no call back .
i called sunday , no call back .
i called monday , no call back .
the manager could n't find the dog by his number .
she stated there was something wrong with his teeth .
he was put down monday .
if there was a negative any stars i would leave them .
if you start asking questions , you get very rude answers .
do not trust this place !
again , do not trust this place !
terrible !
dont bring a dog here unless you want to kill it .
no stars if i could .
terrible place .
i was freaking cause i have _num_ other dogs .
anyone who treats animals like they do needs to be shut down .
and all i got was a sorry .
more reason to think she was either abandoned or wo n't be claimed .
this is not right .
because some of them were sick .
needless to say that approach did n't work .
that 's horrible !
( beware this post is long ) .
not the worst experience .
she always responded quickly and efficiently .
but she left after a couple of months .
this is where it starts going downhill , y'all .
they said it was a mistake and he was removed the next day .
i said no , it was n't there .
and that is n't the end of it .
rude !
rude and shady .
i did register for the volunteer program , and signed up for upcoming event .
this was very disrespectful with no regards to my time .
i am not a volunteer because of _num_ ) and _num_ ) .
i 'm more than displeased with the care of my animal at this shelter .
i would not recommend this shelter for boarding or the care of your animal .
very disappointed in this facility .
i recently had to put my pet down due to an aggressive cancer .
i was upset and angry .
this will be the last time i attempt to adopt from this shelter .
the animal foundation was a terrible experience for us .
each time we were treated quite rudely by people in the cat area .
there is no excuse for the rudeness .
i should have gotten a hard clue from that .
when we got it home , it was sick the next day .
it did not cover the test or medication which was $ _num_ .
and we wo n't be treated rudely again .
they would not let us stay with her for the shots .
the man who took her for the shots was rough taking her from us .
this is the most awful shelter i 've ever experienced .
zero stars !
it 's horrific !
been here twice and both times the same lady was so unbelievably rude .
i asked for _num_ sets of the _num_ mini donuts .
he was not helpful or kind .
the attitude was n't really the top reason for this negative review .
i do not recommend this place for children events at all .
but this one really was a disappointment .
and pretty lame .
but it does n't .
but it has very little to do with local natural history .
took me _num_ minutes to see the whole thing .
but at least it was n't crowded .
$ _num_ per person ?
not with the money imo .
disappointed every time .
but sadly after this experience i do n't think i 'll be coming back .
in the end my hair was a complete joke !
there was no form and nothing blended .
not exactly how i wanted but she did the best she could .
he was the most disrespectful rude person .
its too smokey for me .
sometimes its too loud to talk or hear anyone .
this place would n't even exist if it was n't for live music .
ive ate there a couple times & i would n't advise doing that either .
we one that we probably should have skipped .
too interested in the regulars sitting playing video poker .
but this leads me too the prices !
where as a local bar in my area , would be half that price .
it was really loud .
it was so loud that i used my hands to communicate .
place was empty and i was the only one near the bar .
a short preface : i 'm a dumb ass .
not good .
most of the patrons were missing key teeth .
i was glad that i 'd gained _num_ lbs .
just a depressing place , no reason to go there .
for god 's sake , do n't walk there at night .
he said , `` probably , but why would you want to ? ''
the tourist rarely venture this far east downtown and for good reason .
yay for cheap liquor !
boo for the patrons who also enjoy cheap liquor !
cracking jokes , cordial , attentive despite being busy .
however , the other patrons were ridiculous .
the drinks are cheap .
it is two blocks east of 7th on fremont .
you do n't walk past 7th , you do n't look past 7th .
i was less than pleased with the shave .
dirty nasty ugly complex .
bad kids loud all day and night everyone smoking weed !
not a dive bar !
& it was free parking , thats hard to come around downtown .
cozy lil bar further down fremont street .
cocktails were too sweet or sour and i 'm not a big fan of .
the end of the bar was totally neglected .
unfortunately , this is where my group was .
it was poor service ... no excuses .
the actual bar is just a little further down fremont street .
service also sucked !
bartenders had no system going on and they were everywhere .
this place smells , is in a crappy location and was a total dive .
when we arrived i was immediately disappointed .
worst bar downtown !
here 's why i gave them one star .
the following week , i was shocked that i was charged $ _num_ .
_num_ star only because they did have a good crowd .
worst customer service ever .
people are rude on the phone .
can we say rude and super unprofessional ?
worst phone communication ever and they messed our order up twice .
take a hike and find another place to get your services and parts from !
ridiculous !
holy hell .
they have apparently since changed hands a couple of times and been renovated .
you should know better than to trust strange people on the internet anyway .
crappy hotel , but you ca n't beat _num_ bucks a night .
dive city !
it 's downtown , so you may not ever want to try this place .
you could n't pay me to stay here again .
decent location , cheap price on hotels.com .
it was like 6am permanently in this room .
the walls are thin so you hear everything _num_ .
wo n't be recommending this hotel or coming back here again !
probably just me though .
if i could give no stars i would .
the restaurant is also disgusting and filled with cigarette smoke .
the only plus is the free wi-fi .
the bed is really firm .
we did n't spend much time there because it seemed kind of sketchy .
i ca n't complain too much because once again it was a cheap stay .
the lighting in the room was horrific !
the ac did n't know how to operate .
i only stayed here because a friend referred it .
, everything is ridiculous !
, its stupid !
they r just a lie & no help !
this hotel is a piece of crap !
bad hotel !
bad service !
bad people !
bad security !
bad parking !
there is no _num_ .
whatever ... $ _num_ a night .
again , $ _num_ a night .
the reason i chose this hotel this time was for the $ _num_ blackjack .
cheap is cheap but it 's not always good .
so she placed me in another room and boy that room is falling apart .
so their is no point in the card system for the elevator .
this hotel needs to learn more customer service skills .
the classic dive casino that i used to bring all my friends too .
i am going to have to find another classic dive .
kinda scary but not the worse .
it 's almost like every greyhound is in a seedy area though .
seedy areas for a shady company .
there was no tickets there for me .
it was _num_ minutes until the bus was leaving .
tried an atm , my card is completely frozen .
so _num_ extra hours plus the _num_ 1/2 to get there .
i was gon na make it for dinner if i rushed from the station .
he looked but no action .
turns out , it was n't that bad .
it was worse .
anyways , i got on that bus , and it sucked so much .
thankfully , this bus was much more spacious .
no wonder no one likes riding the greyhound bus .
i had to wait _num_ hours for the next bus to leave at midnight .
if can avoid taking this bus to travel i will .
only good stars greyhound gets is the prices .
there is absolutely no organization here whatsoever .
the bus itself was very old .
for the most part , the passengers were quiet and just kept to themselves .
words can not describe their low quality buses and service .
he just looks at me like wtf ?
that explains the piss smell that everybody on here is mentioning in their reviews .
big mistake .
it is as bad as they say in these reviews !
i was lucky enough to get placed on a newer express model bus .
worst experience ever .
never , ever , ever again !
the new security guard company set up is a joke .
all in all , this place is going down hill fast .
there is a sign near the door that says no smoking within _num_ feet .
nonetheless , the reservation clerks were helpful and polite in getting me a ticket .
so so so bad experience .
when we asked at the customer service they do n't give a fuck .
its your typical awful greyhound .
what a load of crap .
what a waste of time and money .
it left an hour late and the trip took _num_ hours .
the most disrespectful , rude , arrogant people working there .
these people have no respect for themselves , their job or other people !
i will never buy a ticket from this place again !
they dont even deserve one star !
horrible !
i can not express how disgusted i am .
very bad service .
then they told him bus is full so you ca n't go .
does n't end here .
they said he could go in the next bus which was at _num_ pm .
it arrived at _num_ pm and left at _num_ pm !
they did n't have any bus after _num_ pm .
they were not helpful at all !
no where to sit down , floor is dirty as f @ $ # !
i took a transfer bus in los angeles ( la ) .
the trip back was so much worse .
_num_ ) there was a ton of traffic from lv to la .
_num_ ) the bus broke down .
the bus actually broke down in the desert !
we were stuck there for _num_ hours .
_num_ ) the second bus arrived .
_num_ ) the second bus had no a/c .
reading lights were also broken .
but i was n't there when it happened , so i have no idea .
can you imagine getting kicked off in the middle of nowhere at night ?
_num_ ) i was scheduled to arrive in la at 5:30 pm .
instead , i arrived at _num_ pm .
_num_ ) i called for compensation .
they were willing to compensate me for the hours delayed .
it takes _num_ business days .
overall , i think i was pretty lucky this time .
it could have been a lot worse .
i could have been stuck in the desert for who knows how long .
or i could have been stuck in la .
very very slow service .
customer service is no here at all .
that 's not right .
use this as your last resort to go home .
first of all , they 're continuously running late .
nor is the wifi .
two of the three things the bus is supposed to have .
if i could leave zero stars , i would .
i tried hitting `` return '' to return my money , and guess what ?
no water for me but they will have my money anyways .
basically , greyhound sucks !
this is the worst experience i have ever had in my life .
i 'm currently traveling from san diego to pittsburgh .
i 'm supposed to be in pa in _num_ days and _num_ hours .
i 'm barely out of cali and it 's already been _num_ hours .
the employees communication skills are awful .
the staff on the desk are incompetent .
the line is a one hour wait just to get my baggage checked in .
bus driver is a character .
if you 're coming from vegas , do not ride here .
this place is horrible .
the staff is rude and totally incompetent .
jose was horrible and is a poor excuse for a customer representative .
talk about a real bad time .
worst experience ever .
rude staff rude driver .
you all need major customer service training asap .
yah no thanks grumpy old man .
the bus was late to and from vegas .
horrible experience !
to begin the customer service was horrible !
this bus trip is the worst ride i 've ever had in my life .
staff members are rude and they do n't even try to solve problems .
also , few passengers are rude as hell too .
so i 'm reviewing all of greyhound , not just one specific location .
boy was i wrong .
first i 'll start with the worst thing .
so my husband and i got separated and could n't sit together .
lame !
i had absolutely no leg room .
it was very awkward .
the chairs were so small and very uncomfortable .
i could not sleep or relax at all .
i just hated the whole experience .
i was annoyed and bummed but whatever , rules are rules .
no such luck .
heck no .
i just want to rate this place the most depressing place on earth .
are all greyhound bus stations this sad ?
i will never use the greyhound again , it was awful .
greyhound is the black hole of happiness .
( i was shipping plastic bins ) .
i was unsatisfied with all aspects of their customer service process .
save yourself the trouble and fly with rates so low .
i would give zero stars if the option existed .
very bad service .
then they told him bus is full so you ca n't go .
does n't end here .
they said he could go in the next bus which was at _num_ pm .
it arrived at _num_ pm and left at _num_ pm !
they did n't have any bus after _num_ pm .
i shipped _num_ boxes .
it never happens , and i called and talked to several employees .
it 's cheaper , but not if they loose all your stuff .
the worst customer service ever .
this is my first time riding greyhound and it was the worst service ever .
i will not be riding here ever again .
you ppl need some customer service training big time .
what kind of establishment sells packaged drinks these days and has no coconut water ?
`` and , get rid of the fucking coconut water .
and cost $ _num_ .
bad neighborhood , thin mattresses .
you are better off spending the extra money staying anywhere else .
seriously do n't stay here if you can help it .
the rooms are sooo old , dark , and ugly .
they have the worst mattresses full of bed bugs .
if you can avoid this place .
cons : it 's cheap .
this was my first trip to vegas .
i live in hawaii , so of course i stayed at the cal .
were less than helpful .
not so .
the entire hotel smells like smoke !
your kids will end up getting sick .
we checked in today only to find our thermostat broken .
it would only blow cold air .
she even seemed annoyed that we were bothering her .
we asked again -- surely there was something else they could do .
she was n't the person we spoke with on the phone .
this did n't need to be a big deal .
your poor handling of the situation made it a big deal .
in my opinion , the california hotel falls into the latter category .
for me , its like this - there 's a stain on your carpet .
i just called to make a reservation and these people are usually friendly .
but this one lady was so rude .
so she apparently took it out on me .
we checked in our room and the room was not vacuumed .
bad service .
in a casino you are allowed to smoke cigarettes .
i felt very uncomfortable .
if there was a _num_ rating i would give it that .
trash on floor .
stayed here for _num_ nights .
this time however , the rooms were not clean .
loud and smoky like most downtown casinos , except main street station next door .
first impressions count and the front desk staff are n't the friendliest .
the whole place is dirty and grimy much like the surrounding downtown area .
the maid did n't do the best job in cleaning our room .
the maid replaced the linen but never bothered to vacuum .
i spoke in her native korean and she walked out .
they charge _num_ per day per device !
lousy .
the maid service was awful once we were there .
staff friendly but i would n't go back .
i get to our room and there 's no coffee or internet .
this really sucks .
first time staying here and never will again .
got in at _num_ am exhausted from a long day of travel .
checked closer and it was a blood stain on two of my pillow cases .
then found a beer bottle cap and other garbage underneath my bed .
not thrilled .
so , it 's not possible to give less than one star ?
i honestly was n't and still am not convinced .
horrible customer service !
this is poor customer service !
had a very bad experience .
the charge for the hotel was completely messed up .
she was also very condescending .
horrible !
so i walked to the next employee , an older white lady .
maybe ask one of the _num_ filipino ladies to hold him for a minute ?
so ... let me get this straight .
children are allowed in the restaurant but not in the gaming area .
worst in las vegas !
the entire hotel reeks of cigarettes .
worst vegas experience ever .
i stayed here for _num_ night .
there was no internet .
never again !
maid service is sloppy .
there 's not really anything to do at the hotel .
not enough slot machines , only old boring ones .
and if it gets windy good luck trying to sleep !
the only positive is that this hotel is relatively cheap .
worst experience ever .
very very rude !
no costumer service at all .
u did n't think i was gon na let that go !
u are very lucky i did n't make u loose ur job !
i paid for _num_ _num_ piece orders of chicken nuggets and two chicken sandwiches .
it was really disappointing .
i did n't even eat anything .
but he did not have any generic cats in stock .
perhaps the worst food experience i 've ever had .
it 's decent pizza and quite cheap , especially for vegas .
the positives end there .
a few hours later , i was as sick as i 've ever been .
are you kidding me ?
it wo n't be in my dreams , and i wo n't be back .
total disappointment .
uncle joes once gave me the meatball and slice of my life .
not anymore .
they put wings and philly cheese steak on the menu instead ?
pizza was nothing like before .
very sad to lose this love of ours in vegas .
uncle joe , what happened ?
one of the most uncomfortable experiences ever .
shame on that dude .
i did n't do much homework before going inside .
i quickly go on yelp to see what the rating is .
the yelp ratings read _num_ stars and it 's not .
wearing an elvis costume eating bad pizza on halloween .
sorry i ca n't understand the game , i never played it .
so , my husband and i were drawn in by the _num_ cent margaritas .
i immediately informed the bartender of the error .
they did n't offer us a new room at any point .
this hotel is a run down , smelly , seedy place !
prices are super cheap so , guess you get what you pay for .
the buffet here is not so great .
the price is cheap for one , but the food has no flavor .
even the cocktail sauce for the cold shrimp was bland .
bad hotel .
casino is nasty .
food is horrible .
drinks are bad .
stay here if your real cheap and dont mind lousy casinos .
it would take a good _num_ minutes to get down to the lobby .
she was very apologetic and asked if she could still help .
the damn beds were too small for two people .
how could they actually give you a shrimp cocktail for $ _num_ ?
it 's two spoons of micro shrimp over cocktail sauce over shredded celery .
all in all , the eatery is meh .
it was a complete nightmare !
boy o boy ... .
this place has gone way downhill .
it 's centrally located to everything on fremont st and easy to access .
the room i stayed in had a bathroom sink that did n't drain .
_num_ times in the afternoon and once again in the evening .
most of the are miserable , act miserable and look miserable .
there are maybe two that do look like they are not bitter tho .
i would definitely not recommend this casino to anyone looking to have fun .
secondly , we went to the buffet , which we did daily .
literally , we waited _num_ minutes and the line was out the door .
meanwhile , breakfast time had ended and lunch started .
my largest problem was the room size .
even the desserts were no good .
i am so sad that this happened to me at my favorite place .
supervisor said collect all the cards and do n't pay anyone .
security told me not to call police , that they 'd handle everything .
well ... ... no self parking to begin with .
hallways are narrow and short so never a long walk from the elevator .
if i could , i would absolutely give them _num_ stars .
as for customer service they are very rude !
i was not about to risk my health and my daughters health .
no gym .
room was n't clean .
this casino is horrible !
they did n't say or do anything about it .
fremont hotel is not the place to stay in downtown las vegas .
there is no pool & the place could use a renovation .
pool has no appeal .
we wo n't stay here again .
horrible !
customer service bad , room service sucks !
then , he comes back 7am , hello .
i hate writing bad reviews , but i just had to in this case .
they come across as snotty and rude .
we got a comp room and it honestly was not worth it .
no luck on the tables or slots either .
however , there are other casinos that we 'll probably visit instead .
there was no need for that comment .
but with said he told me next time do n't ask for this room .
i would advise not staying at the fremont .
_num_ floors with popcorn ceiling and poor ventilation .
if you are a non smoker , stay away .
old room , small bathrooms and ugly decor .
the staff were friendly and helpful which is why it received _num_ stars .
the smoke in this place is sooooo thick .
the most rude staff i ever encountered somewhere .
only after begging they gave them .
it 's depressing .
no thanks .
the attendant walked by our vehicle , did n't acknowledge us .
after almost waiting _num_ minutes to get helped , we left .
the most rude staff i ever encountered somewhere .
only after begging they gave them .
_num_ out of _num_ only because i won some money .
this is a better place to play than a place to stay .
recently booked a room here .
same rate no comps for time or hassle .
so wrong on so many levels .
no attempt to make it right .
horrible experience here .
it really is pathetic .
i forgot how , what a horrible place this hotel is .
the smell is terrible in the hallways , and smell like urine .
i do n't know how this hotel is still in business .
just terrible and gross .
do n't waste your money stay somewhere else .
the room , and the front desk guy horrible .
the bartender vincent was serving customers as we arrived .
not just what 's in front of him .
plenty of other watering holes in vegas .
only staying one night and so far spent _num_ minutes trying to check in .
one of them is the fremont hotel and casino .
they serve oxtail soup late night ( after 11pm ? )
my cousin had put down a bet which the dealers did n't pay .
another manager came over to us to try to smooth things over .
any vegas casino would appreciate my action .
this was one of the most horrible hotels i have ever stayed at .
i 'm recommending that none of my friends and family stay here .
never again ... .
booked this hotel in september for a january stay .
the place reeks of cigarettes .
the room was ok , priced correctly for what we got .
it 's noisy at night too .
do n't stay here .
so i booked online , requested the two bed deluxe .
showed them our reservation , check in was easy .
i wait another hour and call customer service .
avoid this crap hole , i know i will .
worst hotel experience in my life .
the wifi is $ _num_ per device .
the worker who worked at the steak station in the buffet was so bad .
it seemed like he hated his job .
do not stay at this hotel .
the housekeeping stole _num_ from my hard working father .
they told him they would investigate .
let me first start by saying that i hate leaving negative reviews .
this review is for the casino only .
this hotel however is not .
the place wants _num_ bucks a day per device for wifi .
the wing for our room involved stairs to carry your bags .
for example , dirty , weird , and very loud in your hotel room .
no quiet time whatsoever .
we wo n't ever stay there again , and we do n't recommend it !
manager was polite but didnt do anything but put us in another room .
just eh .
customer service is trash there , never going again .
been here many times over the years , but will not go back .
you can spend the same elsewhere and have a much better experience .
food was not as good as flemings .
but the mediocre food could not make up for all of the above .
i did n't care very much for the texture or flavor .
do not waste money or time .
this place was not blowing your socks away or being pampered type of place .
_num_ queens will also charge for parking even if u valet .
there were people in jeans drinking bud lite everywhere !
we did n't get any sorbet after salad so maybe they stopped doing that ?
i dunno .
_num_ minutes later bill finally arrived .
ridiculous !
too expensive .
i will not go back .
i went there on a saturday night recently during a boys trip to vegas .
this place is horrible !
all they want you to do is pay and get the hell out .
very rude and outrageous prices !
it was okay but nothing like i was hoping it would be .
this was too old-fashioned for me with mediocre food .
it was my favorite restaurant in las vegas for that period .
hopefully something did not chance permanently , we will try it one more time .
then it went downhill .
so the plate came back hot , while the steak was still cold .
they ended up charging us _num_ dollars for the salad he ate beforehand .
_num_ dollars .
this place reminds me of a bad _num_ 's movie .
after a little more research i discovered that reviews on hugo 's were stellar .
however , i ca n't say that i completely agree .
the food , however , was nothing to brag about .
more exotic lettuce choices would have been a plus .
the tomatoes were mushy and lacked much flavor .
the shrimp were small ( far from jumbo ) and dry .
the filets were mediocre .
we also tried the creme brle which was just average .
otherwise it is not worth the trip to old las vegas .
you now only get _num_ .
_num_ minutes later , they bring our dishes .
they lost my business forever and anyone else i ever chat with .
we got the lobster bisque and the seafood trio .
it ended up taking close to _num_ minutes before everyone had their salad .
the seafood trio was also a disappointment .
the crab cake also was a let down .
all said we did not even come close to having half of the meal .
in addition this was not done at security but instead beside our table .
the service is horrible , hence why it 's getting _num_ stars from me .
the manager is extremely rude and not at all accommodating .
idiot .
i 've never been spoken to so rudely .
not sure we would visit again .
lemon sorbet that is served between the salads and entrees .
no ordering of sides separately ( also listed on negatives ) .
service for bread and water
atmosphere : very dark , old feeling , and very small place .
service : the waiter had broken english so it was hard to understand him .
he did not make any recommendations .
the gentleman did not recommend any salad or describe any of the dressings .
the entre sides were a stuff tomato , veggies , and mashed potatoes .
this was the most disappointing places we have ever been to .
we have been to many expensive steakhouses and this by far is the worst .
way too old school and average for the price .
we had the worst time at hugo 's cellar !
the sommelier did n't come by for _num_ minutes !
we were not happy from the beginning .
when we saw the prices of the meals , it just got worse .
not worth the price .
the sommelier was n't sympathetic .
that 's it ... no comp or anything .
i thank them for ruining my evening on fremont street .
the only reason that i gave them _num_ stars is because of the service .
this food was way over priced for the quality .
sorry to say i will never go back to hugo 's .
this place is very over rated .
i ca n't believe how in the hell this is _num_ star establishment .
no big deal .
entrees were accompanied by overcooked veggies and lackluster mashed potatoes .
the only high points were the salad prepared tableside and the shrimp cocktail .
sub-par service and food .
very disappointed considering the choices we had in vegas .
my wife and i went there on saturday night before going to see o .
place was very busy and service was terrible .
only bright side of the service was john the sommelier .
the whole night it felt like we were forgotten about was very disappointing .
do n't order a ny steak you will likely be disappointed .
service was awful .
i had baked stuffed shrimp .
sent back and came back hot but shrimp was over cooked .
the waiters never came back to check on us .
i ate _num_ of the _num_ .
i was very disappointed .
awful place .
after all the hype , clearly not worth it .
service was atrocious .
unfortunately , we were immediately disappointed by the behavior of our server .
the child had to eat crackers .
i am absolutely insulted .
we were a party of _num_ and one of our steaks was over cooked .
i have never been treated so poorly in such a beautiful restaurant .
confused , i ask `` is that for us ? ''
they just keep making us feel uncomfortable .
we felt rushed .
it 's not even like the restaurant was full !
but man , they could have handled that much better !
everyone had more than enough food , and left very satisfied .
i was totally embarrassed !
i made the painful trek with the help of my guest .
more embarrassment !
needless to say , my evening was ruined !
none of this should have happened .
after this glorious beginning it got worse .
assured me there would be no corkage charge .
there was a charge .
no problem , the sommelier paid for it .
no chef needed here , tails were great .
the waiter was ridiculously silly and lazy .
it still cost close to $ _num_ for a miserable dinner .
hugo 's cancelled my reservation after i had been there .
that is a problem that open table should fix in my view .
however , trip advisor is a much better place to review a restaurant .
well , it 's been _num_ days .
i get your message loud & clear , mr. assistant .
worst than the food was the terrible service .
i spent weeks deciding on where to eat to celebrate my cousin 's engagement .
nothing was seasoned at all so the meat itself tasted bland and dull .
i 'm angry just typing this out .
the ingredients were cheap and pathetic .
everyone hated their salad .
my steak was small and bland once again .
this was not done right .
oh and the fire alarm went off twice during our meal .
but not the best seafood we have had .
tuna was over cooked and had no flavor .
repeat guest with a disappointing experience on jan _num_ .
the only offer to make it right was a new salad or free desert .
neither is present anymore as the service was just ok .
no more hugo 's for us .
four ladies had dinner here on february _num_ .
i was embarrassed i had suggested hugo 's .
this was my fifth and final visit to hugo 's cellar .
- the veal marsala was a little chewy , with unremarkable taste .
- we waited a l o n g time for the check .
the great location and old-school vegas ambience are n't enough to carry this joint .
every other visit over the past 10+ years was at least four stars .
worse ?
it 's not that big a hassle but definitely a little weird .
but , if you 're looking for the vegas strip - go there instead .
fremont street ca n't really compare .
what a rip-off , man .
the experience got much worse on arrival to the hotel .
the gambling was fine , but the whole downtown experience sucked .
shell out a little extra money and get a place on the strip .
the _num_ queens was ok .
the place looked run down and old .
other than the two other things the _num_ queens was n't so bad .
this place seriously needs a renovation .
go back and spend your time in the golden nugget , next door .
another desk clerk said the same thing .
we got there and got stuck with a smoking room .
the hotel is n't fancy .
i was silly to think that everyone should experience this at least once .
possibly food poisoning , i do n't know for sure .
the room was ugly too .
im never staying or even gambling here again .
they gave me the room i wanted .
overall , the room was decent .
never heard a bell ring a jackpot .
i suggest you do n't gamble here and i wo n't go back .
_num_ bathroom : _num_ ( awesome shower pressure ! )
i was visiting as part of a college reunion .
the floor was still soggy as hell .
ugh .
i had to walk over this for another _num_ hours .
it sucked .
the hash browns tasted like they had just been fried next to some fish .
because the secret is they lower prices at the last minute .
i will not be back though .
just got that worn out old school sleazy feeling to it .
first , the receptionist at the desk was rude .
no pool .
the final negative came our last night there .
even the cocktail waitresses all seemed bored & put out to be there .
we had to sit at a slot machine to watch the game .
so to go downtown and off the strip was going to be an adventure .
strike _num_ - asked for non smoking connecting rooms .
however , i will not recommend them to anyone until i go again myself .
the blankets were worn and filled with cigarette burn holes .
fremont st experience or not .
even those _num_ table casinos in north las vegas have better rules than that !
and the ones that are not rude can not speak a word of english .
they do n't even hide the fact that they want you to lose .
it 's like eating cardboard .
she was a horrible liar !
he never smiles and just ruins my whole experience .
ahh _num_ queens .
nope ; no such luck .
two of the three lamps in the room did not work .
the air conditioner was very , very loud .
it got worse !
absolutely the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
one bathroom visit was enough for me .
apparently winners are not allowed here .
gross .
do they not clean the bathroom ?
also , the tissue box was disgusting .
lots of older people so young people would do better on the strip .
not a ton of activities or sites and far away from the strip .
no `` clubs '' just bars in casinos .
really noisy .
this is not the place to stay !
that was so low class it was just the last straw .
in summary , do n't stay there .
so we said , which is it $ _num_ or $ _num_ ?
the parking attendant then pockets the remaining $ _num_ .
this is not the way to run your parking structure four queens !
you have been warned .
old and old , o ya old .
did n't make sense .
would hate to see the older rooms .
oh my god , really ?
and why ca n't the attendant just take your word for it ?
stupid , just stupid .
they probably save money by hiring people that just got out of prison .
no no no no .
run for the hills .
there was no a/c in my room .
nothing really at the _num_ queens that gets me going here .
fairly loose slots based on people i know .
but will stop by because i tend to use them for their parking .
not a cocktail waitress in sight .
ok ... i do n't need a drink to gamble .
was n't really a fan of the gaming floor nor how clean it was .
the room that i stayed in had a fan , but no air conditioning .
on the plus side it was very cheep .
do n't go there if you want comps .
played there for _num_ days shooting craps and sports betting .
when i was checking out my points was only _num_ .
had to call and request it ourselves hours later ) .
we will take our business elsewhere for future visits if this is not resolved .
no offer of refund .
no offer of any form of compensation for the trouble .
therefore no future business .
service kinda sucks here and the works are kinda rude .
probably not going back here .
very very bad .
i was a repeat customer but will no longer be coming back .
the room was dirty i just gave up .
it was clearly not cleaned .
pee , and curly black hairs all .
it was truly disgusting .
north tower a bit run down .
needs updates asap .
will not stay here again till repairs are made .
would never stay here again .
the pool was such a disappointment !
ugh .
what an amazingly horrible experience .
spent _num_ nights there this week .
the north tour is so loud .
the registration desk fails to share this with you when you check in .
he gave me a parking pass and said i didnt need the white one .
turns out i did need that ticket and it caused me to be late .
needless to say , i probably wont stay here again .
complete waste of time and $ $ .
i went for breakfast for steak and eggs and was very disappointed .
the bathrooms are kinda gross .
i 'd rather stay at the cal or main street though .
just very disappointing .
new view sucked worse but we had a bigger bed .
all other hotels in the downtown area were much better at liquor service .
typical fremont old casino .
bad air ventilation ( smoky ! )
and kinda depressing .
_num_ stars because there are worse casinos in vegas .
rooms are not terrible but borderline gross .
everything was a little dirty with some kind of stain .
old rooms , smells like smoke everywhere and very loud .
i would n't stay at this hotel , even for free .
i was really upset and filed a report .
unfortunately , once it 's lost , it 's gone forever .
no , i do n't know .
i 'm never staying at the hotel again !
who made some bs excuse about why they could n't do it .
completely ruined the surprise but i made sure it did n't ruin the trip .
the four queens will never again get my time or money .
plus the place was dirty and dingy .
i 'm glad i did n't stay at their ugly rude staffed casino .
i would never stay here again .
it 's too old and not clean enough as a hotel should be .
very disappointed .
however the last couple of time the service has been awful .
the casino is super dirty and smells horrible .
the bathroom was absolutely disgusting tonight .
place has gone super downhill .
i tried to give it one more shot for ol time sake tonight .
the waitress was very put out to bring it to me .
i did talk to management and they told me too bad .
i would n't have been so upset if the lady was n't so rude .
she would n't even go away when i asked her to .
now after dinner again i 'm super sick and up in my hotel room .
so sad .
do n't stay !
by far the worst experience my boyfriend and i have ever had on vacation !
checked into our room on time and our room was n't even ready .
service was horrible !
never going back !
i stayed here for _num_ days august _num_ , _num_ .
we got to check in _num_ hours early .
it smelled like mildew and forget walking around without tennis shoes .
i seriously tried _num_ floors before one took my dollar and ate it .
not enough outlets in the room .
beds were very comfortable , blanket was soft , and the ac was epic .
i hate this place .
are you kidding me ?
so i stayed here for one night this past weekend .
then , i checked in .
obviously we had been put into the wrong room .
put our bags down , that was all good .
our room had been cleaned by that time .
no sign of bed bugs .
waited for _num_ minutes at a random machine .
but oh wait i have no more cash .
and they do n't take credit cards .
super pissed i will never spend a penny here again .
our waitress was not friendly at all !
the water server stated that it did not look tasty .
being black , i just paid and left to never go to four queens !
two weeks ago , my fiance met his family members at the four queens .
she stated that they needed to see $ _num_ in the machine .
they will never get another penny from me .
once again , i do n't appreciated being treated like a dirt bag .
sad ... .
as we were in the room we noticed it was n't very clean .
i would n't recommend staying here at all .
very horrible unfriendly staff .
luckily , i only slept for about _num_ hours and got out of there .
i would not recommend this hotel .
well obviously that is not good enough !
needless to say after this experience i would never ever go back !
i have an idea adjust the thermostat in your room !
how the heck can we sleep with the music so loud !
a major disappointment , my first time to vegas .
big mistake , loud ass rock most of the night .
toilet ran all night .
write this review .
this place was an epic disappointment !
the electrical outlet was brown and grey with dust & dirt .
we walked out of the elevators and noticed the ceiling decor was missing .
i immediately went to open the window and it was covered in dirt .
the bathroom floor was broken and dirt was left behind .
the bathroom looked as if someone threw brown food or drink all over .
the door handle to get out had some dripping white stuff dried all over .
_num_ stars .
basic room , seriously no frills .
but the room was cheap and at least clean .
what the hell is that about ?
the casino was cold for us .
nothing hit between roulette , black jack , or slots .
all around bad .
there was also bad mold in the bathroom .
i would never book this again .
it really is a shame my favorite valley restaurant is in this casino .
this , is the only reason i even gave it two stars .
we booked here due to the no resort fee .
the floor smelled very bad .
i know this is an establishment but really ?
horrible stay .
the room smelled like a high gym with cigarettes .
no other accommodations as it was done thru priceline .
worst customer service .
let 's see if i get my refund in _num_ days lol .
woke up the next day looking like crap .
the lady at the front counter was very rude to us .
we left our bags with them and walked around vegas until _num_ .
he ended up calling the hotel and was with them for about _num_ minutes .
i wish i could give a negative star .
disgusting .
hate this place !
# _num_ ... it 's not free !
horrible customer service , everyone has been short spoken and rude .
musty and dark !
if i were you , i would n't stay here .
if you do n't mind getting bit by bed bugs , then go ahead .
the quality of service is next to nothing now .
spoke to the cleaning ladies and they said security had done nothing about it .
sorry to say this will probably be my last stay .
it should be a crime to consider this a _num_ star hotel .
you couldnt pay me to even step foot in this dump again .
one star is too generous .
wanting to play roulette i went to the table .
when i tried to walk away he yelled again .
the pit boss did n't care when my dad explained the behavior .
i just checked in with my family a few hours ago .
i 'm disappointed .
nevertheless they are n't ours .
a bad first impression .
this hotel seems to be bad luck for me .
horrible service .
would give it negative stars if possible .
did not tell us they were remodeling and would not give us ice .
the customer service was horrible at check in .
i was freaking out cuz i couldnt see and i told them this .
but they didnt care .
its so sad .
really great = no hotel fees !
honestly could n't sit at the table long ... and still breathe .
the hotel upgraded us to their deluxe room free of charge .
no good view .
no , i would not .
otherwise , disappointment is guaranteed .
i stayed here over christmas and wanted to stay on fremont st .
however , there is no resort fee and is right on fremont st .
everything in this hotels needs to be remodeled .
we stayed _num_ nights and then headed to the strip .
the absolute worst hotel i have ever stayed at !
the staff is so rude , and dense !
we were told no , not at all .
it 's _num_ dollars a person .
we just paid _num_ bucks for a cab .
no fridge .
bathtub was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen .
first night , going to sleep , you hear freemont , loud and clear .
just be advised , it 's not quiet .
for _num_ dollars , you get _num_ minutes .
charges you _num_ minutes to print .
the bed was higher than our regular room .
why would n't you put a high bed in a handicapped room , right ?
they go to check out , and nobody knows where the car was .
um , why ?
certainly was n't us .
apparently you are a big inconvenience to them , and are wasting their time .
only _num_ employees we encountered were somewhat friendly .
they deserve a gold star .
horrible experience all around .
this was by far my worst experience at a las vegas hotel .
bad idea .
it is very , very poorly maintained and worn out .
we sat at the roulette table for a good hour with no cocktail waitress .
the sign clearly read _num_ minutes .
after words with the a manager , it was a total of _num_ minutes .
it appeared that the pizzas were already done , when they were n't .
worst hotel i have ever stayed .
music is loud in the evening , will not stop until midnight .
not a place to rest and relax .
if you stay here , do n't stay in the north tower .
worse place ever !
the room keys did n't work properly .
for the cost we could have stayed at the cortez for _num_ a night !
-the second time : when i returned around 11:30 pm .
unfortunately , the receptionist did not even bother explaining .
however , the key did not work .
and i used the fixed line in the hallway to reach the receptionist .
what a terrible hotel !
the hotel and casino is very , very outdated .
my room was pretty stuffy and had a funky smell .
the hotel room was pretty dirty .
the shower did n't drain .
the maids started work around 9am every morning and were insanely loud .
when we got to our room , the keys did not work .
room was just ok , beds are not very comfortable .
i will not be coming back or recommending this place .
but the room is disgusting and not worth it .
wish i could give zero stars .
just plain ghetto and trashy .
the smell of cigarettes is every where .
come on , second hand smoking ?
i would n't book again .
finally get our room key and get to our room .
clean room with decent beds but my god the room smelt of death !
this place is a rip off .
it 's smokey , locals abound , and there are some characters .
yes the 5th ave pub it is a true dive bar no questions asked .
his reply was it happens all the time and been going on for years .
weird atmosphere , very smoky , even dirty looking .
i have n't stayed here , nor do i recommend you do .
sad clientele at this place .
the el cortez is not for the faint of heart !
i 'm gon na tell you exactly what i think about this place .
this is the only reason i like this place .
that did n't keep me down though .
the whole place reeked of cigarette smoke .
i just personally do n't care to go back to it .
especially at 2am .
the crab was awful !
obviously frozen , definitely not worth the price .
such a shame .
yea but will i gamble there hell no !
our room looked very old and the bathroom especially looked extremely outdated .
beds were n't that comfortable .
i started off my evening by playing $ _num_ a hand black jack .
it was near impossible to get a pit boss to recognize me .
you will not be appreciated and treated with the proper respect .
it 's outside to get to your room and in _num_ degrees that stinks .
i would not recommend this hotel ... ever !
very unpleasant desk person .
this place is nasty !
the smell is so strange and not good !
room is ugly & the bed was extremely uncomfortable .
they never return your deposit .
they stole my money .
turns out in the end i did not pay a cheap price .
i stayed in a queen tower suite .
the room is spacious and had all of the amenities that you need .
everything is old , yet cheap here .
they are located above the casino , accessible only by a flight of stairs .
i would not recommend these rooms at all !
took forever and a half to check-in .
but not cheap enough to attract me back .
it 's just not enough , yet .
i am really angry at this place .
do not get drawn in by the super cheap rates !
my friend and i just went inside to buy drinks .
he seemed a bit slow .
he did n't even know how to pour our drinks right .
what a waste .
the guy sucked at pouring .
who the hell hired this guy ?
major disappointment .
there was some karaoke going on .
some of the people were good , others sucked .
there was some alcohol promotion going on too .
sucked to be them !
wifi is not free ( $ _num_ ) at all as advertised .
it is really frustrating and i will never stay here again .
absolutely dreadful dirty rooms .
staff was friendly and courteous though .
now they are just out of the way and expensive .
management here is more concerned with policy than guest loyalty .
however my wife woke up with three bed bug bites on her leg !
my experience at el cortez hotel was awful !
at this point i was highly irritated !
no one from hotel management bothered to check on us .
the staff rarely cleaned our `` upgraded '' room .
they are not getting away with this !
negative zero times _num_ to el cortez hotel .
my husband likes blackjack and they still have some $ _num_ tables .
they have _num_ or _num_ of these machines .
well , after last night i will never go there again .
i do n't get it .
and , they wo n't get any of my money again .
do n't waste your time at this place .
rude .
stupid .
you know , for the price , this is n't a dump .
if you 're looking for something cheap and acceptable , this is it .
okay , no resort fees .
so on check-in , i asked what the final rate would be .
then upon checkout , they charge a $ _num_ resort fee for two nights .
that brought the total for two nights up to $ _num_ .
there were some small problems .
but i kind of expected it for the price we paid .
none of that even bothered me .
i 've never had trouble with the battery just giving out for no reason .
the costumer service of this place is appalling .
i 've been here a million times and he is never cordial .
but they have lost me as a customer ... at least for gaming .
they now charge a $ _num_ resort fee ... some resort , wtf .
the included wifi was the sole reason i chose el cortez .
no poker room .
vintage rooms are above the casino and stairs only , no elevator .
this place is a dump and i am not a picky person at all .
tried to upgrade to a suite but every room was booked .
the room itself was okay , and seemed to be clean .
you can never really tell with hotel rooms though .
after we had gotten drunk , this became even more difficult .
it was such and uncomfortable experience !
we decided to just pack our bags and go stay with family .
it is a run down casino with old furniture inside the rooms .
would n't dare to walk by myself on those streets .
do n't recommend at all .
horrible place they 're thieves !
this review is solely based off of the rude security employee i encountered .
he was completely rude .
the service in this hotel was beyond bad .
i will not stay there again .
the hotel s terrible .
the shower was broken , the sink was dirty .
it was a terrible experience .
more over the also charge additional $ _num_ for regular amenities .
the worst casino experience ever !
and no free points for new membership at their casino .
worst hotel ever ... .
$ _num_ water in your room .
and its not for the whole damn weekend it per damn night .
my wife and i visited las vegas over memorial day weekend .
as much gambling as we do , we do not believe in resort fees .
if not , then we probably wo n't .
not that bad you say ?
you cant even visit other hotel guests in any other room !
my friend in the floor above me ca n't visit me .
they also had this card system to operate the elevators .
some of the electrical did n't work .
not that big of a deal .
looked in the bathroom to find a wet towel on the tub floor .
they left a really bad impression .
overall , it sucks to pay $ _num_ and be made to feel unwelcome .
but unfortunately i 'm forced to give it _num_ .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the shower head was cracked and sprayed water everywhere .
they offered bottled water with the room for $ _num_ piece .
get it together el cortez !
regardless of how terrible the room actually was .
worst hotel ever .
valet is completely rude .
to have guest in the room it 's $ _num_ a night per person .
this was one of the most ridiculous things i 've ever heard of .
to top it all off the room was well below average .
never staying at this place again .
rooms were relatively clean but smelled like horse crap .
sorry , i was n't born yesterday .
worst place i have ever stayed at .
rooms are not worth the price ( gross rooms ) .
staff does not seem to know policies .
security and staff are extremely rude .
nothing here worth a second look .
do n't bother going .
if i could give less that one star i would .
the staff was extremely rude .
casino is rather small compared to other casinos in the luxurious downtown area .
i could not get past the smell in the casino .
yeah after _num_ mins in this hole i left .
horrible place !
i cant give this place less than _num_ .
left a cash tip .
i can leave a nasty review .
the `` free '' parking advertised on the parking structure is not actually free .
this hotel is disgusting .
my negative experience began with that and the hits just kept on coming .
they quoted me $ _num_ extra per night .
stayed with my king tower room .
arrived at the hotel , it smelled horrible .
so i quickly got my key and went up to my room .
room _num_ to be exact .
are you guys stupid ?
do you not realize that you work in a service industry ?
very rude and not very helpful .
no matter what shift .
terrible service .
it 's ridiculous .
it 's was so ridiculous .
bottom line , it just is n't fun to play here ... period .
so they would n't let me bet .
not even a smaller amount ( i offered to bet just $ _num_ ) .
at this point it was becoming ridiculous .
plus the guy is throwing away my future business by being rude to me .
i mean , you have to be kidding me at this point .
have a bad day much ?
just laughable .
even though they are closer to my home , why would i return ?
so false advertising on all adds .
all of the hipster crap around el cortez .
killed what i loved about el cortez _num_ yrs ago .
not anymore , instead you have hipster trash so called art .
the culture of fremont that once was is gone .
absolute worst experience of my life !
thanks but no thanks .
service is awful and the hotel is extremely depressing .
never ever to be back to this hell hole .
i wish i could leave a zero star feedback .
seems like most patrons are homeless and/or ghetto and rude beyond belief .
we stayed in room _num_ .
it was quite possibly the worst room i 've ever stayed in .
also , the sliding shower door was probably from the early _num_ 's .
bed bugs !
i would give this hotel _num_ stars if i could .
trust me , it is not worth it !
stay from hell and hands down worse hotel ever .
it 's unfortunate that the bartender is such as asshole .
the only thing that was decent in the room was the beds and tv .
stayed here a while back because it was cheap !
also , everyone at the hotel was so rude .
the hotel is very old and could use a major upgrade all around .
the elevator broke due to lack of proper maintenance .
they obviously do not care about their clientele only taking your money .
do not stay at el cortez !
there are tons of other hotels why go somewhere where you are not appreciated .
the beds were lumpy - lumpy !
fail . )
smoky , bad wifi internet connection .
rooms are run down , but not real bad .
had a reservation for _num_ nights - left _num_ night early .
i tried to connect to it and it failed .
that room should have been like _num_ dollars a night max .
is not as strong as before but it 's still there .
with all these improvements and the only entertainment is a piano player ?
also the waitresses should get new outfits .
the cabana suites are starting to get a little dirty .
i 'm so frustrated and disappointed with this hotel .
she offered no solutions .
she was like we do n't have room service anymore .
i 'm appalled at the service or lack there of .
i can not wait to go home .
bed is the most uncomfortable bed ever .
would n't stay here again even if it was free .
the room was hot .
prepared to wait there while you flush .
when gambling also be prepared to have no one ask if you want drinks .
saturday nights are the worst .
we waited almost _num_ hours and no one asked .
they seem to be extremely understaffed in that department .
old , dingy and not in the center of downtown vegas is this casino .
not me .
this place was horrible !
the service was horrible .
at this point we still did n't have our salads .
about _num_ minutes later he brings to salads to them and nothing for us .
still no salads .
after waiting a few more minutes our main entree arrives but still no salads .
it was old and dated and didnt look anything like the photos at all .
lady at the desk was rude .
over _num_ for one night in hell .
to put it simply , do n't stay here .
forget the `` best blackjack in la . ''
just go find someplace that does n't have mud in their beds .
our stay started off horrible from the get go .
service was n't good and room were less then .
you will most likely get a room that does not have elevator access .
this happened to me after booking on hotels.com .
she then wanted to charge me $ _num_ upgrade .
the room was fine albeit very dated .
overall it was ok once i was able to figure out the room situation .
you could not even valet park .
this was a very disappointing experience .
i ca n't believe what has become of this place .
bad experience from the moment we arrived .
we finally get our key and head over to our suite .
the room was tiny and uncomfortable .
the room was dirty and had the worst lighting .
the cabana suites are more expensive then the regular rooms .
this has not been my experience at any other casino , ever .
i am sad to say that is probably our last time staying there .
take your money elsewhere .
not safe !
room was ok , bed was hard and uncomfortable .
this place is not safe , and i doubt security cares at all .
wrong !
wrong !
no one ahead of us and no one behind us .
wrong again .
he then says , ok _num_ dollars for deposit and _num_ for resort fee .
this is just poor poor absolute horrible customer service .
ill also be writing to corporate .
horrible customer service and dumb rules .
she was yelling from the beginning without any word from our mouths .
i wish i could give negative stars .
at el cortez , i quickly noticed the property had seen better days .
do n't be fooled by the _num_ star hotel rating .
this place is far from mediocre .
it does n't even deserve a single point from a single star .
unless you have reached rock bottom , stay the hell away .
this place is hopefully not for you .
the cocktail servers are zombie like .
they lose , not me !
too bad for this place because i like old vintage vegas casinos .
guess that 's why there was hardly anyone in there on friday night .
the soup was ok , but the sandwich sucked and so did the fries .
if only you can get the ribs without anything else .
avoid this place unless you have no choice .
i wish i checked yelp first .
it was the first steak ever that i did not finish .
people at next table had the same problem .
i am not going to eat there again .
not for me .
the only thing i liked on my plate was the baked potato .
only real plus ; the service from our waitress was great .
went on a friday night and was able too get in without a wait .
i ordered the st. louis ribs full slab with fries .
it is a restaurant chain located inside a casino in downtown las vegas .
the wait staff was attentive and accommodating .
only eat ribs here .
anything else you will be very disappointed .
the only good point is ... its cheap .
glad i did n't pay for my meal here .
very pink in the middle , definitely not cooked enough to my liking .
she seriously was running around like a chicken with her head cut off .
the fries were not hot , and neither was my burger .
this place is seriously a tourist trap for sure .
if you order a steak you can get a lobster tail for $ _num_ .
the steak was n't quite that bad , but it was bad .
it was tough and dry and yucky , yes , yucky .
the baked potato was actually pretty good and i ate all of it .
our server was older and so so so rude .
you had a group of _num_ , and we were mellow and low key .
my pulled pork sandwich was soooo dry .
i had hoped for more .
if it sounds too good too be true , it probably is .
the $ _num_ steak and lobster was terrible .
the potato was , well , a potato .
baked potato and baked beans were good , fries were standard .
staff were just short of rude .
oh , heaven 's no .
so why did i go here ?
but i guess you get for what you pay !
so do n't waste your money on the special !
tony roma 's does n't get it !
the onion loaf was the only good part of the meal .
_num_ for prime rib and lobster ?
it was a _num_ minute wait until we got to try this place .
the lobster had no taste .
i guess it 's true , you get what you pay for .
this place was a definite no and i dont recommend this place .
gf and i visited in the fall of _num_ .
meat quality is definitely low grade .
avoid at all costs , even though they appear to be low .
you get what you pay for , which is n't much to be honest .
the host told us _num_ minutes even though half the restaurant was empty .
asked for recommendations for drink selections , he was n't very helpful .
food came out quickly but again , you get what you pay for .
i could barely taste the burger .
also i asked for no tomatoes and got tomatoes .
fries were standard , nothing special .
when we were done we had to wait almost _num_ minutes for our check .
if i could have given it `` _num_ '' stars i would have .
we spoke to the bartender about it and he just did n't care .
not , it still took at least _num_ _num_ mins to get it .
it is horrible !
if there was an option to give negative stars i would .
this was easily the worst dining experience i have ever had .
we sat for about _num_ minutes before we were able to order drinks .
another _num_ minutes rolled by and we still did n't have service .
strike _num_ .
completely out of water she never attempted to refill .
my fries were actually as cold as the ranch .
the steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat .
i live downtown , and go here every week or two for takeout .
virtually no one in the place but was totally ignored by the bartenders .
my wife always gets the same thing ... potato skins and mozzarella sticks .
ribs are over priced and taste horrid .
i mean , how do you screw up fries !
the food was horrible .
the steak had no flavor and was dry .
worst food , worst service .
i created this yelp account just because of this bad experience .
we ordered the $ _num_ steak and lobster specials .
our lobster tails smelled foul , so we did not eat them .
this is a ridiculous place with ridiculous service .
in my opinion , this place needs to be shut down .
this was the worst dinner ever !
my margarita was little more than flavored water .
restaurant is not open in the mornings or lunch .
the meal also came with baked or mashed potatoes .
i think bread was served also before the meal , i ca n't remember .
disappointed .
just sad .
too busy .
too few servers .
$ _num_ of dog food i guess .
horrible service .
did n't hear them call a number for _num_ mins .
then went back and were told out number was called then past .
we ended up taking another number # _num_ and waiting another 30-45 mins .
go check out my photo of the bucket of empty promises .
however this place was packed ... .
seriously , this place was truly awful .
but this time , i felt compelled to spread the word and warn others .
the buffet in the fremont hotel and casino is much better .
the food was awful .
the service was just as bad .
waste of money .
a _num_ min wait for a place that did not have a full restaurant .
we places our order and the waiter even repeated that back to us .
that was returned to get the same thing .
mistake # _num_ ?
do yourself a favor and do not eat here .
the waiter then asks how every thing is .
wrong question .
these was the worst meal out in a long long long time .
... do not spend your money or time in this place .
their business page on yelp said they close at _num_ pm .
umm wtf kind of crap is that ?
so many things wrong with that answer .
you close at _num_ , not _num_ !
why not sit us there ?
way to be accommodating to paying customers .
unfortunately , we were seated .
one of the worst places i have eaten at .
the hamburger meat looked like was _num_ weeks old .
$ _num_ steak and lobster caught our attention ... big mistake !
a fair warning , do not eat this tony roma 's .
disgusting !
no no .
when we checked in we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait .
terrible experience !
got cole slaw and a baked potato .
baked potato and cole slaw was fair .
it was dry .
in summary , tony roma 's is a below average overpriced restaurant .
do n't waste your time .
but the meat quality is below average .
service is also not up to standard .
can not recommend this place .
this dining experience was horrible !
our server was rude and she clearly is in the wrong job .
ribs were served barely luke warm , tender but flavorless .
microwaved fake `` baked '' potatoes that were undercooked .
avoid this place like the plague .
the food and service just is n't there anymore .
simply do not eat here .
i ordered the ribeye for $ _num_ .
i mean had it been a little pink , i would have ate it .
i opted for nothing , hands down would not pay for anything here .
my wife had a filet which was tough as a sirloin .
so i win but never again will i set foot in this joint .
the vegetables was old looking and tasted like it was freezer burned .
the steak dinner was overpriced and just nasty .
not comfortable seating at all !
i was terribly disappointed .
the salad was very disappointing , and the ribs were worse .
it is a dump in a dumpy place .
food was ok if your expectations are set by the cheap prices .
if you expect food good you will be disappointed .
ate at this place for christmas dinner and it was a horrible experience !
it was terrible and food was n't even that great .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
instead i gave it _num_ star .
it was so loud you could barely hear anyone talk .
the only thing good from our experience were the alcoholic drinks .
such a disappointing experience for such a big name place .
apparently the management could care less about that .
i do n't know where to start about this place .
the food was stale and hard to chew and small portions .
overall not good .
yea we may come back if we drunk enough .
btw i 'm a local server for over _num_ years ... .
i was ripped off .
it hurt me ... its on my mind .
30th .
was horrible .
in downtown las vegas ever again .
up to true tony roma 's standards .
service was horrible !
food was horrible .
steak was completely flavorless .
lobster tail left something to be desired !
do not recommend this to anyone , i would rather eat mcdonald 's !
very crowded , standard corporate tasting meals .
anyway , this is not a `` local stand out '' restaurant .
attracts visitors more than anything is my guess .
still the food was n't bad , just not great .
the fried onion - does n't hold a candle to outback - bland !
if only there was a zero star rating !
i think it has gotten worse .
the baked potato tasted burnt .
i ordered the sirloin steak ; garlic mashed ; and corn on the cob .
the steak was not very tender or tasty .
wo n't go back here again .
place was pretty busy .
unfortunately , i will never come to tony roma 's again .
felt completely rushed .
the waiter had no interest in serving us and probably just wanted my money .
left him $ _num_ tip .
yep , no joke .
umm , i can make myself a better steak dinner at home .
such a waste of $ _num_ .
no prime rib tonight . ''
are they kidding me ?
what a surprise , they do not carry the garlic butter .
they do n't even serve bread unless you request it .
it tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water i ever drank .
i got the sirloin ... and it was horrible .
do n't eat here if your looking for a decent steak .
even at _num_ for steak and lobster , it was n't worth it .
surly waitress until she brought the bill and smiled for tip .
the people who ordered off the menu did n't seem to do much better .
this place is horrible !
this is the worst tony roma 's i have ever visited !
it was overcooked and dry !
worse quality of food i 've ever eaten .
long story short .
he was cleaning the table next to us with gloves on and a rag .
gross .
the sign says tony roma 's but this place is a fraud .
it 's a shame the one in henderson closed .
very poor quality service and food .
so sketchy !
that freaked me out that they are just holding all that food !
wo n't be back .
i ca n't give this restaurant more than two stars .
great waitress , but the food was below standard for its price .
ordered half bbq chicken , tons of gristle , not much meat on it .
very annoying .
we were wrong .
the lobster tail looked dry and had an awful appearance and texture .
the mixed vegetables appeared to be out of a can .
even though the price is low , the special is totally not worth it .
the food was just not worth the money .
the kind and blonde bus woman was more attentive than our waitress .
we were seated within _num_ minutes , but that 's the only good part .
it was horrible .
it was so tough that it was hard to eat .
we will not be going back .
food quality was very poor .
steak was over done and steamed fish was under cooked .
i will not recommend `` second street grill '' to anyone .
so i said ok let me go ahead and order this .
it 's a chicken caesar salad not a side salad .
i had to get kinda rude and tell her just leave it .
it was the worst steak and lobster i have ever had .
talk about going downhill .
unbelievable failure on customer service !
rude , negative management with incompetent people skills !
he said they will not be taking the party .
she clearly could have cared less about our business .
they deserve no stars !
so i ordered , and low and behold .
i will not be returning , sorry !
quick stop into the cafe for a quick bite around _num_ am .
i had the nachos , he had the breakfast special .
nothing special about either of these .
stale chips , cold cheese .
cold bacon , cold toast .
terrible experience .
guess my friends will listen to me next time !
skip this place ... unless of course you like cold food and slow service .
i think we had _num_ different servers helping us which confused my party .
that night i had a burger with cheddar cheese which was okay at best .
the meal took _num_ minutes to arrive , sans oj .
wrong !
if so , that would be sad .
i would never go back .
another terrible place to avoid in golden nugget is the chart house .
kind of annoying .
as for the food , it was meh .
my boyfriend had a bbq burger and he said it was just ok .
i have never done this , but this place was deserving .
no late night specials .
was n't impressed .
the fettuccine was over cooked and the sauce was under seasoned .
and that is not an exaggeration , i timed it .
i ordered a virgin bloody mary and eggs benedict ( my favorite breakfast ) .
the food was n't quite that bad , but definitely not good .
only thing worse than the food was the service , worst waitress ever !
also tasted the american club sandwich .
too salty as well .
the only thing passable was the fries .
not great , not terrible .
how the mighty have fallen .
this was once the reliable place that one would visit in old downtown .
the nugget is the vegas capitol of zombie employees .
my cc is from my bank and looks just like a check card .
i 've stayed at _num_ star joints and never had so much trouble .
however , the bread pudding was pretty good there .
so we wait .
the general area seemed pretty run down , and the sun was setting .
so i land in vegas , grab my rental and head to the hotel .
it was n't a holiday , just a friday .
another _num_ minutes of walking later i finally get to my room .
thankfully , they let me stay in there this time .
i did n't get an upgraded room or anything , same deal .
a big mistake .
maybe the points system is really that bad ?
i did n't even bother asking at that point .
this casino really sucks .
this place sucks .
however , on my last visit , i had a horrible time .
it was not an ordinary roach .
horrible place to stay .
the dealers were a bunch of sarcastic wise guys and the place was dead .
let me preface this with the fact that i hate vegas .
the rooms themselves were ok , like holiday inn ok .
so disappointed !
stains on the carpet , a mouse in the hall .
overall the whole place felt dated , tacky , and depressing .
not what i was hoping for !
they did replace it with much better lettuce but it was still just blah .
overall , i probably wo n't be staying there again !
the upgrades they claim to have are not true .
i hate this place .
do n't stay here .
they offered to bring up a fold away bed and we agreed .
fault also lies with the hotel .
just remember the money you bring to vegas stays in vegas .
the room was just like any _num_ or _num_ three star hotel .
but i just think that they have some room for improvement .
not so cool .
i spent most of my time gambling in the neighboring ones .
* valet is super slow and it was _num_ degree out there .
but do n't expect it to be nice , the double tree is nicer .
i will not stay here again , not even when i 'm old .
on the strip ) .
the front desk and parking attendants were very nice .
everybody else sucked !
the pool had a shark tank and slide ... it was just ok nice .
but back to the pool story : it was not worth it .
the pool was really small and there were small children everywhere !
lame .
golden nugget on the night of september _num_ , _num_ .
it 's dirty , smelly , and about as trashy as you can imagine .
i am no longer staying with this hotel ... way to go !
serious drag .
also - and more important ; the bathroom was not clean .
the day of the $ _num_ breakfast is over .
ugh .
downtown las vegas is gross and filthy as it is .
but golden nugget to me is not worth the expense .
the staff was unfriendly and not very helpful .
that was my 1st time staying at the golden nugget and mostly my last .
this just looks so ghetto .
i should n't have to deal with stuff while on vacation .
so much noise .
i arrived just before _num_ , with an friends dinner to attend .
they went on to say that we should have booked using the guarantee upgrade .
for $ _num_ more they would guarantee we would have a non-smoking room .
needless to say we will not be coming back to stay at golden nugget .
i was very disappointed with the staff on this last trip however .
she gave me a hard time about it and asked me again .
i am not one to rant and rave about issues .
i am so disappointed in the service i received .
very disappointed .
i did n't stay at the hotel , only went to the buffet .
i emailed them with a copy of my yelp !
* i called the front desk to ask for pick-up service for dry cleaning .
* do n't try to take the towels out of the pool area .
* like some third world country , wireless is not considered a basic service .
besides poor customer service , the place really is n't that bad .
the nugget has a lot of problems .
i always leave them a giant tip .
you can bet $ _num_ a hand for _num_ hours and you get nothing !
you get nothing unless you are a guest in the hotel !
this place was horrible .
the room had _num_ beds however it was not quite a twin or full .
the pool was not all that great either .
they need to clean the tank so u can see the fish better .
you may not have room access !
and do not pay $ _num_ vip access !
we just waited almost _num_ hours to get into our room .
blackjack dealers were not very friendly .
steve wynn 's legacy of quality service is long dead .
ugh .
service seems to really be going downhill at this place , which is sad .
i think next visit i save money and stay at main street instead .
worst hotel stay in my life !
well , that plan did n't go so well .
this was unacceptable !
`` sir would you like me to move you to another room ?
what a jack hole !
i will never return to this dump !
and i would not recommend this place to anyone who comes to las vegas !
i have no idea how this hotel has anything above a _num_ star review .
no fridge , no complimentary coffee , no wi-fi ... .
not good .
it really felt like a depressing holiday inn .
we were staying in the gold tower .
rush tower seemed nicer .
wo n't be back to find out .
it knocked us out for the rest of the night .
you are better off staying at the worst hotel on the strip than here .
are you kidding me ?
the only thing that is **** at golden nugget are the prices .
food trash in the halls .
the only reason to stay here is someone else picked up the room tab .
downtown is trashy , noisy , dirty .
_num_ nights in april .
water is $ _num_ .
the golden nugget is an older hotel/casino on the fremont street area in vegas .
pretty lame , in this day and age .
the alarm clock was way too complicated , never did figure that thing out .
we then waited _num_ minutes in line to check in .
why they had the closet in the bathroom i still could n't figure out .
then when you opened the closet doors they would n't stay open .
what the hell !
this is almost $ _num_ more than what i originally wanted to spend .
so disappointing .
now i have to wait 1-2 weeks to get my $ _num_ deposit back .
not even a smile did we get .
then after walking all the way to our tower the keys do n't work !
all i want is to get into my room !
they gave us the wrong room .
room service was bad and overpriced .
there were dirty towels in our bathroom .
they charge ten dollars to make coffee in your room .
the clientele was trashy .
this place sucked .
stayed off the strip and paid for it , through the nose !
service is horrible , and food is inedible .
tried to stay off the strip and paid in more ways than one .
will never make that mistake again !
with our email confirmation we got everything fixed and went to our room .
we returned to our room with new keys which of course did n't work .
_num_ minutes later we called the front desk from our cell .
spent ten minutes waiting for the manager .
wifi is _num_ ... .
crazy expensive and should be free .
would pick the fremont experience over the strip any day .
she only had it for _num_ month so far .
my girlfriend was a wreck , and could n't stop crying .
they could only give us a $ _num_ discount for the extra day .
casino only review : i 'm not really a fan of the golden nugget .
and each time i go in , i do n't have a good experience .
compared to other properties on fremont the golden nugget just feels off to me .
they do not i repeat do not guarantee a non-smoking room .
supposedly it , and i quote , `` depends on availability . ''
let 's just say i am not thrilled and will never be returning .
i give it _num_ stars because of all of the kids running around .
last time i checked vegas was an adult place .
well this place is horrible because its run down by kids everywhere !
i really have no complaints about my actual stay there .
it just does n't even make sense and is just bad business .
shame on you golden nugget .
i 've put a charge block on my card .
she then said , `` well , whoever booked this online booked two nights .
i simply replied , `` no . ''
i wish i could give this hotel no stars .
watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information .
the first time was when i originally booked my stay in july .
it 's not attached to my reservation .
it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me .
again , i would not recommend you give these people your credit card information .
also , shark tank swimming pool !
paid more and stayed at the rush tower .
not just a nice room in a mediocre hotel .
my email regarding the over charge has never been acknowledged .
stay off season and during the week and you wo n't feel ripped off .
the golden nugget is terrible !
customer service was the worst experience i have ever had at any hotel .
at night it was peaceful , quiet , and the way it should be .
i really did not enjoy our stay at this casino .
we went there on the day before new years .
i could go on how this is not a place to bring kids .
but it gets worse .
but getting us a new room was a very low priority .
i simply think the _num_ star rating of this hotel is a fraud .
it is less quality than circus circus and much more expensive .
during that time my jewelry box was stolen .
why would someone enter my room without cleaning it , changing the towels etc .
what a horrible experience !
stayed at the carson tower last week .
she was knocked down and her purse was stolen .
security should have been better !
not even a word of apology from the casino .
they told me no because that was hotel policy .
what was even worse was my talk with the manager , julio .
disappointed with food service at pool .
took _num_ hours and food was cold .
also very slow service at the grotto .
wait staff did n't check back .
also coffee in the room was $ _num_ for _num_ k cups !
now , the bad .
the rooms were absolutely nothing special .
the service is terrible in all the restaurants and bars in the place .
he was rude , more times than once .
negative _num_ stars !
i am so disgusted with this place .
unbelievable .
housekeeping : _num_ pm and when we got back to our room .
no , we 're here two more days !
is n't this a casino hotel where guests sleep in ?
does this seem fair ?
it 's not even check out time.
but the desserts , which look great , are awful .
the apple cobbler is way too sweet and like wallpaper paste .
the pool was foul .
danielle checked me in .
i 'm not impressed at all .
i 'm here for _num_ more days so i will write a follow up .
poor poor poor customer service .
not enough table games for anyone into those .
the only reason the hotel is getting _num_ stars is the pool .
will not return to this hotel .
- the pool , if you reserve space because it is slammed .
- rooms in the carson tower were clean , minus the odor .
- the odor in the room was funky .
we could n't figure it out until we smelled the towels and sheets .
it is a combination of musty and old laundry smell .
we were told that somebody was on there way _num_ different times .
probably not .
probably not too many .
you feel you need to be the first to put in a fee ?
why bother ?
whoever thought of this one should be canned .
smelly crab legs , and overall quality had gone downhill .
i arrive to this place , confused trying to figure out where to park .
me : `` no .
he then proceeds to the car behind me and does the same thing .
no biggie !
we stayed here last weekend and the staff was horribly rude !
where did they think they were taking our bags ?
rude staff including some managers .
the buffet restaurant is really nasty .
will not stay at this ever again .
still our hotel and casino of choice .
but there was a sewer gas smell in our room all weekend .
even after housekeeping tried to put something down the drain .
but if the smell has n't been taken care of .
i tried to valet my car and was told it was full .
they should have a parking spot for my car .
granted i stayed at the old tower but it seemed a little run down .
the room was very mediocre and had a weird smell .
however , the patrons there were not cool .
it just felt too over crowded and not fun .
also , we had a really bad experience with the elevator .
me and my man friend were the last people to get off the elevator .
i would never stay at this hotel again .
the worst customer service we 've ever experienced .
in room water : $ _num_ , in room coffee $ _num_ .
we were disappointed as we had planned to spend the day by the pool .
the uncaring and apathetic staff here are unbelievable !
there are no comment cards in rooms , i wonder why ?
like i sad , a dump , and an absolutely insulting experience .
i started yelling as my son did the same .
the other people that left the elevator saw what was happening .
i was not bothered medical help or even a free stay .
very poor service !
try the plaza or d. the casino itself was a total rip off .
there was no excitement in the atmosphere , and everyone just seemed pissed off .
not a good sign for the overall odds .
our reservation was for one night to celebrate my sister 's 21st birthday .
they told me i am not allowed to use it .
i was sadly disappointed .
i followed him back out to the valet area .
he then asked me to count my bags .
the pool was nice but crowded .
i wo n't stay again .
we made the mistake of staying here for my daughter 's 21st birthday .
wo n't be staying here again .
the room was clean , but nothing fancy .
absolutely , the worst i 've encountered in a hotel .
however , we were very disappointed .
they thankfully never checked us out of our 19th floor room .
this place does not deserve _num_ 1/2 stars !
first off , the double beds are not adequate for two people .
i will not be staying here again !
the casino itself is kind of gross .
outside is the old las vegas which also is n't all that fun .
worst part is the customer service .
it 's terrible .
they never put it back .
this hotel is terrible with even worse service .
management just gave us some lame excuse but no real help .
no refrigerator microwave .
and the room was not really clean .
would not stay here again .
yea ... no .
first time staying at this hotel , and likely my last .
why did i even call if it 's not noted somewhere ?
needless to say , i did not shower .
check-out , i tell the guy behind the counter .
why would i want to stay there again ?
what a nightmare .
what a disappointment .
we decided to eat at the buffet ... ... that was terrible .
the food quality was below standard and was highly over priced for a thursday .
more disappointment .
the room stayed a constant _num_ degrees .
front desk refused to change our room .
everytime i called the front desk the operator would cut me off mid sentence .
what a complete disappointment .
the only thing nice at this hotel is the pool .
take my advice stay somewhere else anywhere would be better .
never again screw this place and to he 'll with vegas .
however , the check-in time was horrendous !
this was the start of bad service the whole stay .
crappy service threw the whole hotel !
this is the most disgusting hotel i 've been to in my life .
no wonder i could n't find any photos of their suites .
i guess this is why people do n't stay in downtown las vegas .
what a disappointment .
the newer tower where we stayed was nice .
the buffet was pretty nasty , although the pasta man was super nice .
seems like everyone we talked to there hated their jobs and were therefore unprofessional .
the desk people generally sucked and were short with us .
that sucked .
the most horrible experience happened last night ... so here is my warning .
unfortunately this is a theme throughout the entire casino staff .
my bride and i recently stayed at and were married at the golden nugget .
the service was lacking from check-in .
this was unacceptable considering one of our guests was pregnant .
we stayed in the rush tower .
the room was ok , but extremely loud at night due to outside music .
more poor service ... at check in we received a coupon book .
following the ceremony , we went for a drink in the lobby .
i will be looking elsewhere next time we travel to vegas .
i was so disappointed on my recent visit .
first of all , the wait to check it was so long .
there was hardly anyone in line but there was only _num_ check-in counters .
second of all , the check-in girl was so rude .
the worst thing about this recent visit was parking .
there was no parking even for hotel guests .
even worse was the attitude we got from everyone .
i am so disappointed in the staff and service .
if it wasnt for the pool i might have burned to death .
i made the mistake of going on the 4th of july .
the sink did n't drain and neither did the bathtub !
the hotel was booked so we couldnt get moved .
i will not be staying there again unless it was free !
terrible service and total lack of hospitality .
if i 'm forced to stay downtown , i would stay here .
this is what i would call classic las vegas !
what the actual f ?
they are actually fake cameras .
only the casino cameras are working , no surprise .
the golden nugget did n't do anything about it , and shrugged it off .
a note was left to have us change rooms .
out , their slot machines do n't pay nothing , absolutely nothing .
you around , not even little something 's to keep you playing .
the sink in my gold tower room became completely backed up with sewage .
-i like that the elevators in carson and gold tower had no music playing .
cheap room .
we made our reservations _num_ month before our stay and paid for it .
well , they do not understand the meaning of reservation .
and they do n't take reservations .
month ahead of time .
take a smoking room .
our rooms smelled really bad .
i ca n't believe even a smoker could stand the smell .
this is vegas .
should be _num_ hrs .
room shower does n't work & no rooms left .
so far not looking good .
not worth _num_ star so far .
but no shower water !
i 'm tired & on dc time in vegas .
so my body clock is at 5am even though its 2am vegas !
i told front desk this but no maintenance ever came to fix it .
i 've stayed at golden nugget several times .
my experience is never consistent .
i had _num_ different bites all over my body and my friend had _num_ !
it is barely _num_ blocks from the golden nugget .
we have charges to our charge card that are n't ours .
customer service is lacking in some areas .
the golden nugget was the only business that did not treat us well .
currently staying here , they offer no shuttle service .
we will not stay at this hotel again .
casino is nice but the layout is so confusing .
checkin was so confusing .
the tower you book your room is where you checkin .
room was horrible .
not my idea of a nice hotel .
sure the lady said for $ _num_ a person .
most of the staff was not very friendly .
went to las vegas with a group , to visit a convention in town .
never saying they are only splitting the second night !
and if you hold more , rooms your stuck .
only way , i found out was _num_ charges for one stay !
then she tells me i 'm not the first one that said something .
who knows what else is not actually cleaned in this room .
i wo n't be back .
no call .
ok , i let that pass .
finally just left the room and cancelled that request .
and this is coming from an ex bartender and hospitality worker .
the room we stayed in had bed bugs .
my friend and i came from _num_ different states on _num_ different planes .
never once did richard from the risk dept .
at the very least they could have returned our $ from the stay .
avoid this place like the plague !
there are plenty of nicer places to stay in las vegas .
i went here as a staycation on new years of this year .
i was disappointed .
the room was run down .
there was a mini fridge which was nice .
no shit it should be free , they already messed up my original reservation .
after arriving to the king room , there was blood in the bathroom .
so wait , did they not clean it before ?
disappointing all around .
just to get down and out to fremont was a _num_ minute ordeal .
the hotel staff were not very welcoming or helpful .
however , we did not know this is not the policy at the nugget .
all in all , i would n't recommend anyone to stay here .
if i want to go i will just pay to get in .
the service over my stays have always been inconsistent .
so sorry we went back !
what a disappointment from beginning to end .
paid extra for vip service which was a total waste of $ .
some were down right rude .
credit card charges were all wrong and left for us to fix .
it 's obvious that customer service is n't a priority .
spend a little extra money and head for the strip !
it would rate a _num_ .
they do not know quality , nor how to run a hotel at all .
poorly trained staff , barely at a minimum .
can u spell ripoff .
horrible attitude , minimal staffing , no management who knows better .
do not expect much , and you will not be disappointed .
almost missed my flight .
customer service sucked .
i have never stayed at this hotel .
they all hate being there !
i feel bad for them .
it says a lot about a place when they treat their employees badly .
we have stayed here _num_ times in the last _num_ months .
1st time was my original review .
this time , not so good .
there was a room cleanliness problem .
upgraded to the gold tower for three nights .
worst experience ever !
we checked in at 2pm and checked out at 9pm the same day .
so yeah , completely fail on the experience here .
let me start by saying i do n't give many one star reviews .
but our experience was horrible .
the room reeked of smoke .
terrible customer service .
needless to say i did n't last long .
check in was terrible right now .
the concierge was taking forever with this guy that had no reservations .
cheap rooms , crowded pool equals nasty smoking people and nasty dirty pool water .
shark tank is cool but the crowds are not .
had a so-so experience here .
i checked out very early morning and they were unable to print my receipt .
another day goes by with no response so i emailed .
got sick eating at claim jumper in the casino .
the only cool thing was the pool .
before booking , check to see if they have events planned for the weekend .
not an isolated incident , happened every night of our weekend stay .
the man at the front desk gave me incorrect information multiple times .
now , why wo n't i stay here again ?
gold towers upgraded $ _num_ worst upgrade ever .
first time staying here probably my last .
they did n't care .
the tv had problems as well and maintenance had to come out .
every interaction we had with staff was rude .
i wrote an e-mail and have never received response .
however when i informed groupon about our experience they refunded me .
i was shocked and not expecting that at all .
groupon rocks but golden nugget stinks !
once we got to golden nugget valet , valet was full .
when we arrived , it was super busy .
the worst part was people swimming in their clothes .
not terrible , but for the price you can do much better .
we left our bags at the counter and went exploring .
now i have four tired kids and an annoyed husband and i was pissed .
i am not a person to yell but i friggin ' lost it .
you need your card key to get into the pool .
when he got to the pool his card key did n't work .
he was horribly embarrassed .
so she could continue to check in other guests .
have not stayed here prior .
no thanks .
customer service in the hotel was horrible !
rooms a day and how she does n't like getting sent to other floors .
no complaints on room , clean and well done .
as it was my mom , my husband and myself we needed _num_ beds .
first , the beds were too high .
what they brought did n't really work .
she does n't even have a big chair .
unfortunately , the nice guys in the poker room were not enough .
we only stayed here because my husband had to for work .
it 's not a place i would 've picked myself .
the staff was not very helpful .
the valet is the worst !
the pool was always over crowded so we did n't even attempt that !
however , our room ( in the carson towers ) was horrible .
the room looked old and outdated .
there was n't anything nice about it .
very disappointed with the booking process .
with service like this , you should be ashamed of your customer service policies .
tv channels were very limited , maybe _num_ or so ?
picture did not come in very well .
ugh .
and the grotto which has horrible pizza .
but of course , you would only know if you could see the sign .
i have been coming here for _num_ years and am very disappointed .
i booked a gold luxury room with vip check in .
check in was fine except she checked me in under the wrong name .
could not find our bags at the bell desk .
sorry we do n't have your claim check what do your bags look like .
guess we will not be sleeping much .
besides , your entire hotel sucks anyway .
they asked for the card for a security deposit , never mentioned these charges .
i had stayed with them three times previously , but no more .
was thirty minutes late and they sold my room ?
completely ruined my plans and night almost .
worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
where to begin with our complaints ?
at check out they tried to charge us twice for all of nights stay .
the golden nugget has definitely changed for the worse !
where to begin ?
got keys to our room and bell person took our bags .
it was filthy and appeared to not have been vacuumed .
i called housekeeping and they sent the housekeeping supervisor doug filter ( sp ? )
there was no room and i would have to self park .
golden nugget used to be a standard in excellence .
there is no complimentary coffee offered in the room either !
_num_ dollars to drink a cup of coffee !
next time , i will spend less money and stay at the grand .
shame on you golden nugget your glory days are gone .
do n't let the downstairs fool you !
i am very disappointed with my stay thus far .
i 've stayed here before , but it appears their standards have dropped .
this is very disappointing , considering that we are paying customers .
they do not have enough parking in the valet or self parking .
basically the management does not care .
most slots were _num_ cent .
only thing i would praise them on is their pool .
terrible hotel .
i would give them zero stars .
terrible customer service !
i quickly booked another room so i had a place to stay .
this is when our horrible weekend began .
it took over _num_ min to resolve the whole issue .
just waiting for a resolution so i guess i 'll write more later .
the roast beef was okay but the lack of fresh veggies was disappointing .
disappointed .
worst spa experience ever !
finally _num_ mins into my massage i ca n't take it .
so when i complained about my experience they added an additional _num_ % off .
at that time they required my credit card , big mistake !
reviewed my credit statement later and was billed for $ _num_ .
your only option is to leave a voicemail , so i did .
called again , nothing !
that 's nice , cause i 've never eaten there in my life !
_num_ days go by , nothing !
i was very dissapointed with my stay .
instead the check out agent told me that it does n't work that way .
after _num_ hours i called them back .
really was n't impressed .
i was there for business and stayed in the carson tower .
the tub would randomly back up and leave a black ring around the drain .
the carpet was gross .
no refrigerator in room you can rent one for $ _num_ a day .
when they came in it was basically thrown at me .
overall did n't enjoy my stay here at all .
plus , the overhead music was far too loud for a hotel .
( we paid _num_ dollars extra for that ) the room was beautiful !
anyway ... we decided to use the hot tub .
so the hubby calls housekeeping , they do n't answer .
half an hour later , hubby calls again , not in a good mood .
my hubby is pissed now !
so , be warned that golden nugget does sell your private information .
i would never stay there again .
with this inconvenience you would think they would of upgraded our room our something .
very sleazy business practices .
we booked the room on line for $ _num_ per night .
i asked to have this removed and they refused .
again , a very sleazy business practice .
she said that they do not refund the $ _num_ resort fee .
she said it was $ _num_ and walked away .
so $ _num_ for water and a bud light and she tipped herself ?
it ca n't move .
the only offer bottle beers , no drafts = no value .
the pool area is way too small .
and there 's no where else to sit !
their pool areas are more spacious and luxurious .
not to mention the pool was not full !
this hotel was more expensive than the average vegas stay .
i would not stay here again .
horrible beds in the room .
my wife and _num_ kids had the worst sleep because of the beds .
stay somewhere else , at least you will get a good night sleep .
second time i stayed here trying to cut costs .
the rooms were incredibly dirty with a few dead bugs on the floor .
the bathtub looked like it had n't been cleaned .
the coffee in the room costs _num_ for _num_ packets .
ie : _num_ cups .
f this place .
and last time took _num_ hours to get back in room .
never again golden nugget .
ridiculous !
i work at caesars palace and we would never do this to customers .
the hotel screwed up my reservation and blame me for the mistake .
the water had a foul odor and seem hard .
not worth a second visit .
this place also has the nerve to charge for there slow internet .
what stupid person would pay for that coffee when star bucks down stairs .
they 're money hungry and have nothing to offer .
lastly their pool is not great and often over crowded .
i have n't even stayed yet , and i am already disappointed .
i still have not received a response after my second e-mail .
this place is not even worthy of _num_ star .
we have _num_ employees total on this trip .
not the end of the world , but the reservation was still wrong .
my boss was was placed in a handicap smoking room .
worst check in experience of my life .
total nightmare .
jen at the front desk is terrible .
simple request of having house keeping is not ok at the golden nugget .
if you do not like your job quit .
yes they 'll make the beds , empty the trash and change the linens .
he said i needed to put more money in the machine .
hell , i started off with a hundred !
neither one of the card keys worked well on the doors .
i got in early wednesday but as expected , there were no rooms clean .
then there 's this new resort fee .
today is sunday , april _num_ , _num_ .
i 'm still here and i ca n't wait to checkout tomorrow !
my husband was very bothered by how she treated us .
what a disappointment you are .
guess freemont has them thinking they can lock shit down .
the golden nugget has _num_ star rooms and _num_ star service .
claim jumper was pretty tasty though service was bad .
if i wanted to complain , i 'd have to call someone else .
such a bummer because this was my favorite vegas hotel .
my girlfriend and i recently stay here and we had a horrible experience .
i was so disappointed with this hotel !
we booked the spa suite for one night .
confused we said `` is n't 3pm check in time for all rooms ? ''
golden nugget just left a sour taste in my mouth .
this was by far the worst hotel stay in my entire life .
golden gate is my go to place for fremont street .
the women there were mediocre .
the food was also mediocre at a high price .
this is where i had the worst service in my life .
it was a complete waste of time and money .
if you like being treated like garbage stay here .
nobody else in her office would assist us .
in short do not recommend the golden nugget for your special event .
had the worst time of my life staying there last week .
i would 've rather stayed at a motel _num_ .
we were there for five days and it was just pure hell .
there is even a water slide that goes through the tank .
parking structure : one elevator worked , and one was broken .
no a/c either in the elevators .
elevators : no a/c .
it was n't something i felt was becoming a nice place .
i wish i could give _num_ stars , unfortunately that is not an option !
i asked for the manager and the clerk walked away .
again , this was unacceptable .
so far ... they are horrible .
housekeeping here is terrible !
pool is cool but annoying with lots of kids .
i recently stayed at the golden nugget for _num_ nights .
then i noticed several more bugs crawling next to the bed .
they refused to do anything about the issue .
i would have expected so much more from a large hotel like this one .
not worth it .
also this was n't a unique experience .
got here checked in sorry king only smoking .
get in there there 's a crusty dirty towel hanging in the bathroom .
bottle caps at the foot of the bed .
room change update .
i would not recommend this place for a family .
i will not be staying here again .
remember that valet parking is free just tip them on your way out .
the pool area sucks .
someone random person was in my room at 4am .
either way , the way security and risk management handled the situation was pathetic .
honestly they were down right rude .
they were very unprofessional and do not care about their guests .
do n't offer anything for this inconvenience .
i go to check out today and of course its wrong .
businesses charge these little extra fees because they think you wo n't notice it .
i have to say this was my worst hotel experience ever !
he offered $ _num_ off our hotel rooms and nothing else .
worst part of my experience here is checking in .
this hotel would be a lot better if it had working elevators .
the coffee and water in your room are not complimentary .
would much rather pay $ _num_ for the starbucks downstairs .
so the fremont street experience is not exactly family friendly .
not too happy .
unfortunately their managers are awful , rude and with poor table side manner .
just too many rules with poor delivery find somewhere else .
do not stay here .
my husband and i booked _num_ rooms here and brought our teenage boys .
first of all , the parking is ridiculous .
the parking structure is difficult to access .
it 's approximately _num_ block away and packed with vehicles .
that does n't include the wait standing in line to check in .
we could have stayed somewhere else on fremont street for less !
the roof was leaking and the ceiling lights were still on !
a complete safety hazard not to mention a law suit waiting to happen .
our room was your typical room ... nice .
also , cable channels sucked .
ridiculous !
not surprised .
i will not be returning .
the club is the worst club ever .
the bartender tired to short me on a drink .
when i complained and said i 'm not paying for it .
he called security and they tried to make me pay for it .
if i could give it negative stars i would .
stench .
it is not .
this whole stay was shitty for lack of a better word .
then the towel thing , ordered _num_ body towels and got _num_ hand towels ?
ugh .
it took _num_ minutes just to get to the front of the line .
however , good luck on trying to get a comped room .
no sense of urgency or recovery of any kind !
then we come back and the door is not working .
this hotel , however , is a disorganized mess .
the front desk clerk told me they would call me when it was ready .
he did n't offer to check my luggage .
but this dude did n't tell me that .
on this trip we stayed in the rush tower on the 20th floor .
disappointing but okay .
worst sports book in vegas .
small , smokey , dark and rude management .
there is very limited seating .
the management asks you to leave if you 're not a hotel guest .
the pool area has _num_ people fighting for _num_ chairs .
the golden nugget lv is not ready for prime time .
that morning we come to find out it 's been stolen from our room .
ugh .
point is stay away from this place if you value your belongings .
there were many things to do , i mean it 's vegas right .
the bath curtain was dirty and reeked .
it was just really nasty .
it was my husbands birthday so we went to the italian restaurant for dinner .
downtown vegas is a sleazy rundown dump .
and they basically just shrugged their shoulders ... horrible will never go back there !
not exactly thrilled with the golden nugget hotel .
just a little disappointing , especially for the price we paid .
which i felt was way over priced .
will not be staying here again .
the staff was nice , but the hotel and rooms were not .
terrible .
somebody could have been hiding in either of the rooms .
after i made the recommendation , i 'm none too happy .
do n't think that i will stay there again .
not impressed .
this place is horrible !
bad signage and the rooms smell .
never stay here again .
i do not understand why this hotel has the reviews it has .
shortly after , my husband noticed surface mold in the bathroom .
overall our stay was , at most , mediocre .
they promised us a compensation but still have not received it .
i feel like they are not taking us seriously and insulting us .
the band at the fremont street experience is way too loud .
feels like cost cutting with total disregard for the customer .
disappointing .
the pool was fun , we rented a cabana .
it was fast , but so unfriendly .
our jr corner suite room was huge .
the only thing we did not like was the little window .
it was ridiculous .
it was so handy to go to other casinos and others restaurants .
you just do n't get dressed up in this part of vegas .
but really , we will not be doing it again .
wrong , i noticed them and had them taken off .
for example , parking is not complimentary .
i play the slots and poker but never here .
there are better casinos here .
not for locals .
ps long wait for the poker room as well .
worst experience of my life .
my fianc is allergic to smoke so we kept asking for a non smoking .
they offered us an upgrade for _num_ $ more a night .
ridiculous .
ridiculous service .
the room was nice , pillows are god awful too soft .
damn shame .
extremely small room with a view of the side of another building up close .
strange stains in the bathroom sink !
the service here is terrible , booked a room at rush tower .
park and walk up to check in and they said it 's closed .
after walking and moving the car lost thirty minutes .
that is terrible all i hear is the band outside .
first issue is the check in lines take forever .
second issue , the internet is just awful and so slow .
the tv channels they offer you are very limited as well .
the staff was cordial & professional , so the problem must be ownership .
it was a non-smoking suite , yet the pillows smelled of cigars .
the bath amenities were noticeably low quality .
save your money and stay somewhere where your money is appreciated .
probably the worst area of the hotel if you have kids .
our room practically shook all weekend from the constant music until _num_ am .
the only silver lining was the starbucks in the lobby .
in my opinion , certainly not worth the money for what you get .
there are much better options closer to the strip for comparable rates .
just got back from the nugget and i would not stay there again .
the ventilation system in the casino is horrible .
as another reviewer had said , the room was dusty .
each time i was on hold _num_ plus minutes .
in short the cleaning and maintenance was lousy .
i did the fast check out on the tv with no problem .
we were originally in the carson tower , but upgraded to the rush tower .
assume the clubs were a few floors above us .
terrible experience so far .
we booked _num_ months in advance and requested a non smoking room .
will not be staying here again .
its really frustrating that someone would even take a water bottle ... .
what the hell ?
gross .
i know they tried to upgrade rooms but not so great .
also it smells like cigarettes ugh .
service is horrible at the bars .
the rooms are a little beat up and super noisy from fremont street .
do n't plan on getting any sleep .
may try this place again but was n't what i expected .
by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed at !
horrible horrible customer service !
the manager of the hotel is a absolute joke !
got the room thru priceline which was 1st mistake .
but , then a maid tried to enter our room about midnight .
at that point we had not requested anything .
last night , while staying at the golden nugget , we were robbed .
it happened after we went to sleep , while we were in the room .
so disappointed , i would never have so little empathy for anyone .
last night , while staying at the golden nugget , we were robbed .
it happened after we went to sleep , while we were in the room .
so disappointed , i would never have so little empathy for anyone .
sleeping is a nightmare !
wo n't be staying her in the future .
just not my thing .
i 'm a reasonably serious gym rat and this gym is really sub-par .
think your generic marriott or westin .
very disappointed .
i booked a room in the rush towers .
the main lobby had _num_ other guests in front of us .
not an exaggeration .
i called front desk and they sent security to the room .
he filled out a report and gave me the case number .
very very very disappointed !
not even their fish tank and swimming pool , would make up for this .
staying at the carson tower is great and cheap .
i throw money in the machine and she takes my order .
go through it quickly and go back to watching my bf .
we cash out and leave immediately with the beer .
regret tipping her still .
how tacky .
even if i did n't gamble all night , my boyfriend is .
they were extremely rude about it .
the waitresses do n't walk by to serve drinks even if you 're gambling .
no one was even behind the counter for a majority of that .
we made reservation in early january for a late march visit .
$ _num_ a piece a day !
everything about the golden nugget is a money grab .
the restaurants are expensive and the machines are tight .
we were wrong .
bottom line we will not ever stay at the golden nugget again .
the room we had , in the carson tower , was adequate .
the bed was comfortable , and the air conditioning worked well .
we ate at the buffet and it was pretty bad .
nothing was done .
however , it 's just kind of dumpy .
room was disgusting .
there was hair in my salad and everything was cold .
so very disappointed .
she just grabbed the money without even looking at us .
this year was a disappointment .
dingy halls and room .
room was outdated in decor for sure !
waitresses in casino floor not very prompt in serving drinks .
i will not be staying here again .
and their resort fees are a scam .
no fridge .
huge line at the check in , small busy pool .
horrible .
i would leave no stars if i could .
we checked out sunday so i ca n't imagine too many people checking in .
all in all , a very mediocre experience .
this is the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
i brought my bag to the bell desk and checked in at 10am .
i requested my room and my friends room be next each other .
my friends got there at _num_ and checked in and their room was ready .
i went back and they said housekeeping was in my room cleaning .
they said they were sending my bag up .
_num_ mins later still no bag .
i called the front desk _num_ times to inquire and got no answer .
i went down and they told me the bag was on its way .
_num_ mins later i was still waiting so i called again , no answer .
went down to the desk again to request check out and move hotels .
my room window was literally a brick wall .
the room keys hardly work .
the buffet food is horrible .
i do not recommend anyone ever stay at this terribly ran establishment .
the worst place ever !
disgusting rooms and everything is beat up .
disgusting !
negative stars ... will never come back .
do n't waste your money .
real hero 's do not want recognition or money for pictures .
room was clean , but bad fit and finish .
this place has gone downhill .
apparently , they do n't care at all about the carson tower .
booked a king bed suite for an anniversary week getaway .
i complained and received a complimentary room for one night .
$ _num_ for a phone call in the age of unlimited long distance calls .
the worst customer service ever .
the hotel hallway was dirty on the 6th floor .
the same cart from room service sat in the hallway for _num_ days .
the manager wayne yelled at my daughter and called her a liar .
very disgusted .
terrible .
i kind of feel bad for their employees .
clearly , the management is struggling .
when we got there , the lady at the desk was very rude .
this was our first time staying here and we were really excited about it .
after that it all fell apart .
the first room we were in had broken ac so they switched our room .
the room was much nicer and everything worked properly so that was cool .
it was a very disappointing experience .
the employees are very rude even the managers .
i honestly only give them _num_ star because the pool is pretty awesome .
horrible .
horrible .
such bad treatment of paying patrons !
if you are too cold then they say too bad tough it .
you ca n't take a towel from the pool to keep warm either .
avoid if you want to have a relaxing time in vegas .
i lost $ _num_ last month !
she said but it 's not showing !
not my fault !
why am i still receiving emails ?
the yard drinks were very nice none the less .
however another guy nearby was n't going to tip , apparently .
she refused to just walk away .
i guess this must be part of the fremont street experience too !
either way , he pissed me off .
poor service playing slot and could not get a drink .
cocktail servers seem to ignore me i 'm a regular local customer .
finally did get a drink but lost _num_ dollars waiting for that drink .
i think strip is better for friendly cocktail servers with customers being first .
will not mention names but i know who you are .
so gross .
wo n't be back .
staff was rude and this place was a joke .
ill never step foot in there again .
dont waste your time .
as far as pawn shop shows go i suppose .
meh , as jessica would say .
it 's a crappy tourist trap now .
other than jewelry , there wasnt much inventory to speak of .
there were moments of cool when i recognized something from the show .
from the store perspective , it is a pawn shop .
by far the biggest disappointment of our trip to vegas .
the place is far away from the strip casinos .
and they were n't kidding , they kicked everybody out about five minutes later .
in reality , five minutes was probably about all we needed anyway .
we were terribly disappointed at the size of the shop .
i feel like there should have been a better selection .
waste of time !
only go there if you love their show ... .
i ca n't imagine how that would work .
i guess you just got ta be sneaky .
do you hate your job that much ?
needless to say , i got out of there pretty quickly .
most of it is not cleaned up and in dull looking shape .
these people will also not deal with you on items .
the parking is an absolute joke .
you ca n't check-out or create an account .
filled out the on-line contact form weeks ago and no response .
wife and i drove past the store on a monday around ten am .
went late at night and was not crowded at all .
a & e choose this % # it hole !
like i really want to advertise for your show .
some staff are rude .
some other staff stepped in and was a little more helpful .
go there just once , then , do n't look back .
and , do n't expect the see the pawn stars .
i was dragged here by the gf and a friend .
none of the people from the show were there as i expected .
overall the place is very small and very over priced .
not worth your time , unless your a fan of the show .
you 're not going to see anyone from the show there .
i 'm not .
but for me , that 's not how i roll .
the place is just nasty .
you will see a few old men just not the old man .
what a disappointment .
sad to stand in line to go in there .
too sad .
do n't bother bringing any business to this store .
i have never been talked to like that before in my life .
i am def no longer a fan because of my experience just calling them .
i guess being rude to customers is how they do it .
this place is a piece of crap .
love the show , but the store sucks .
they have a whole bunch of crappy overpriced items .
waste of time .
small , overpriced , lame .
not worth the visit .
it 's a tourist store with little to nothing to purchase .
would not waste my time going there .
go in the morning and there is no line to get in .
as a pawn shop its pretty boring .
just a pawn shop with expensive stuff .
too much pawn stars tee shirts and junk .
as a big fan of the show , i was really disappointed .
at that point i was done and just left , disappointed and somewhat disgusted .
it 's just your average pawn shop that looks much bigger on tv .
did pick up a shirt for my dad though so not a wasted trip .
beware , the line to even get in the door can be long too .
lame , lame , lame !
let me say that none of the cast is here .
you go inside and it is nothing like the tv show .
the outside is also nothing like it is in the show .
i did not see anyone buying much but complaining about prices .
i will not be coming back here .
go to fremont street and get a football full of beer instead .
actually visiting the shop ruined pawn stars for me !
none of the cast was out , so that was pretty disappointing .
there was no freakin way i was waiting in that line .
my buddy was a die hard however and stayed .
he said nothing inside was for sale except for t-shirts and crap .
frankly it is a dump with not much of anything for sale .
seriously it must take up _num_ % of the store .
the tv celebrities no longer work the counters .
what a total waste of time .
_num_ percent is filled with shirts , mugs , and other pawn stars merchandise .
had to wait in line outside for about _num_ minutes .
you wo n't see anybody on the show here either .
i finally get a chance to visit pawn stars !
and you know what ?
if you like long lines and disappointment this is the place for you .
like a few other people mentioned , there really is n't much for sale .
very disappointed !
otherwise it looks just like any other pawn shop place anywhere else .
wait times vary from _num_ mins to an hour ( come on , really ?
about halfway down towards the back are mostly pawn shop souvenirs .
only the pawn shop section is open _num_ hours .
do n't get too excited .
they are usually in the back doing whatever .
so overall , do n't waste your time .
i live here so that 's why i gave them _num_ stars .
did n't think the walk was too bad .
i was pissed because we already walked that far .
so , we walked to the stratosphere casino & hotel to stop for drinks .
we walk in and i was gathering a couple of souvenirs .
the main characters of the show are not there .
it is a small shop with about _num_ employees .
the items they had were really not that impressive .
they buy souvenirs to take home and let others know they were there .
not worth it .
sorry , but this place was super disappointing !
this was not the case , the shop is fairly run down and dirty .
sorry , but do n't waste your time .
it is very misleading .
not as big of a ripoff as mine though and it 's nice .
nothing special , just over priced .
flat out .
i was shocked when he was so rude !
ill watch it on tv but sure as hell wont go back !
this was the worst experience .
the staff was rude .
it was n't even crowded yet !
i guess they are nice only when the cameras are on .
a total disappointment .
we are n't watching their show anymore .
this place sucked .
read his review and pretend i said the exact same thing .
they only have big ticket items and tv show memorabilia .
the stars of the show wo n't even come say hi to anyone .
you really , really do n't .
do n't waste your time .
but if you have to go , do n't wait in line .
well , it took _num_ minutes but we made it inside .
it was just an average pawn shop nothing special .
lame .
one of my friends always makes the worst suggestions .
there was n't much to see in the pawn shop .
it 's , uh , it sure is ... small in here .
it does not .
bottom line they kept it and sold it for much more than $ _num_ .
when the sign outside gold and silver pawn says `` open _num_ hours '' ?
if i could give this place negative stars , i would .
you do n't need to be asking the same question a million times '' .
the only reason people visit this place is because of the tv show .
the pawn shop itself is nothing grand either .
my family & i visited the shop this past super bowl weekend .
the line was really long and the shop was disappointing .
what a disappointment .
do not waste your time and taxi money to come here !
the pawn shop is not the tv show .
i 've been to quite a few pawn shops .
this was nothing to write home about .
i would absolutely not waste your time .
it 's not .
wo n't go back and would n't recommend .
otherwise , it was a super disappointment .
it just did not live up to all the hype that i expected .
it was good to stop by but nothing special .
i 'll remain a fan of the show but this was a let down .
so , i finally decided to check out gold and silver pawn .
it is indeed , just that .
rude staff by phone .
i was disappointed with their inventory .
`` , however .
lots of parking , but be prepared to wait in line !
it was the day after christmas so it was n't to crowded .
the shop is your average pawn shop a bit dingy and old looking .
not impressed at all .
there was absolutely nothing i wanted to purchase here .
how rude .
it is now like an amusement park .
in fact , the only items moving were the merchandise .
the items that were for sale was quite expensive .
of course , none of the cast members were there .
as other posters noted , the store is actually not that big .
plus , it is a complete side show outside .
pretty much just one long hallway with a little room at the end .
particularly the merchandise that was advertised as `` as seen on pawn stars . ''
it has very few pawn items and what is there is outrageously priced !
they do n't even film at the counters that you see .
a total waste of time .
you will not see anyone from the show .
you are allowed to take pictures but not in the direction of their offices .
but , we did however find out it was open 24hrs .
it has now been _num_ weeks since we 've been home .
wrong .
_num_ weeks and no answer .
i 'll find someplace else for my vegas memorabilia .
_num_ % of the store is now merchandise with their faces on it .
so why does this place get _num_ stars ?
but other than a _num_ minute look you should be ready to leave .
walked in and the gentleman was on the phone and yelling for a employee .
before i could tell him what i had he said not interested .
there was no reason to back up as to why .
luckily the line moved very quickly , _num_ minutes at the most .
complete disappointment .
showed no interest in helping .
my wife was in vegas last week for a conference .
she was disappointed to find out that none of the fantastic _num_ were there .
she was sad ; ( .
disappointment .
it seems that all this place is now is a tourist trap .
small and cramped nothing like what it looks like on tv .
do n't waste your time .
first pass by there was a long line down the sidewalk .
drove by a little later and no line so we parked and went in .
my jaw dropped ... ... not in a good way .
what a hole .
staff there is cold and not so friendly .
last year very disappointing .
sorry customers are such an inconvenience .
the shop is small and unimpressive .
i 'm glad i did n't wait in line to see this place .
now i think of them as sick and big loss .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
the place is very , very small .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
* reality shows are created every day .
it wo n't last forever .
jewelry collection is small and not to interesting .
lots of cheap new jewelry .
my fiancee and i got there about _num_ minutes before the shop opened .
then shop opened and we walked in and looked around .
used watches are priced higher than brand new .
pawn stars rip off artists !
when i got inside , the disappointment started .
this pawn shop is very small , tv makes it look bigger .
does not look like the show in some ways .
this is your typical case of show business going to your head .
it looks like only about _num_ % of the people leaving bought anything .
they have a little area in the parking lot to buy snacks .
disappointing , the place is tiny and not worth it .
i would n't go back expecting to actually see them working the floor .
this place does not warrant it .
i was very unimpressed .
do not pay the $ _num_ for the pawn star tour .
do n't bother waiting in line for _num_ min .
a definite waste of valuable vegas time .
it really was a let down .
my husband and i were thinking that there would be more than just jewelry .
plus some of the items were hard to really see .
tons of coins , not my thing .
but not really alot .
like someone else said , half the store is their own merchandise .
but would not come back on our next trip to vegas .
not worth the $ _num_ cab ride from the strip .
the store itself is small and has a very unwelcoming feel to it .
tacky and so not worth it .
save yourself the time and money , do n't go .
could have been professional about it , ended up just being an asshole .
terrible service .
he gave me a picture of the group and also signed it for me .
there was no line and hardly anyone in the place .
we drove up and i could not believe the line to get in .
my friends very disappointed .
i did not see any cool antiques .
kinda depressing overall , as was vegas in general .
i am a fan of the show but would not recommend visiting the store .
none of the stars were there and it looks different than on the show .
we just got back from vegas , and visiting this pawn shop .
overall a disappointing experience .
i asked a clerk what i could buy for $ _num_ .
your store however , eh .
i was driving so i could n't take down any information .
i called back _num_ times and was ignored .
not much of a fan to begin with .
really would have been annoyed if i had to pay to get in .
at least i can say i 've been there , done that .
this place is just a tourist trap .
more than half the stuff they sell is souvenirs ( junk ) .
the other half is over priced as far as i 'm concerned .
no website for shopping ?
not much to see here .
nothing for an average person to buy except a $ _num_ t shirt .
must expensive cotton t shirt in vegas .
i bet you can figure it out .
_num_ % tourist trap .
disappointed .
all in all it was a waste of valuable time in vegas .
very disappointing !
absolutely ridiculous .
was so rude to me .
joked with him about having the same shirt .
just told me no i have mine and you have yours .
so i left .
horrible customer service .
wo n't ever be going back .
the place looks ok on the show but is a pit on the outside .
they did n't have it .
i was really disappointed .
i was very disappointed in our experience with the gold and silver pawn shop .
selection did not meet my expectation and many items were not priced well .
store was crowded and some of the staff was rude .
everything is over priced so know they totally rip people off .
if you are bored , go watch the sand in blow in the wind .
however it was very disappointing .
inside was very lame .
not really anything interesting that was n't extremely inflated prices .
they looked so dirty like come on .
hopefully , this will save other fans some time .
the immediate area is sleazy , so do n't go wandering off somewhere .
there 's no public bathrooms nearby either , so keep that in mind also .
okay , this turned out to be not so short .
i guess i had more than i thought to get off my chest .
i was amazed by the overpriced junk that was in the shop .
_num_ % of the stuff i would n't want if it was free .
my expectations were low and they were not met .
the worst part is i definitely felt like a stupid tourist .
i should have just stayed on the strip .
it is in a sleazy part of town and it is a pawn shop .
otherwise it would be just another pawn shop .
not much to see when u get there .
this place is more for show .
i would not come back here again .
if people are thinking about coming here it 's not worth the drive .
nice to see , but did n't know it was such a dumpy place .
not too impressed at all !
it was just another pawn shop and not the cleanest , either .
not going to come back to visit again .
waste of gas coming here .
just imagine any pawn shop and u already came here .
gold and silver pawn shop which is the tv show home of pawn stars .
long and you have no room to walk in the store .
what a disappointment .
none of the tv actors are even there .
it 's really crowded inside .
horrible .
do n't waste your time .
there is n't another collection like this out there .
would n't even look at it .
i was told , unless it was related to someone famous .
not really a fan of the show .
what i saw was a long narrow room .
mostly jewelry coins etc .
nothing like what you see on tv .
employee mike and other employee laugh at me .
it is not the tv show people .
overall horrible experience .
but he 's not there anymore and they know that .
they want you to spend money waiting in the bar .
it is crowded and you will have to wait to look into the cases .
never going back .
dont be stupid and do your research .
i do n't see how this is a business .
the only great thing about this pawn shop is that its on tv .
the place was overcrowded and was very hot .
not some place i would go to buy used items .
very disappointed .
skip it as a tourist attraction and pawn shop .
the on line cost was $ _num_ .
the individual at the desk clearly did not like that i was prepared .
then he said it was a print , and not the real map .
if you want to do business , forget about it !
no thank you .
we all went to meet the people and no they are not there .
cause i did n't see anyone .
kinda disappointing .
what a horrible pawn shop !
what a bunch of crap .
only when my husband questioned him did he say he was joking .
do n't waste your time here .
also , i was surprised by the lack of merchandise .
of course , none of the stars were there .
nothing worth even half of their prices .
very mean and rude there .
way way way overrated and crazy stupid prices .
extremely disappointed in the quality of products this place sells .
not even two weeks later four of the smaller diamonds have fallen out .
what an extreme waste of $ _num_ .
i 've seen better stuff in other pawn shops .
i still feel most of the items are over priced .
worst pawn shop i ever walked in ... !
visited back in march .
not much to see .
counter people were friendly but their merchandise is limited and way over priced .
you can get much better deals elsewhere .
glad i went to visit but i wo n't be back !
sadly , they were not open twenty four hours as advertised .
unfortunately they were all out of our bagel chips .
_num_ hours of driving and no bagel chips .
did n't feel the aloha spirit there !
the course to get there is a little awkward .
$ _num_ for a tube ?
not worth the time and money for all this .
that would have been good to know before i sent him everything .
obviously i was not pleased with the outcome .
_num_ stars .
first of all , paying to park is outdated , if you ask me .
paid for parking but could not locate a handicap spot .
will not return regardless of the venue .
i have never been treated sooo poorly or left an establishment feeling so unsatisfied !
i will be filing a bbb report !
the only reason i have it _num_ star was because i had to .
it 's a bit cramped in the aisles and it 's not very organized .
parking is ample and the staff ... it 's hit or miss .
i went to this place twice on separate days .
not attentive at all .
do n't you want to make money ?
i received mediocre customer service from the fitting room attendant wearing glasses .
her attitude was unwelcoming and depressing .
i went here for halloween makeup and the staff was pretty unwelcoming .
i have never thrown away a pizza .
the amount of cheese and grease .
and trust me i never complain about pizza .
however , they have other things on the menu i 'm going to try .
do n't listen to me , you might like it .
but me and _num_ others did not like it one bit .
wow , i ordered hot wings and got only one stick of celery haha .
no mushrooms ?
waiting for a cold pizza !
much less a bad cold pizza !
it is scary and drug dealers live there .
i did not get what i wanted .
i order meat and cheese with pickles , mayo , salt n pepper .
um no you did n't .
i tipped her too and she was still so rude .
not only was our food wrong , but rude people too .
no thanks .
so disappointed !
my wallet is sad now .
when i lived in vegas , this was my favorite buffet .
it was just that bad .
trust me , it 's not the same .
can you imagine spending _num_ bucks for a buffet ?
there just was n't anything that memorable .
but even she ca n't save this place from a two star review .
line was n't too long .
signed up for their players club so dinner was about $ _num_ each .
it was in some kind of bland creamy sauce which garlic had never met .
it was tough , and full of fat and gristle .
salads - green salad was rusty and wilted .
did n't try any others but as far as presentation - very lacking .
mexican entres - looked bad , very bad , only tried the taquitos .
perhaps they are making cuts in the quality of their ingredients .
_num_ prime rib .
yelpers , you let me down .
i do n't know if the lunch or dinner is any better .
it 's just a regular buffet nothing special !
wrong !
seriously , the only good thing about the entire visit was the salad bar .
i do n't really know how to review this place .
even the breakfast buffet at circus circus could out do this one .
from start to finish , this was a horrible breakfast experience .
also , the parking attendant was a complete jerk , when asked about it .
insult to injury at that point .
the selection and quality of food was absolutely terrible .
bread products were obviously frozen and/or made elsewhere .
bread still in its plastic bags was left out for toast .
the shrimp was ok and easy enough to peel but were very small .
if you like the above mentioned seafood items then have at it .
it 's only $ _num_ .
but even for that price , we would n't go back again .
the coffee was the worst we 've ever had .
it was served in plastic mugs and was very watery .
i could barely drink it .
the orange juice was almost as bad .
when we left around 9:30 , there was still no line .
clearly chef has no idea how to cook meat .
pork buns my daughter got were soggy and pizza was hard and like cardboard .
most things i did not try as they looked disgusting .
there was nothing fresh on the premises .
very depressing place - food , decor and clientele .
nasty to the core .
ate here on a tuesday , `` steak night '' .
the fried chicken was also slightly good .
steak was horrible .
all other foods were ok ( meh ) .
all the food was crappy .
one of the woman greeting at the front was hella rude .
the chinese food was not too bad but it was extra greasy .
the meats all looked edible .
most of the food was low quality and sort of crappy .
this buffet needs to be updated .
i have been going to main street hotel and casino for about _num_ years .
i spent more time waiting in line to eat than i actually did eating .
the service sucked .
i am no longer eating there again !
it 's an ok buffet , but nothing really stands out .
line was ridiculous .
i made sure to not have any dessert .
a full dining area with no a/c made for a really bad dinner .
im sure it was just an isolated incident - but they handled it poorly .
however if you want good food for a good price go somewhere else .
there is absolutely no taste .
so if you 're looking for a good downtown buffet try the golden nugget .
you ca n't go wrong .
i ate here for breakfast for _num_ days and dinner for _num_ day .
whats up with that nasty spray you now spray your omelettes with ?
whats up with all the canned salsa ?
there was one tomato and onion dish that was more onion than tomato .
are fresh tomatoes too costly ?
hard , no cinnamon and no butter .
your apple pie has no apples , all syrup filling .
chicken , ribs , most meat dishes are tough and dry .
frozen chicken patty that you call chicken parmigiana .
the food quality and selection were not good .
the desserts looked as if they had been prepared by wal-mart .
i will not be going back for seconds .
we went the next thursday for the same featured steak and shrimp .
we immediately stacked the plates with the steaks for removal .
we tipped the waiter and left , it was n't his fault .
we will never go to the main street station garden court buffet again .
last time we were in vegas this placed rated a strong _num_ star .
was a disappointment .
so went for sunday breakfast on mothers day and what a disappointment .
we will not be going back here again for several more years .
1st disappointment was , no kalua pork & cabbage .
2nd disappointment was pizza was not fresh .
3rd disappointment was enchiladas was dried up & stuck to pan .
there were enough chefs standing around .
shame on you !
still craving kalua pork & cabbage .
absolutely mediocre .
fatty beef , dry chicken , bad bleu cheese .
i will not be back .
mediocre buffet .
but now it has been just too bad with some not edible items .
is it horrible .
even the country style hash browns we 're some frozen crap .
asked for chocolate milk and they only have plain milk .
felt like i was eating in a cafeteria .
prime rib is the only decent dish .
rice dish sucks , even breakfast eggs has weird taste .
never coming back to this place .
yesterday was one of my few bad experiences here .
this experience started off promising .
by 5:30 pm , a line to the cashier had developed .
but forget about the service , i was disappointed with the food .
no way !
there are a few reasons why yesterday i was disappointed with the food .
first off , sushi which is currently my favorite buffet food was nonexistent .
no sushi whatsoever .
the fish was unappealing .
why did it taste like can pasta ?
horrible .
frozen veggies , prime rib was well done and dry .
not winning tonight .
the food is really bad and the selection limited .
do n't waste your time or your money .
the corn was soggy and the brisket was all fat !
today we are here for the christmas brunch and it 's terrible !
talk about buffet that was just not very good .
the craving station just had ham out that night .
the real problem is just old outdated buffet one that not with current times .
the carpet inside outdated and feels like old run down buffet .
did n't find a single dish to be seasoned .
this was really terrible food .
the salad was even bad .
the breakfast buffet here was somewhat of a disappointment for me .
think of your typical american breakfast foods .
i guess they only open it for lunch/dinner .
the pancakes with strawberry and maple syrup was probably my favorite thing .
one of my favorites is the oxtail stew which was at least _num_ stars .
the food was mediocre i didnt really like any of it .
ugh .
gross .
i had dinner here tonight .
the food on the other hand was horrible .
i was n't able to eat anything .
the best thing i tried was the kalua pig and probably the salad .
overall : i could n't eat here again .
dinner was $ _num_ per person .
i could n't go back even if dinner was a dollar .
terrible food , terrible service .
there was a group of _num_ of us and no one enjoyed it .
my _num_ year old would n't even eat the food .
very cheap lunch buffet .
food is poor and cheap .
hardly ate anything that was worth mentioning .
came from lunch , spent $ _num_ and will not return .
luckily it was only $ _num_ .
disgusting food .
if there was a way to give this place a negative _num_ i would .
worst tasting food in my life , not exaggerating .
the food was disgusting .
the so called `` glazed '' salmon tasted sweet , cold and disgusting .
wrong !
worst dessert !
my god they ca n't get anything right .
cheesecake seemed like its weeks old and had no taste .
i would have rather ate a fast food place .
the manager was clueless the staff looked miserable .
what a mess .
do n't eat here even if it 's free .
only when your not wanting to spend a lot of money on a buffet .
not worth the wait .
food served here is usually really salty .
from unhealthy sugar bomb cakes to sugar free options .
trust me you do n't want to waste your comps here .
unfortunately , after this last visit , i will no longer be returning .
_num_ minutes had now past .
i had to wait another fifteen minutes for this guy to come .
horrible experience overall .
the problem was , the quality of almost everything was terrible !
the taco meat was sitting in a pool of grease three inches deep .
but the food here is terrible .
i 'm never going to come back !
tonight : nada .
whenever i come to town i always come here , guess no more .
majority of the food seemed to sit out for awhile and it looked dry .
but the highlight was the fatty brisket .
i wo n't be coming here again .
i wished it was n't bbq night because there was an up charge .
no fancy macaroons or chocolate covered strawberries .
terrible buffet .
food was plain , tasteless .
had great service do n't get me wrong .
the food was so gross !
the crawfish inside was black and the meat was mushy .
decent selection but probably better on a night with specials .
i was planning to eat there all weekend .
these guys play the bitter old i hate women card .
i 'm a poor college student who never ever carries cash .
but luckily i found $ _num_ in my wallet that i never use .
and $ _num_ in my cd case .
then she started to talk bad about him right in front of me .
i didnt say anything but didnt think this was fair ?
i was over this , finished my pics and was out .
after a $ _num_ cab ride to get there , we were shut out .
it was an uncomfortable end and it was a feeling of being pushed out .
was a ways out of town and took awhile yo get there .
poor customer service !
the policy was not the issue though .
what was not so great was our tour guide .
many of our group were not happy .
they should have people use the bathroom before the hour long tour even starts .
had high hopes for this tour but left feeling a little disappointed .
very disappointed .
nothing said on their website !
i do n't understand why they would n't let more people walk thru .
if your tour at night you will have a difficult time getting pictures .
if it comes down to this venue or another , select the other option .
do n't waste your $ $ $ .
not really worth the time or money wasted .
i chose to visit at night .
just keep in mind there 's no shade .
or just skip this attraction completely .
you do n't have to visit this museum .
i 'm giving this place a bad review due to their poor customer service .
waste of time .
the tour guide was unprofessional and he was rude .
this place was a disappointment .
it may have been better if the signs were lit up .
i am very disappointed !
unfortunately , the tour itself was pretty much a joke .
wrong .
so be prepared to leave those in the car .
but i guess opening the dirt lot to the public is better than nothing .
i have never been so disappointed .
$ _num_ per hour to take photos with the signs !
`` neon '' museum yet none of the signs work !
well , out of all the signs only _num_ worked .
what a disappointment .
-the location is obviously very inconvenient .
way too expensive for what it was !
you will get sun burned .
with what they charge , i wholeheartedly disagree .
not a fan of her 's or the museum overall .
not kidding .
much to my disappointment , that 's not the case .
apparently even on a monday , the tours sell out quickly .
i wish i could give zero starts .
would n't even accommodate for a discount to come back or let us reschedule .
it 's not like we were out there for an hour and did this .
i am thankful for the free ice packs they gave my grandparents .
hell no .
skip this place .
super disappointed .
they just took my money and kicked me out .
horrible customer service .
worst experience ever !
for my birthday a group of _num_ of us wanted to check this out .
i was thinking they could accommodate me and let me go with my group .
wow was i wrong .
so my boyfriend sat out in the car and waited .
they also would n't refund the ticket for me .
no refunds !
the tour is so boring .
it was really really boring .
on april _num_ , _num_ .
sorry to say , i wo n't be shopping this establishment any longer .
my recent purchase was the second time the products have reeked of cat urine !
wo n't bother visiting again the next time i pass through vegas .
however , i will not be going again .
things definitely have changed for the worse .
the cookies did n't have a chance from the beginning .
so bummed and disappointed !
spent around $ _num_ for gifts for home .
they responded that i 'd have to return the product .
no personality !
no one around with a little sample or answers to my questions .
the worst customer service .
she is n't thankful for anyone giving her their business !
she does not smile or give you a `` thank you ! ''
a very disappointed customer from hawaii ... !
for years we have made las vegas our choice for vacation .
my _num_ star is for the old lady behind the counter .
she is n't thankful for anyone giving her their business !
she does not smile or give you a `` thank you ! ''
a very disappointed customer from hawaii ... !
the prices are fair , but the place is getting old .
i made lunch reservations because the wait time was like _num_ and 1/2 hours !
that stupid , rude , obnoxious waiter made my mom cry !
honestly , i 'm not really missing anything .
the place is small and the dealers are pretty rude .
place looks worn .
the bed was hard and obviously old .
at one point i was wondering if the elevator was broken .
would i go back , probably not .
i ca n't believe i stayed here .
big mistake .
even the strip does n't charge for parking !
and it was billed to our room on a nightly basis .
finally , the rooms ... beds are terribly hard and smells of mold .
they need an update badly !
i would definitely not stay here , nor downtown again .
no thanks .
check-in was quick and fairly painless , however our room was less than favorable .
i was n't a fan .
restaurants : ground floor mcdonald 's and a krispy creme .
the room was large , but a bit outdated .
the parking situation is a wreck .
you simply ca n't walk through the casino without smelling like a cigarette .
it 's just not possible .
we would n't stay here again simply due to the location .
i did n't stay here , but we did eat at the cafe .
it is crowded and hot and loud and a drunk group of travelers .
internet service was an extra $ _num_ a day for wifi .
and i did n't have very good cell service inside the hotel .
tv looked about _num_ years old and had limited channels to watch .
so if you like sleep do n't stay here .
our group headed upstairs to the bar and we were ignored by the bartender .
i understand their are rules , but the worker had a rude attitude .
not just any old clothes but very outdated .
apparently they buy it [ like from goodwill ? ]
but they had some really weird clothes .
i went in with my sister , who is a size _num_ in jeans .
it 's a store i wish had better prices , and better staff .
hopefully something similar will pop up in vegas and put them out of business .
i 'm a vintage store snob and i was totally unimpressed with this one .
needless to say , i could n't find a thing to fit my personality .
so lame .
if i wanted that , i would have gone to buffalo exchange .
who does n't like being greeted at the door by a cute kitty ?
_num_ stars for pet store .
_num_ stars for vintage shop .
whenever i travel , i go on a hunt for great vintage shops .
size is not everything , but the selection of items was not that great .
nothing struck my fancy .
i try and buy as much downtown as possible so i know my stuff .
just avoid this place like the plague .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
on my recent trip to vegas , i played _num_ rounds of golf .
this course was my least favorite .
the driving range area was under construction so i went out cold .
the holes are very narrow , and most of them were short .
most holes were being worked on by the grounds crew .
i estimate that at least _num_ holes were under some kind of repair .
after finishing the round , i understand why no one was there .
the beverage girl came around several times , so that was n't an issue .
do not play this course unless you want _num_ hours rounds !
- loud car noise due to freeway and busy streets framing the course .
- the starter was clueless .
when i arrived they told me they were n't going to honor the coupon .
i had driven _num_ miles to play .
unfortunately this is the norm , not an exception .
do n't let them get a hold of your email address .
wish i had not gone there now .
it also almost feels to be more expensive .
a bucket of balls will cost you $ _num_ .
bring your cc as the ball dispenser accepts no cash .
do n't think i will be recommending this place or running back soon .
at the end of our round , we had only used _num_ balls .
sure they were not happy .
but we were disappointed .
did n't want to answer to our questions .
their attitude were bad .
made us feel so uncomfortable .
i felt so terrible and a shame to booked is place to my friends .
so disappointed !
these were awful !
i def will not be patronizing this joint again !
also , i think there prices are a bit inflated .
well , monday rolls around and i do n't get a response .
horrible customer service .
public please be warned this place is terrible !
worst experience ever .
i asked for detail on the costs and he broke them down for me .
i went online to check the price of the part .
i have never questioned a ford parts price from a dealer .
the service department here is staffed by a bunch of crooked liars .
team ford does not deserve anyone 's business .
i dropped off with no problems .
second , paid to have front brake pads replaced .
later , my brother replaced the rear pads for me .
thousands of dollars spent .
i called back two hours later and it still was not ready .
she said they could do the work and i could wait around three hours .
are you kidding me ?
my car was n't even washed !
they state they will wash it if your service is more then $ _num_ .
that 's why it was my last time at team ford .
they have lost mine and my family 's business .
do not get your car serviced here !
then when i told them it was ridiculous they replied it was normal .
they would n't let me even check my car until i paid .
classic bait and switch by your typical scum sales staff !
i would never go back and definitely tell everyone not to go here .
just do some research , i will never go to a dealer again .
completely worthless with incompetent sales staff !
even though i am cleared for work , that is none of his business .
i told them no way in hell will they see that paperwork from me .
this is my worst experience ever with a dealership .
no more leak .
i feel a little nervous now that i did n't get a second opinion .
my bad .
this was also fixed at no cost to me .
the total charge ?
my experience here was pretty ridiculous .
overall ... fuck this place .
my question to them is what the hell do they actually inspect ?
both of these issues could be easily spotted by the most inexperienced mechanic .
are you even checking the tire wear when rotating tires ?
thought checking brakes is part of the _num_ point inspection ?
worst car buying experience ever !
car engine light came on as we were leaving the lot .
still going through hell with this !
_num_ days and still no car back .
ford supposed to pay and pick up car .
what a horrible ordeal !
it happened and in my opinion my experience was awful .
ordeal gladly over .
i left team ford very angry today .
when it was first acting up , we took it in , no problems .
a complete waste of money .
it 's unfortunate that this dealership does n't value their customers more .
$ _num_ and possibly $ _num_ per hour for labor .
ok sure since they asked , why not .
the salesman , mark was then completely disrespectful and rude to me .
how unbelievably rude .
steer clear of this place , it 's a joke .
they do n't want anyone who knows anything about vehicles .
worst of the worst !
does no one understand this is wasting my time and money ?
completely avoid this car and this dealership .
nothing is getting solved .
sometimes the vehicles fail the dealership ... .
they had my car three days and could n't find it .
( _num_ miles ?
do n't trust the service team .
ford quoted $ 1,000 to fix .
i went elsewhere and it was $ _num_ .
these guys are the typical sleazy car salesmen .
avoid this place like the plague .
tip : check the price you agree to with the salesman before signing .
i walk back into the dealership and then wait around .
i then left without buying a car .
ridiculous and dishonest !
the way it was handled was so unprofessional .
they 're in the damn auto biz .
just give me my car back like it was when i dropped it off !
team ford caused me a lot of wasted time getting estimates , and repairs .
this place is only good for people who ca n't afford insurance .
not worthwhile .
i arrived about _num_ minutes prior to my appointment .
after _num_ minutes , nobody had been called back - nobody !
she said there were _num_ people in front of me .
awful awful awful !
made me wait two hours and were nothing but rude the entire time .
almost walked out several times .
visited twice and they got nothing done both times .
i looked at the paper said but those numbers add up to $ _num_ .
the salesman insisted that it was really only $ _num_ .
so adam signed up for all three .
this salesman tells us we owe $ _num_ more than i had planned .
in general , i 'm glad it got resolved .
i told him no that i wanted the original vehicle that i had reserved .
he again told me that he could n't do that .
i know most you do n't go but i will warn you anyhow .
i would not recommend anyone to this place .
they are a scam they are charging _num_ for direct deposit to an account .
there should not be a fee for direct deposit .
i 've been going here for years and never had any issues before .
why would i go back when they were so rude ?
by the way , why does everyone ask `` what for ?
she replied , `` he does n't do primary care . ''
so there you have it , folks .
she said she would call me back but never did .
not a great way to build a practice .
the employee offered no solution other then to call the manager in the morning .
i would not recommend them just for this reason .
this place is ridiculous .
i have been shopping at this bed bath and beyond 4/5 years !
after waiting _num_ plus min .
i also ca n't believe how she decided to treat me like criminal .
very disappointed by this experience ... .
seriously , the hallway was cooler than my room !
_num_ was not going to cut it .
the gambling grounds itself were also a bit lackluster .
apparently you can put whatever you want on the name tags .
the layout of the building was also a bit confusing at first .
my experience with the resort fee , though , will prevent my return .
i do n't like paying for extras i 'll not use .
sams town is past it 's prime and is filthy and dirty and sucks .
uh .
i was disappointed with my stay last night .
we stayed in an outside room on the 7th floor .
the halls and room were dingy and worn .
there was no foam .
it was tolerable .
thank goodness i only stayed _num_ nights .
not worth saving money for the discomfort or inconvenience .
no room service at all either !
apparently only certain people are not allowed to leave the bar with alcohol .
never will i go back except to complain .
if u are working and hate ur job get another one .
we really liked the hotel , but will not ever stay there again .
we probably would not stay here again .
the shower head was coming out of the wall .
there goes the savings .
wrong .
as other reviewers have noted , the price is unbeatable .
at least , the basic room price was a bargain .
i rarely eat beef , but when i do , i like good beef .
stay somewhere else in vegas , come to sam 's town for the buffet .
sam ; s town is just ok .
the buffet was terrible .
even for _num_ the food was terrible .
we would n't go back .
this place is something else and has lost our business .
when booking the room we did advise the room was for a sweet _num_ .
as per the comment from the own below .
staff was rude .
hotel room was ice cold and i found a dead roach behind the toilet .
no tables were open .
like _num_ and they closed _num_ hour early .
this hotel/casino is off the strip and reeks of smoke .
not for me i 'm afraid .
never going there again service sucks !
if you do n't like cigarette smoke , do n't come here !
the workers here are n't very friendly either !
just who the hell do you people think that you are .
do n't even try and go to the sunday brunch .
the wait is _num_ minutes to the hour plus that we waited in line .
it 's not that it 's busy .
how much more trouble can i get into ?
it is obvious that there are issues here .
people occupied the sites we wear assigned .
cheesy .
room was nice but avoid the buffet .
avoid doing special events here .
we just could n't take it anymore .
we felt uncomfortable , upset and generally sick .
very depressing .
the smell is so stinky and obvious .
we were very sick staying at this place , and it ruined our vacation .
what you do n't like you do n't like a lot as well !
slots so tight the scream in pain if they pay .
there is no free here .
no wifi no shuttle no coffee in your room .
they slice it so thin , u ca n't even hardly cut it .
there was no place like a business center to print documents .
the staff was rude when i checked out , and unprofessional .
ok , so check this out .
we just returned to our week stay at sams town today .
the bell hop was rude .
the most disappointing thing about the experience was the hidden charges .
this is a casino who is in the business of taking your money .
they tell me i do n't have enough points .
sam 's town apparently do n't know show respect to its customers especially local .
glad to be only staying _num_ night and never again !
let me start with i have never written a negative review before .
i believe in pointing out the positives in people and companies .
every time i receive some kind of rude and obnoxious response .
this year the prices doubled so i asked for a regular room .
the suites are typically less quality than a normal room at any other hotel .
however today was not so good .
the brunch food was still out , and looked dried up and very old .
the baked potatoes were very old , as well as other food items .
we 've dined here before but never again .
very , very disappointed in food quality and service .
i have my receipt , as well as the charge on my bank card .
the chinese food looked old and disgusting .
we could not find a manager , to even address our concerns with .
same machine is was waiting twice before average time between .
drinks is over _num_ minutes , i hope someone contacts me to discuss .
that was bad !
there was still mildew all underneath the rim .
that was more than i could handle .
she apologized over and over again ( never heard anything from nasty one ) .
there is nothing worse than a liar !
sea food night at sam 's town is not very good .
the options were limited .
no fried sea items beside fish .
i am not a fish lover , so i did not test .
the brown gravy however is disgusting .
the mac and cheese looks tasty , but taste like powder .
waitress did not come around often to ask for refills .
when we arrived , we were greatly disappointed .
id '' like , who the heck talks like that ?
the only thing that sucked was our view and the extremely clogged sink .
okay do you eat with your damn hands ?
it 's not that difficult !
i also wo n't recommend this hotel to anyone especially if you 're younger .
it 's not worth it !
it 's lacking way too much now .
your jackpot would be staying away from here .
rooms are rather older - needs a major renovation .
this hotel has no real unique amenities to justify this .
what a disappointment .
is n't breakfast supposed to be the super cheap meal at a casino ?
without a player 's card it is over $ _num_ .
staff is unhappy slots are very bad .
no good , no choice , no people .
this establishment deserves no stars .
terrible travel experience .
i have been traveling for more than _num_ years .
never have i experienced such incompetence .
restaurants service and food was below poor .
you wo n't see me again .
staff is unhappy slots are very bad .
no good , no choice , no people .
no good ... ... ... .
how totally clueless !
the first time nothing stands out , kinda boring , but no complaints .
spending new years eve at sams town for _num_ old school party was horrible !
by the time we got in there was no seats .
they ran out of hats & service was horrible .
one star is for the movie theater , it 's super empty !
me and my fianc were the only two in the room .
pros : beds are comfy , big bathrooms , movie theater !
the attitude ?
appalling that valet workers did not see this ?
very disappointed with the state of the rooms .
never again are we going to sams town .
not impressed .
the staff were overwhelmed and rude .
they could n't even put our group in two lanes next to each other .
this place is a no from me .
will not revisit .
what a horrible experience !
i can not even begin to describe how terrible my stay was .
situation handled .
- now , if this were the only thing , no big deal .
here 's the kicker ( _num_ . )
he says , `` so this only happened twice ? ''
he was incredibly condescending and rude .
for this reason , i will never stay at sam 's town again .
my friend and i with my husband who is disabled stayed here in march .
i was so disappointed with the place that i will not stay there again .
not good either .
i know i will never , ever being going there again .
guest wifi is virtually none existent in the rv park where we stayed .
there is a bit of noise from the airport but not to bad .
i will not even give this place a review .
i am sick with this establishment .
nasty ass place .
this is ridiculous .
this is ridiculous .
then i called a week ago to add an extra night .
they were incredibly rude and did absolutely nothing to try to fix the problem .
this place does not honor their reservations .
the worst experience of my life .
very rude and inconsiderate .
told me he will give me a room with a pull out bed .
was so uncomfortable .
stay the hell away .
their security and management sucks .
my mother gets a _num_ dollar comp for her birthday .
not crowded on a thursday evening .
tell waiter - _num_ percent discount .
no visit from cook or manager .
i wish i could give this casino _num_ stars .
worst experience ever in any casino .
after _num_ hours barely saw _num_ of them .
sams town is the worst casino to play crap table at !
this store is run by a bunch of teenagers with zero customer service .
will not be returning to this store .
it was such a shame because i really loved this store .
do n't waste your time !
they talked us into staying last time but this is it !
she , in my opinion , needs a a lesson in customer service .
they wo n't remember you or your animal , ever .
apparently it never gets in cause they never call back .
just ridiculous .
in addition they did not have any health insurance plans .
needed dental care for more than my dog .
the monthly plan paid only for the actual office visit , so not much .
he said come back and they would do it and not charge .
i asked the doctor how this could be .
i get it ... medicine is not an exact science .
still , no call from the owner .
i will never return nor recommend anyone going there .
also , valle verde animal hospital lied to me .
not one person that worked there told us where to stand .
so we ended up just standing in a corner .
he never looked at me , acknowledged me , introduced himself or anything .
they were n't being really loud , they were just happy for us .
to be with us and got treated so bad .
it was very disappointing , and i felt so bad for my family .
so sorry that shit happened on my vacation that also required cash .
these margaritas were awful .
no one at our table finished a glass .
i understand that this can be difficult for small restaurants .
however , when we arrived , there was only one other table occupied .
other people at my table got the wrong food , too .
the service here was awful .
too bad , cause the food is good .
the food was nothing special .
not here .
this is the one food area where las vegas is really lacking .
guess i 'll avoid for a while .
well it was clean and the food quality was ok , but very bland .
possibly the worst mojito i 've ever had .
not even worth a second chance .
gets the second star for the cheesy spanish language videos .
i was excited to get me one of them cuban sandwiches .
the bread was nothing to write home about , but it was ok .
the lady then gave me $ _num_ .
the actual price was $ _num_ .
check your bill before paying .
so i am sitting waiting until my friends food comes so i can eat .
disappointment for me as even the rice and beans were bland , very bland !
literally had a plate of wasted meat left .
she probably should have sent it back as was basically inedible .
service and food very disappointing .
we will not be back .
it was ridiculous how loud it was .
this place sucks balls ... and not the good kind !
so we just ate the appetizers .
also , the waitresses are quite surly .
the food leaves something to be desired as well .
the bread for the cuban sandwich was very dry and very flaky .
horrible , bad do n't eat here .
we ended up running for our lives out of here .
chimichangas were hard as a rock .
chips & salsa was free .
service is eh & the decor is dreadful .
downtown has some good spot , this is not one of them .
so not having real sugar on the table was something i did n't like .
if i was on fremont street and hungry i might come back here again .
they take slow to a whole other place and it 's not good .
_num_ stars : it 's just not all that .
horrible service !
waited _num_ min for the waitress and it was n't even busy .
i had a terrible experience at this restaurant .
services : terrible !
it 's cheap food and you do n't care what it tastes like .
you 're wasted .
oh my god , what a shitty piece of pizza .
this is a tourist trap .
crap .
pure and utter crap .
worst pizza ever ... .
i decided to try this one out ... big big mistake .
the pizza was a big soggy doughy mess with almost no cheese or toppings .
ended up throwing most of it away .
if other pizza places are open id avoid this one .
it was late , and i was starving .
was on fremont and was desperately looking for a food joint .
spent over $ _num_ for it !
no where near worth it .
not even worth half that amount .
first mistake : they cook it in a pan .
its a cheap pizza by the slice type place .
trust me , this joint was empty for good reason .
this place is just awful .
they could n't even get my diet coke right .
how very disappointing .
do yourself a favor folks , skip this joint .
it 's a waste of calories !
this was some of the worst pizza i 've had in vegas .
it was dry .
i 've had frozen pizza that taste better than this !
do n't bother getting the $ _num_ two slice special .
mediocre tasting pizza .
horrible horrible horrible customer service .
for $ _num_ for a _num_ '' pepperoni pizza you can do better .
do n't come here just because your walking the strip .
do not go here if you want some pizza and a cup of water .
i could n't believe how rude their staff was .
do not ever visit this place .
unless you were a man , then the helped you .
i would not even give _num_ star .
this place messed up my order and blame me for the mistake .
overpriced for a bland buffet with stale desserts in a crappy area of vegas .
i mean , c'mon , fried chicken ?
the drinks were really bad .
service was fine , but everything else sucked .
i went there based on yelp 's reviews and truly wish i did n't .
it just does n't look normal ... at which point i gave up .
the place heavily reeked of pot .
i walked out and the other person who was behind me also walked out .
the customer service sucks the atmosphere is a run down hole in the wall .
ceiling fan , broke holes in the wall .
i 'm pretty torn giving a poor rating like this .
never the f again .
another dude walks over asks if i have a barber yet ?
i walked out .
i feel bad tho .
the owner followed me out to try and make the situation better .
truly went off .
sorry owner dude .
most uncomfortable situation you can imagine .
bald fade didnt come out clean at all .
wo n't be back .
this place tries spin that `` classic barbershop '' nonsense .
not to mention , they advertise prices like $ _num_ for a haircut online .
however , dude charged me $ _num_ for my haircut .
went in on a friday afternoon around _num_ .
seemed like i was an inconvenience to him the whole time .
no customer service .
crappy cut .
wo n't be back .
visiting vegas $ _num_ ride uber both to and from this barbershop .
the $ _num_ line up i got was n't .
$ _num_ for a line up and the shop is n't even nice .
not a fan !
a week later the watch was losing time .
ill never take a watch there again , id rather do it myself .
my very first impression of the business is their lack of upfront pricing .
which under my impression he said _num_ minutes .
i went there today to have a necklace extended by _num_ links .
the repair guy was just sitting there doing nothing anyway .
this place is a rip off .
another jeweler in the mall did it for free .
went there to get my stone on my wedding band replaced .
because they never fixed it because the stone did n't come in .
i have them an entire week and she said it would be done .
the blonde , uninterested woman behind the counter asked how she could help us .
i told her about the link , she said $ _num_ .
`` it probably is n't even worth fixing at that price '' she said .
so we left and yelped some other places .
charge what you want , but at least act like you care .
an older gentleman made a mistake ringing me up .
i said ok ... you are having a bad day .
no apology .
i received no bag for my watches and only received attitude .
this company is the worst .
they should be put out of business for fraud .
you will never see a dollar of your security deposit back .
there is not one redeeming quality about them .
i must have called _num_ times and had my husband call .
no one returned my calls .
their voice mail and website say they will contact you within _num_ hours .
clearly , that is a lie .
not even worth a star .
judy , we are highly educated and responsible people .
none of your clients said anything positive about you or your business .
the house is literally falling apart .
mediocre is far better the atrocious .
no '' i apologize '' or any kind of explanation for the slow response .
just search online there are better places to spend your money .
do n't worry be happy .
i did n't receive _num_ smile from this lady .
the whole time i was there i just wanted to leave .
it was n't all that great .
the cheesy salsa was bomb.com it was a spicy salsa with cheese melted inside .
$ _num_ for a canned soda because they do n't have fountain drinks .
i would n't recommend this places at all .
hair in our food from the beginning there was zero customer service .
are u effing kidding me ?
she did say sorry and quickly took the plate and never returned .
not even to offer a discount .
just horrible service .
chicken enchiladas were nothing special .
the chips were odd tasting and the salsa was very spicy .
my wife is a wedding photographer , so this really annoyed us .
`` no .
edit - more than two months have gone by and still no dvd .
anyway , no response .
took my _num_ year old daughter here for trouble breathing .
no stars .
if you value your property rent elsewhere .
it was so loud .
i did n't particularly like the food either .
for some reason , i thought the dish would be different .
so the dish somewhat threw me off .
tables came in after us and left before us repeatedly .
it 's a shame how great i thought of this place .
nobody speaks a lick of english ?
as long as the food tastes good and i do n't get sick !
when i walked in , i thought the ambience was decent .
i ordered a corona and was disappointed that the beer was n't that cold .
for $ _num_ it was a bargain .
a bowl that was filled with everything but the kitchen sink .
nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations .
i wo n't be back .
let down , especially when compared to another mexican restaurant real close by .
there was very little flavor to it .
the steak fajitas tasted ok .
they were served with _num_ small tortillas , we had to ask for more .
it just tasted like a little tomato juice with beer .
it did not even have a lime with it .
then she put her hand out and demanded a tip .
she repeated herself _num_ times .
too many other options for good mexican food around .
it was our first time here and we were pretty disappointed .
service was good but the food was very bland .
and _num_ shrimp and octopus cocktails .
a no go for me never again .
after _num_ tries it still does not work .
_num_ percent automated phone system .
bad service , bad , bad .
yeah , the tour might be great , but the product is horrible .
i 've only used _num_ cups !
i hate when a substandard company costs me money .
it has been a staple of mine for many years .
what a disappointment .
the new container is terrible .
but now i 'm guessing probably not .
that is why it tasted different .
big mistake !
we left there feeling uncomfortable .
they also tested our _num_ batteries .
it took them _num_ hours in labor & the whole bill was $ _num_ .
i 'm treated horribly and talk to you like if you know nothing .
they are rude and put you on hold when ever they feel like it .
super poor customer service .
attempted to get an appointment .
no problem , we will be there in _num_ hours .
drive _num_ hours to la .
need serious training in customer service .
horrible place !
waste more time waiting in line because they ca n't staff accordingly .
these people do n't care there is a line .
he was rude and pushy .
we actually started yelling back and forth at one point .
i just shake my head in disappointment , and walk away .
this is the slowest and most inefficient bank i have ever been to .
when they open they only have one teller available to help customers .
the longest lines and they charge you a fee for everything .
from the wait time to management , the whole experience was a nightmare .
will be looking into moving my money asap and all because of this experience .
because if they did , they would have easily ripped this place .
the carne asada was salty and i 've made better carnitas in the oven .
i had the $ _num_ chicken tacos , and they were atrocious .
they mask some horrible food with cheap prices .
same awful taste _num_ times in a row .
will not go again .
my boyfriend started saying how his chicken tacos tasted bland and way too greasy .
i was beyond livid and starving .
i want the entire thing and it became about the principle by then !
of course more attitude followed .
i totally lost my appetite and just said forget it .
what makes this worse is i contacted the company with no response .
terrible , i should of read all the reviews first .
did n't even ask they just took it out .
worst location in town .
several bad experiences here , but tonight was the worst .
at least i did n't have a chance to pay , i suppose .
again , this is simply unacceptable .
if i had a choice , i would go elsewhere .
the receptionist stated that i did not have an appointment .
last year my appointment time was changed _num_ times without explanation or warning .
i missed over _num_ hours of work because of this .
customer service and scheduling all bad !
if you have a choice please avoid this place at all costs .
no stars .
i drove up with my husband and saw only a receptionist .
clearly that was not me .
beginning with making the appointment is where it all went wrong .
so she says i will have to reschedule .
after she asked to collect $ _num_ from me but i was short .
so she said , `` do n't you want to reschedule ? ''
they called my doctor and told them i walked out on my ultrasound .
it is not as though i were showing up with my pets !
this is a common complaint at all locations so why not correct it ?
i am not a real big fan of fast-food type coffee houses .
the last _num_ times i 've been there it 's a total nightmare .
slow service .
they do n't pay attention .
dont have time to stop here .
there is no kids play area .
quite possibly one of the unprofessional baseball organization i 've visited .
lines were also slow .
wo n't return to watch this team next time i return to vegas .
so far l 've had a very bad experience just trying to be seen .
fax is impossible to get through .
very negative experience .
he literally rushed me out of the room .
as he was rushing me out .
the receptionist was even rude .
i wo n't be stepping foot into specialized pain management ever again .
one of the worst experiences i have ever had .
was talked down to .
made to feel like i was not a valued patient .
was told that the negative reviews were patients that were not given drugs .
this doctor is a complete joke .
one of the worst experiences i have ever had .
was talked down to .
made to feel like i was not a valued patient .
was told that the negative reviews were patients that were not given drugs .
a day later and it still hurts to speak .
i really really wanted to like this office and am sorely disappointed .
i do not recommend this place .
i gave them _num_ chances , both times they were unprofessional and unorganized .
wrong !
both of those girls are plain rude .
she emailed me a quote for auto insurance on the 5th day .
i could not believe that i had been downright lied to !
what a waste !
worst service ever !
how does anyone run a business like this .
i will never rent from thrifty again .
i was there almost _num_ hours standing in line .
we waited _num_ minutes to reach an agent .
for the record , their price was $ _num_ per gallon .
not a rotation .
_num_ ) i was quoted , on line , $ _num_ .
_num_ days @ $ _num_ per day .
grand total = $ _num_ .
long waits , agents take very long , never , ever again .
customer service at counter sucked !
does not matter if you have a reservation .
decent hair cut ( for dogs ) , but a little expensive .
i was a little irritated , but the dog did n't seem to care .
_num_ stars from my experience , but i will say other folks like them .
she proceeded to say my dog 's injury was in fact my fault .
she never apologized for the injury either .
quote , `` it took so long '' .
they ca n't handle anything more than that .
also , their price list is wrong .
anyhow , my friends ' experiences were not that great .
the girl in the back was helpful , but she ai n't the manager .
she could n't even look at us .
what 's worse , she was the concierge !
it was lame .
oh and uh the spa facilities suck too btw .
he is bomb !
nothing was special about this place .
no thanks .
( which are in no way gold plated ) annoying .
no thanks .
it was like the pedi of shame .
they say , we automatically charge a _num_ % gratuity .
where do you get off deciding how much i give for gratuity ?
had a massage here and had such high hopes ... but was let down .
sooooo annoying .
( ummm , no ) .
unfortunately , that experience did n't happen this time around .
the spa itself has significantly gone downhill .
hmm ... does n't juice cost more than water ?
it almost feels like the sink area at your local gym .
you know , kind of stale and industrial feeling .
do not waste your time and money in this place .
and it is very expensive ( $ _num_ for a _num_ min ) .
plus the building needs some major upgrades and needs to get current !
i was more than dissapointed .
this spa was awful from the moment i walked in .
i did n't make it more than _num_ seconds in there .
i got really pissed at this point and ran out of there .
you can find a better place .
kind of pathetic .
the bathrooms are not clean .
the atmosphere does not feel spa like at all .
i showed up _num_ minutes early .
wan na drop a quick $ _num_ for _num_ mediocre mani/pedi 's ?
ok what is that ?
find your way to another spa .
this ai n't the one to spend your afternoon , or your money .
i was not impressed by my experience here .
on a side note , the restrooms were dirty and clogged !
i was n't very impressed .
did n't hit up the sauna so i 'm not sure how that was .
felt dark and dingy though .
wish i brought my workout gear though .
it 's generally an ok spa , not great .
ps , .
this review is for the salon only .
very dingy , dated salon .
poor lighting .
the massage was ok , but everything else was n't .
go somewhere else , you can get so much more for the money !
no problems there .
she also did n't have me wash my hands after filing .
no hand massage at all .
a real disappointment .
i sat down and the heat instantly burned the inside of my nose .
i ran out and the door handle was so hot it burned my hand .
she stated she told the manager and maintenance was on there way .
there was no apology or concern for my well being .
however , i am not sue happy and just wanted good customer service .
$ _num_ + mandatory $ _num_ tip .
horrible job .
the front desk lady was nice but would n't show me the spa .
and it looked like it needed a good vacuuming .
their hot tub had some green questionable foam in the corners of the tub .
that did n't happen either cause it was just not inviting .
i left there so disappointed and not relaxed at all .
i guess that one spoiled me forever .
it was hot enough for me .
there is also dry sauna and steam sauna .
there is also cold water jacuzzi but did not try it .
customer server guy in spa was kind .
i had an awful experience .
dry sauna not hot and steam sauna dirty with mud on the floor !
she changed her mind _num_ times to give me the refund .
do n't get the chi foot massage .
i spent $ _num_ for someone to rub my feet .
it was terrible .
no skills .
after this visit , not again .
the spa at paris , is the worst place i have ever seen .
the facilities are horrible .
the attendant frankly lazy and rude .
do not waste a penny .
i called the spa and left a message to see if they had appointments .
nobody called me back .
that was not an option .
she said , oh , that should n't have happened .
i asked to see the policy , but she could not find it .
that is a poor business model .
do n't be surprised at the lack of customer service .
poor customer service at front desk .
i guess brittany did n't read the groupon herself .
too bad the front desk ruined the whole thing .
although the masseuse was very good at the spa the facilities were not clean !
my locker had trash inside it , and the steam room was broken .
the jacuzzi tub looked gross , and every shower had hair in the drain .
the room was cold and so were my therapists hands .
the heated massage table saved me , even though it was kind of small .
it was hard to relax .
i would n't come back , not even for the groupon price .
i got a groupon , which is why i went .
it 's small , not very clean , and not worth it .
i was very disappointed .
it feels more like a gym locker room .
i had to tell him about _num_ times it was too much pressure .
their employees do n't pay attention to what they do .
i filed the claim but they just ignored it .
they did n't even answer me after i emailed them couple of times .
the facilities were outdated and some areas dirty .
this last time was extremely strange to say the least .
i never received a call or any explanation for them for ignoring my concern .
extremely disappointing !
so not worth it .
spend your money on a show instead .
she stayed at paris , so we chose this spa for the convenience .
the hot tub area was actually dirty .
the treatment rooms were clean and the staff was professional .
only _num_ minutes , but still not correct .
i lost my zen the minute i checked in .
the worst part was how dirty the common areas were .
this place is in desperate need of repair .
in the condition it was , it should 've been shut down for maintenance .
overall , not worth the price paid .
spas are premium , luxury purchases and the whole experience should reflect as such .
will not go back !
i tried to cancel massage appt that was made for me by a friend .
i was _num_ mins .
then she tells me that i 'm booked for _num_ minutes instead of _num_ .
again , no let me see what i can do .
so i try to make the most out of the situation again .
it was n't bad but it was n't the best either .
that was not the case this time .
you ca n't even tip according to how you felt the service went .
the service was blah and none of my knots were taken out .
my husband and i were desperately in need of some relaxation .
omg , reminder of the pure disappointment i had just lived through .
btw they do not mention the added gratuity at check in !
i walk in to an empty , non staffed lounge .
wait , then this young lady pops out from the office .
she checks me in and shows me around .
i get my locker .
after my massage , i went to put my clothes back on .
then i noticed the disgusting carpet floor in the locker room .
there is no professionalism .
dirty , disgusting , ripoff .
this is not a place for that .
it is a huge rip off .
the massage lacked the main thing i told her i needed work on .
the front desk registration was horrible .
that was another good _num_ minutes of lying there doing nothing .
so we are down to _num_ minutes .
i refused .
if i could i wouldnt even put a star .
i would make them a negative .
avoid this place .
i asked for his name but he just turned his head and ignored me .
i 've never been treated so rudely by a service staff member before .
if you hate your job go work somewhere else asshole !
avoid this company and any properties managed by it like the plague .
management does not care about residents at all .
avoid at all costs .
this is a horrible company .
her superior and arrogant attitude was too much .
this management company has a long way to go to being respected .
a rating of _num_ is one too many .
would give them no stars if possible .
do n't do business with these people !
if i could give no stars i would this is the worst subway ever .
the employees are told to not give out water cups to paying customers .
greedy business owners like this are have got to go .
unfortunately , i 'm so disappointed .
did n't look anything like the pic i showed him i wanted .
they have the most rude manager ever !
las vegas is stuck in _num_ .
well , i think i 'll stick with taco bell .
this is n't my place to go .
first off had a horrible experience at this location .
it was n't even supposed to be locked inside .
every single one is soooo sloppy and soggy and just disgusting to touch .
sure , tacos should be fun and messy .
this is just awful .
lol super rude and horrible customer service .
nope , i wo n't be back !
parking sucks , sorry guys !
she must either hate her job or was having a bad day .
so sorry for her but very low standards for starbucks employees .
never happened to me at starbucks before .
i will not be visiting this location .
i do n't have time to demand another one .
but ... what the hell .
i figured i 'm here so i 'll play .
i pushed the button for a refill .
frankly , i think she might be management or the owner .
too bad the food was n't very good .
we say `` what the hell , it ca n't be that bad ! ''
nasty pho , not enough meat , bad broth !
spring rolls were nasty and service lacked .
off the beaten path so do n't go looking for this place .
avoid at all costs !
we walk into the restaurant and it 's dead .
there are two boys who look bored out of their mind .
he looked like he was _num_ !
my friends ordered the large pho with rare steak .
i did not like the pho at all .
it seemed so bland and gross .
i just ate it because i was super hungry .
the eggrolls only came with lettuce .
our experience was that bad .
we happened upon this place and we thought how bad could it be ?
people ca n't really mess up pho that bad .
it was n't even cheap .
i know other reviews have said this place is a cheap eat .
that was not my experience .
i would n't mind paying a couple bucks more if it were good .
but it was absolutely appalling .
we finally left the place disappointed , disgusted and hungry .
the place is dirty , with _num_ lights working .
there were tables full of dirty dishes .
even then we did n't get anything to drink until we finished our meal .
if i could give this a negative star i would .
i did n't want to speak on something i had no knowledge of .
the egg rolls were average at best .
avoid this place like a plague .
sure no problem .
the dish came and looked mighty pathetic for _num_ .
tried the fish sauce first , wasnt made too well .
this tasted like fish sauce with water .
garbage bin was overflowing with paper ... toilet paper to be exact .
why is the garbage bin overflowing with toilet paper ?
before i could even see who it actually was she was already walking back .
the portion was pathetic .
i had a large bowl of pho tai and it was filling .
it tasted okay ... not the best , but not the worst .
the other items are not cheap and not good either .
worst restaurant i 've ever been in !
came in on a hot afternoon , the place has no ac .
the whole restaurants looks old and dirty .
the food taste mediocre .
the thai tea i ordered was sour !
the owner never once apologize or offer a refund .
stay far and far away of this place !
first off , the lady working there was not too happy today i think .
this tasted more like rubber .
i could barely chew the _num_ pieces i forced down .
they do n't care about cause youre just a tourist to them .
this place was no good .
the food was n't good .
the customer service was n't good either .
do n't support their business .
there prices are great but their service is horrible !
they do n't even deserve a tip because their customer service is so horrible .
vegas local and love taco bell but this one sucks so bad .
disaster .
i was wanting to get my nails done .
after tip total paid was $ _num_ .
acrylic nails usually last about _num_ weeks or so before they begin lifting .
needless to say i will not be returning .
however , she stained my dress with the oil .
they refused at first , but then agreed .
while the services done were done well , customer service was lacking .
just kidding , not fine .
over fifty dollars ?
do not expect good service at this place .
avoid it at all costs .
just do n't do it .
he completely ignored me while i was standing in line .
i went right down the street to pep boys and gave them my money .
this guy must have forgotten all the competition that he has around him .
my third and last visit _num_ stars .
no more !
not going to waste my hard earned money on such poor food and quality .
only had one visit that was good as described in my first review .
done done done with below standard food and funky shitty bad attitude filled service .
i gave this place two chances and they failed me .
i was more than fair .
pics attached , looks are deceiving !
i was disappointed yet again !
but their was barely any beef !
in the meantime , my ordered was delivered .
i was soooo disappointed .
there was absolutely no flavor in any of the items ordered .
buyers beware !
its not bad , but its just not very good .
all across the board its just lacking .
i ordered chicken and broccoli very spicy and chicken with mixed veggies .
hot and sour soup did n't even have tofu in it .
my chicken fried rice was bland !
do n't order from them !
i wish i had known this was a `` fast food '' chinese place .
it looked pretty dingy and sad .
it was pretty hot though , even when i tried to cool it down .
it was too tangy and greasy here .
it was not appetizing to eat it at all .
i did n't finish the chicken .
i wish i had gotten the steamed rice instead .
i ate it , but i did not enjoy it at all .
it was strange for my mouth , but it was n't bad per say .
it was n't very good either .
i do n't see how they can live with themselves serving those plates .
i would have rather gone to panda express .
not really .
the appearance of the place matches the food ... cheap and unappetizing .
they do not want return customers .
looks like it is time to find new chinese restaurant .
their food is really bland , no flavor at all !
overpriced for tasteless food !
a whole in the wall place with tasteless food !
not my favorite type of hole-in-the-wall chinese food that i like .
maybe it was because it was delivered and not eaten at the restaurant ?
it just was n't that great to me .
it was n't bad , but it was n't stellar either .
so much chewing , so little flavor .
i live a little over a minute away .
some other reviews said that this place is inconsistent .
waste of money .
absolutely no cream cheese in them at all .
i also ordered bbq pork and beef & broccoli both mediocre at best .
its ok because we are never wasting our money here again .
even if the customer service was excellent i wouldnt come back .
i could get better tasting chinese for the same price .
after reading the reviews i was skeptical but gave it a shot anyways .
lo mien was not too bad .
as far as the curry chicken goes i was n't pleased at all .
waaaay too much sauce with very little flavor and was also cold .
i tried the shrimp with vegetables and bbq spare ribs .
the ribs had mostly fat and were just ok .
i was disappointed this time .
only the egg rolls were good .
both other dishes were exceptionally bland .
las vegas , nevada sales tax is : _num_ % .
she charges you _num_ % + .
gave them $ _num_ including tip .
orange chicken : chicken undercooked .
spend your money at panda express .
the food is cheap here but would you rather feel disgusted after ?
thank you mike and dan for helping me get this resolved .
_num_ rating .
cheapest item with tax was almost $ _num_ .
nothing on the sign advertising it said that a purchase was necessary .
crappy service and crappy pizza with barely any toppings , we ordered ahead .
the expectation is for cheap and fast pizza .
expecting good pizza from little caesars is expecting more than they can deliver .
they are incredibly disorganized and the customer service is severely lacking in every regard .
there are never any _num_ meat or supreme `` hot & ready '' pizzas .
bad location .
the lady told me it was going to be another _num_ minutes .
i 'm still here waiting over _num_ minutes .
the lady told me it was going to be another _num_ minutes .
i 'm still here waiting over _num_ minutes .
yesterday was the worst .
he acts like i 'm not speaking english !
sounds like false advertising to me .
what is wrong with you people !
now i see why u guys have so bad reviews !
this is unacceptable
if i could give negative stars to this place i absolutely would .
their customer service is awful .
i arrived _num_ minutes later and they did n't even have my order .
boxes that were pre-made and ready to have pizzas and breads put into them .
which , if you did n't know , is a huge safety concern .
worst customer service ever !
stay away from this unfriendly place !
i had to throw the pizza away it tasted so bad .
they told me there is no way for them to do it .
it looked like high school in between classes in there .
the breast meat was fairly dry .
the worst jamaican food ever , pricey and run down .
the staff does not care one bit .
over priced and not clean .
i had the oxtail and it was n't seasoned well .
my boyfriend liked his jerk chicken , rice and peas were a little hard .
the floors were disgusting and the plastic tables clothes were faded and had holes .
i 'm not planning on eating here again .
too bad the food is disgusting and the place is filthy .
will not be back .
the coupon nor the restaurant advised that this was take out only .
they are way too expensive and i will not be returning .
apparently there are _num_ names in play here .
what normally would be a deli case is filled with boxes as you enter .
no menu provided , no service to the table .
at several points , nobody was present for service of any sort .
the menu states all meals are served with peas - not true .
none was provided .
we had a $ _num_ dollar restaurant.com gift certificate .
what should have cost us around $ _num_ , cost us $ _num_ .
ordered patty and coco bread horrible is all i can say .
there was also rum cake , it was just okay .
it was a waste of time and money going to this place .
not sure how others rated this place _num_ stars but to each there own .
my taste buds was not wow 'd .
i expected more for the price i paid .
but the food , despite smelling so good , was simply mediocre .
the jerk chicken was , for starters , dry .
when even your sides are underwhelming , there 's a problem in the kitchen .
expensive and not that good .
the food is kind of bland .
being jamaican myself they could do so much better .
will not be going back unless it 's for something they do n't cook .
i was not impressed at all .
$ _num_ `` refund '' is pathetic .
too bad , flavors were n't bad once `` reheated . ''
horrible experience overall .
`` ding '' come from the kitchen .
this is the most flavorless jamaican food i have ever eaten .
there was a small disclaimer that bothered me .
i also ordered a slice of rum cake which was listed at $ _num_ .
not very nice though .
the chicken was dry and bland .
not worth the $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
it did n't taste like authentic jamaican food .
she then put the patty and coco bread in the darn microwave .
being jamaican , i 'm really disappointed .
i was so disappointed .
i grew up on this food and never , ever experienced food like this .
the rice and beans were very dry .
it was like it had been in the warmer since the day before .
a waste of $ _num_ dollars !
i would n't even feed this crap to my dog .
i ca n't even rate this a _num_ star !
this place i will give a _num_ star .
i 've herb _num_ time , tried something different every time , not thrilled .
let 's just say you definitely would n't come here for great service .
the only people who seemed to get good service were the regulars .
i probably wo n't be going back .
i gave _num_ stars because the ginger beer was amazing .
the food is just ok .
plus they are cheap cheap with their meat .
not worth the money .
i mean really attitude .
i suppose it 'd make me miserable too .
the people running it acted like they could care less that i stopped in .
all the food did n't taste fresh unfortunately .
too bad , i was hoping it would be a good place .
very rude !
and walked to the back as i was speaking .
i 'll take my money where my business is appreciated !
she is not professional and very rude .
well , i am so disappointed of the quality and the price .
sadly , many of the flowers are not fresh either .
oh shit !
maybe so for someone who is brain dead .
find another florist , these people are dishonest .
worst customer service in the history of the world .
their prices are ridiculous , hidden fees and charges .
poor quality of flowers .
their stuff are rude .
they have the worst customer service ever .
i ordered _num_ roses for my friend .
turned out , the flowers are ugly .
services are worst .
if i could give it less than one star i would .
awful customer service .
their staff is extremely rude .
anyhow ... i was pretty disappointed .
the spring rolls were huge but too peppery .
ick .
ick .
i did n't know about free refills since we got it to go .
lots of food for the money , but quality is ick .
you have been warned .
the yellow curry was pretty bland .
the curry sauce was watery , which i normally like .
also , the portion of chicken was nicely sized .
there were a couple of thinly sliced peppers though that were pretty skimpy .
the service was friendly , but a little slow .
the soggy noodles were just gross .
i have got to stop letting a coworker talk me into stuff .
reasonable waitress kindly asking to order i took my chance with the soup first .
i was very disappointed with thai bbq .
food taste is horrible and never go back .
easily the worst thai food i 've ever had .
even the thai beef salad was like eating air .
avoid this place at all costs .
i 'm disappointed .
we had shrimp fried rice and chicken coconut soup .
the soup was bland .
the rice had too many onions and chunks of tomato .
the worst thai bbq i 've had .
there portion was so small .
everything we ate was like bad .
_num_ star was for their staff they were nice & friendly .
you can tell it was not freshly cooked .
i thought i would give this place another try and it 's still disappointing .
left a bad taste .
which i refused and then they just disappeared .
they did remove $ _num_ off my bill .
as we were seated and about to order our server was rude .
she seemed to grow impatient with me so i just ordered a salad .
their food is n't anything special .
but no the server refused and i asked when did this rule start ?
such a disappointment .
been going to this place for _num_ years and today was a major disappointment .
had them take it back and then brought another wrong one .
they 've lost a consistent and loyal customer .
added an extra $ _num_ on to my bill for no reason !
overall , okay food , nothing special .
the car was there _num_ days .
to make a long story short , we get the car back .
dead alternator .
_num_ in labor ... really ?
it 's not really located in the best area .
i 'm happy the chit hole shut down .
they put a plastic bag over it where it remained for years .
had n't been cleaned in years .
my first experience with these guys was about a year ago .
rather than being greeted , i hear `` we 're closed !
oh no you did not just yell at me .
fast forward to _num_ days ago .
... ok ... but your window says same day .
it had n't been touched yet .
ok again ... not a huge deal .
do you not know your own hours ?
and i was told this morning that it would be ready tonight . ''
me ... '' no , sorry . ''
and next time , do n't laugh at your customer for asking .
there is never an excuse for rude service .
wo n't be ordering again .
lots of better competition to choose from too .
i 'm not cheap , but $ _num_ for plain grilled cheese ?
sandwiches were big , but bland and lacking in flavor .
will not go again , do not recomend .
this was horrible .
i 've never waited _num_ minutes for a stupid sandwich !
i will not be returning to this location .
that said , i will not return to this location again .
the only reason i gave this location _num_ stars was the food itself .
i ordered a cheesesteak and it barely had meat on it .
i payed $ _num_ with tax .
extremely bad attitude !
avoid at all cost !
repair person comes , looks at door , says he can fix .
never called back but sent a bill for over $ _num_ .
they advertise `` free estimates '' but nope , that 's not true .
terrible !
two guys came and had no clue .
now it is fine after _num_ minutes of my doing it right .
avoid this company like the plague .
i am very disappointed .
save for people begging for money .
probably too much for my own good .
in no business is this okay .
quit if you ca n't work it !
why does it take _num_ minutes to make small curly fries ?
disappointing almost every time the order is wrong .
ordered _num_ breakfast combos they forgot both hash browns .
then we got home and the grande sausage burrito had no sausage !
i recently had my oil changed at auto tech .
i 'm so glad that i got a second opinion !
that 's careless work - unacceptable .
it was only _num_ $ , its not a lot of money .
but the amount of money lost for future business is .
its to bad too .
i would n't have posted this review if it was the truth .
i will not go back there again .
i would not ever advise anyone to bring thier car here , ever !
that is when things turned ugly quick .
_num_ ) the groupon includes a tire rotation .
i am usually not one to complain , but seriously ... stay away .
did the cheap groupon oil deal , was not satisfied .
they also did not check my a/c like promised in the deal .
i just called them and was put on hold for _num_ minutes .
i called them back and no one answered .
very disappointed with service i received here .
i do n't believe i will return there again .
i just do n't understand how come we could n't have both ?
terrible , when you consider that you want a comfortable theater experience .
not that comfortable but that 's just my preference .
unfortunately , with no comfortable arm rest .
reviewers should all be focused on the atmosphere , cleanliness , and service .
$ _num_ for a large soda & no refill !
no sign either ?
in case you have n't noticed refills are the industry norm .
worse experience ever !
the supervisor was very rude and condescending !
will never come back to this place again .
one thing i did n't like ?
the fact that the air was on low or nonexistent most of the movie .
why ca n't we stroll around while waiting for the movie to start .
i can not recommend this clinic .
i feel like american pet hospital is trying to jiffy me .
then i waited in an exam room for a very long time .
the first couple times , the front desk girls were remotely pleasant .
the negative attitude was too much this time .
just pay your damn bill here . ''
cut was n't done .
he finally called back after _num_ days of messages left with receptionist .
my pet has always been healthy and no health problems till this incident .
it 's now closed , sadly .
guess , what kind of discount i got ?
unbelievable since she knew i was n't happy at all !
i do not recommend getting your clothes altered here .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
beyond horrible experience .
and disgusting actions .
does not accept any form of payment other than cash .
if i could give no stars i would , unfortunately .
unfortunately not a good review here .
she then told me `` sorry no receipt for you !
at that point there is nothing i could do .
she is dishonest , has no integrity and mean !
$ _num_ just to hem a dress ?
disappointed !
i have been buying batteries from these guys for quite a few years .
it remained on my shelf until a week or so ago .
i finally installed it to find out it was dead .
i tried to charge it , but it would n't take a charge .
i was told they would give me _num_ dollars towards a new battery .
i think its bad business to not inform customers of a possible warranty issue .
i will not be doing business with them anymore .
_num_ of them went bad within _num_ months !
would not recommend .
edit : i do n't like this place anymore !
also service was really slow for lunch .
ate here on my second night in vegas .
i felt like i was just drinking luke warm oil .
the pad thai and the curry i had we 're just okay .
very disappointing .
now much of their thai food tastes like bad chinese food .
noodle salad was only average .
it 's extra ghetto inside with the worst service ever .
i really ca n't complain though when the dishes are soo cheap .
the food just was n't good .
in fact , i would say it 's pretty disgusting .
i dunno , maybe i did n't order the right thing .
the sauce was so-so .
_num_ flavors were dense ( pad thai and pad see ew were okay .
tom kha coconut soup , ive had better .
_num_ the name of the restaurant ?
the food here is mediocre , but it is pretty cheap .
the staff is n't very friendly .
excuse me ?
showing me some link is n't going to change my taste buds .
i gave this restaurant two stars for a reason .
i 've left far worse reviews at other places .
thai soup only so-so and the fried rice barley passable .
other dishes in the past have also fallen short .
sorry kung fu plaza .
it was so uncomfortable in there .
and , everybody was trying to wish a good evening , etc .
guess the thought of a tip was overpowering to them .
the tip was $ _num_ , which was way too much !
we tried their chicken pad thai to-go for _num_ .
i 'm not thai , but the noodles are wrong .
thin , short , viet style noodle in pho ?
horrible .
i tried the pad thai and garlic chicken with rice and didnt like either .
the pineapple fried rice was just soggy .
they specialize in thai , and chinese food .
i would rather go to the strip and pay and eat americanized chinese food .
we walked into an almost empty place , and were ignored .
their menu has _num_ items ... ridiculous .
did n't even ask us if we wanted anything else to drink .
tasted the water and walked out .
wo n't be back .
if you find yourself eating here do n't .
papaya salad was the only thing worth mentioning .
should have kept driving ... bad bad bad .
my first time here and i 'm never coming back.
the prices are crazy we pay $ _num_ for a really bad dinner !
service was horrible .
the fried rice was oily and lacking flavor .
pad thai was nothing but peppers and bland .
even panda fried rice than this place .
poor customer service as well .
horrible experience .
we ordered our food online _num_ hours ago and still no food .
worst experience i 've had with lunch .
parking is terrible .
service is even worse .
food quality was not good ; very bland and not fresh .
no condiments on the table , and not even enough for each table .
they also did n't have enough menus for everybody .
we ordered a curry dish , kung pao chicken , and a shrimp dish .
poor quality ingredients , and no taste to it .
remember those terrible shrimp that are in those _num_ cent cocktails in downtown casinos ?
if i could give them _num_ stars i would .
this was the worst thai food i 've ever eaten .
wish i would have mcdonalds instead of this crap .
priced way to high too .
just a really bad choice if you eat here.
then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food .
about _num_ plus minutes later we received our entrees .
the food was underwhelming at best .
it caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting .
me and my husband ate here today for their lunch specials .
we were like thats the point because the food was garbage !
this restaurant has bad service , bad food and the restaurant smelled bad too .
they said a driver was heading out with it .
almost four hours for a meal is insane .
furthermore , they did not deliver the correct drink .
why did we wait so long ?
worst customer service experience ever .
will not be coming back !
kung fu restaurant broke an important rule .
actually not really .
immediately after walking inside there was a booth available ( i wonder why ) .
the soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice .
but kung fu does n't give any breaks with the soup .
the war won ton soup is around $ _num_ .
i ate everything down to the plate including the sauce .
he was n't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies .
first of all the `` chicken '' was heavily battered .
this meal was worse then the chinese food station at the palace station buffet .
i was truly disappointed .
batter your own chicken !
chicken is cheap .
very disappointed !
too bad .
they 've just lost steady business .
stone cold food i should mention .
kung fu thai - you suck !
food is n't bad but service was awful !
orders came out individually and waiters are n't as attentive .
the service is very slow .
i had to wave a waitress down after waiting _num_ minutes .
i give it _num_ stars for no flavor .
such a disappointment !
i had to take a cab there to get my money back .
do n't waste your money or time .
they never refunded my money .
avoid this place at all cost !
, rice was disgusting ( how you mess you rice up !
i was so disappointed .
we walked in and it was if we were non existent .
he was indifferent and kind of ignored is the rest of the night .
ugh .
it was so thick i could n't stomach it .
mongolian beef was okay .
very small portion and i do n't eat that much .
egg foo young looked gross on the plate .
it just was n't that great like i thought it would be .
tried this place for the first time tonight based on the other yelp reviews .
the orange chicken was overcooked and somewhat burnt .
this is definitely a place i will not be coming back fo chinese again .
took twice as long to deliver as they said it would .
the food was not edible at all , very disappointing .
gave this place a second try , and it still failed .
the worst service ever .
then he just walked away .
food is mediocre and the service is horrible .
do n't know if i will be back ever .
the sweet and sour sauce is orange not pink or red and tasted terrible .
it was like honey .
the breading on the chicken was super thick and hard crunchy .
so was ok no veggies at all in it but it was ok .
and refused to take it back .
worst shrimp egg fu young ever .
no egg just chopped celery with miniature shrimp .
treated so badly after being a loyal customer for _num_ years !
terrible customer service !
you lost a great customer !
we walked out and went somewhere else .
he kept getting our order wrong and had to repeat several times .
not an unreasonable request .
we were very calm in out request and just kept getting blown off .
what a disappointment !
bad experience , cant order lunch special , _num_ mins to _num_ pm .
most likely wo n't return .
do n't waste your time .
not impressed .
both had way too many onions .
i would rate this a _num_ star if i had an option .
not to mention their short of staff , which occurred bad service .
they also forced us to tip them .
terrible service !
they said they only deliver _num_ miles out and i 'm _num_ .
terrible service .
half of staff will avoid eye contact .
will not be returning .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
`` no , we ca n't make food for you .
the woman says `` no we ca n't make food for you . ''
excuse me ?
she says no and that she is the only one in the restaurant .
how is this poor disgrace of customer service the only one at this restaurant ?
there are no chefs to cook our food ?
maybe that 's why we ca n't get our food .
she then states `` do n't worry , do n't worry !
not sure how long refund take . ''
so i gave it a few more mins and nothing .
after _num_ mins of sitting there i was pissed .
so we walked out .
the server was terrible .
ordered the tom yum jumbo shrimp soup which was not bad .
the mongolian beef was not that good .
it lacked flavor and just simply was n't tasty .
i repeated my explanation ... i 'm in for the night .
there was no papaya and it was so spicy i couldnt eat it !
it was pretty obnoxious .
once inside , i was n't impressed .
yup .
uh huh ... not just for light ... but from bellagio .
the vip people do n't know what they 're doing .
not when drinking tequila .
other than that he did n't like my face .
it 's really not worth the wait or the money .
that bar is disgusting !
overall bad food for overpriced prices and mediocre portions .
went her on yelp recommendations .
but , the food was rather flavorless , and nothing special at all .
my enchilada and bean burrito combo was nothing special , and just tasted bland .
i ate the food and it was decent .
went for lunch the other day .
now , beans and rice are pretty standard fare in a burrito .
nothing special or to remember , nothing horrible either .
made the mistake of giving them another shot .
small , overpriced and flavorless carne asada .
conclusion : came to this venue on a late night snack .
problem is the food was just to hold you over til the next day .
i did n't think the chicken nachos that i ordered was fantastic .
it was bland .
this was not one of them .
but that 's only going off the appetizer that i ordered .
not as great as people made it out to be .
i got the carne asada tacos and supreme nachos .
had wanted to try after spending nights @ money plays next door .
they also forgot the beans i asked to be added .
menu is basic mexican food .
others who ordered with me said fish tacos are great , quesadillas were basic .
probably wo n't return .
worst food ever .
chicken tacos are gross .
supreme nachos were bland .
the burrito with no rice was literally just a tortilla with meat .
no pico de gallo , no sauce , so cilantro , nothing !
only reason they got two stars is because they were fast .
horrible food though .
not authentic mexican food at all .
unacceptable , i cancelled the order .
do n't waste your time ordering from them , there 's better mexican places .
i would n't go back again .
i was craving mexican food .
i am throwing up and my stomach hurts sooo bad .
this is not going to be a good night .
guess he wanted the whole $ _num_ as a tip ?
the food , however is sub standard .
fish and chips were decent and the bartenders had little to no personality .
the server `` jennifer '' sucked .
bad attitude .
we asked for separate checks , ordered and was over charged for items .
she never cleared our table .
it was one check not split as requested when we sat down .
the server denied we had asked .
for crap service ?
we support the establishment by spending our hard earned money .
let me preface this review by saying that i did not eat here .
i wo n't be back .
the irish nachos were a bit bland .
we came in to get an appetizer , meal and possibly desert .
some people are physically unable to tolerate super spicy foods .
not sure what everyone is rating .
place felt old and creepy .
my entree was the steak and mushroom irish pie .
horrible service !
there was no `` hello '' `` welcome '' or anything of the sort !
needless to say we did not stay !
rude and disrespectful .
leaving , i ended up watching the game at the sporting house instead .
food was ok , waitress was horrible .
i get the feeling she really hates her job .
she was never around when we needed her because she was constantly busy gambling .
warm beer with a lame explanation of why !
went to have a cold pint with my hubby last week .
it 's monday night football , place is pretty empty .
my guinness is ice cold and the ketchup is some generic brand .
why would a pub save money on generic ketchup ?
very poor impression , might be why it was dead in there .
oh my dear god ... i do n't even know where to begin .
i counted _num_ times they said the f word .
this took about _num_ minutes to come out .
this is not good .
gross .
also , i believe the manager was there as well .
if you are not a regular you will be ignored .
no biggie .
before we did though , we asked her how much a pint was .
so she came back from asking , and it was $ _num_ a pint .
no thank you .
as much as i love the food here , i will not be back .
greedy , greedy , greedy .
there was absolutely no need to double your prices .
that last dish was $ _num_ !
so unacceptable and sad .
place was empty ... ordered a salad and corn beef sandwich .
the salad came out wrong .
this place sucks !
the server was confused most of the time and messed up our order .
for some reason she felt like she could not fix it .
do not eat here and waste your hard earned money .
stopped in last night after work to get some good and was really disappointed .
after waiting for _num_ mins ( yes that 's right , _num_ mins ! )
still , no apology or explanation on his part .
really disappointed that nothing was explained , no apologies and no comps offered .
the place has a smell and the beer was not good .
could not drink the first one .
told them it was bad and ordered another .
and it was bad .
so yes one bite !
this review is for the tuesday night trivia experience .
so annoying .
last week seemed so much more promising .
until then , i wo n't be returning .
horrible customer service , quality of food is comparable to del taco .
i had a friend check my car and he saw no leaks at all .
i find this to be highly dishonest .
with so many honest mechanics out there why use a dishonest one ?
their dishonest , rude and not respectful .
first off gone are the horseradish / cranberry flavored vodka shots .
secondly the menu has been reduced by a fair amount .
the food was still good but none of it knocked me off my feet .
the service was a bit slow even with the restaurant being mostly empty .
i purchased my tires from discount , however , they kept losing air .
i 'm not kidding .
she kept saying i 'm sorry , but you can tell she was n't .
of course , it was a crappy , rush job .
you could tell she did n't want to be there .
thank god i did n't get a pedicure !
gross !
but i was denied service .
if i could leave _num_ stars then i would .
the sign on the door clearly says walk in 's welcome .
i would of scheduled an appointment if i knew that was the case .
but i would make an appointment in the morning and she was always late .
i got really frustrated with that .
the front desk receptionist is not friendly or helpful .
told us it was coming from italy and would be around _num_ weeks .
order cancelled , using someone else to source our tile .
how bad was that !
got up and left never coming here again !
worst place ever !
zero stars !
this place was empty , but they rush my nails & hurt me twice .
she just looked at me like if i was crazy .
i would not recommend this place !
i would give this place a _num_ star !
it is now _num_ days later and no return calls or emails to resolve .
i would definitly not use them on your job .
will not return emails and no he has not left for his vacation yet .
not a good place to check out in vegas .
i would try another steakhouse .
the experience was bad from the start .
my experience at this location , however , did not meet my expectations .
my ribeye steak and the rest of our party 's filets arrived .
i will return , but just not to this location .
the host sat us down with a dirty look .
a seafood place with questionable seafood .
i went with a shrimp ceviche tostada and the fish tacos .
the service was fine , but the product is lacking .
the ceviche was just ok , a bit bland and nothing special .
i do not recommend this place .
they were plain and bland .
the relleno was greasy as well and soggy .
my last impression was how do i get out of here never to return !
this was my 3rd time here and they forget my food twice !
they should stick to their own hours of operation .
you never know until you try .
the only thing that did n't disappoint during our visit .
no lunch specials just an overly priced menu .
$ _num_ for a cheese quesadilla !
my chips were old and stale .
my chicken was dry , just hope do n't get food poisoning .
the service was not good .
i was not offered a salsa or water refill .
at checkout , the waitress just dumped the bill and left .
very cold and rude service .
definitely not going back because i had the worst molcajete in town .
only the two stars i am giving them for the service .
they run this business with garbage food with lame ass setting inside .
the waitress was either high or asleep , brought our food but all wrong .
not attentive whats so ever , food was bland .
this place needs some management , nothing special about this place .
food is ok fish ceviche not good .
but service was bad .
too slow , it was not even busy to be that slow .
if i could give them zero , i would .
this place is horrible .
( to call daddy , i later found out . )
then she says she will not have me demanding taxi fare .
uh , no stupid lady .
i just felt that it could have been better .
i met with mike back in july to design a memorial tattoo .
ridiculous .
_num_ stars .
do n't get me wrong .
my tattoo from studio _num_ ( my second ) is not a disaster .
unfortunately , not so .
seems like others have had better results with studio _num_ .
she then told me they gave the appointment to `` a regular '' .
that really made me feel important to them ( not ! )
she said sorry , and that was it .
the customer service was a massive disappointment .
she informed me that they were doing special $ _num_ tattoos on that day .
but then i met charlie .
then he insulted the tattoos that i already had .
she refunded my deposit and i went elsewhere .
cost me $ _num_ .
then i say , `` you forgot to give me my card . ''
as if i was gon na leave without it .
she was so excited we overlooked that and stayed .
originally , i gave this place a _num_ star review .
not sure who the new person is that books appointments but she 's rude .
so , i decided to consider that maybe she was having a bad day .
that 's not the case .
the woman who was at the counter barely looked at me and was rude .
she acted like it was a huge bother to even talk .
no thanks .
i went to studio _num_ after a friend recommended them .
it was a very shocking , painful and expensive lesson .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
extremely rude staff .
horrible customer service .
if you like it slow and stinky this is the place .
please find a better place !
tried breaking my lease early because of all these things .
i do n't feel safe here , i dread coming home everyday .
please do n't waste your time .
even thinner than the buffalo sauce .
and we could n't pay via credit card .
we ordered a large two topping pizza with _num_ buffalo wings .
the pizza was okay ... i 've had better ... but the wings !
do not order anything from here -- you will be ripped off !
$ _num_ for a _num_ '' pizza with two toppings !
how do you charge _num_ dollars for onions and _num_ dollars for bell peppers .
they told me _num_ minutes i waited _num_ minutes !
no customer service .
not worth it .
i was given a price of $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
that 'll teach me for trying to patronize `` the little guy '' .
unfortunately , that 's why they are where they are .
so , i left the store .
tried to return some product .
i ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken .
bad idea .
not going back and i 'm glad i did n't get a cappuccino .
i 'll stick either my standby of roma cafe on spring mountain .
never a bad experience there .
when we got the bill there were two sodas instead of _num_ .
we told the waiter assuming it was an error .
she said two glasses charge for two drinks .
she then informed me we 'll you are not allowed to split a meal ?
i was really embarrassed .
this is the most awful italian food i have ever eaten !
i did n't know you could ruin italian food this bad .
the restaurant was also lacking atmosphere .
until we received the bill , i thought the place was alright .
the chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious , i must say .
things turned very sour when we got the bill .
my buddies marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti .
they said no we can substitute it .
my friends wife changed her spaghetti , to one with a meat sauce .
her response ?
i could n't believe it .
i 've never met such an arrogant manager who did n't hear us out .
zero tip and never visiting again .
if i could give this place zero star , i would .
it 's not about the money .
we will never go back to this place again , poor customer service .
when we were there the place was very busy .
i feel i was ripped off at this restaurant .
the board clearly said it was $ _num_ .
when the bill came it was $ _num_ .
that totally spoiled the entire experience .
it was definitely not worth that price .
they said the eight got rubbed off the chalk board .
it was also very expensive .
for a cheap salad and a mediocre chicken parmesan it was around $ _num_ .
i could n't believe it .
mediocre place .
service is trying to sell over priced items .
house wine is less than expectations .
overall experience is disappointed .
when i talked to the owner alfredo be was ride aggressive and angry .
what a disaster of a place !
so very rude .
all _num_ of us left ... .
the food was terrible !
the bread was old and crusty and the service was slow and indifferent .
... what a waste and we ended up having to leave post bread .
for our entrees we ordered the chicken parm and the fettuccine shrimp and mushrooms .
both entrees made us feel sick to our stomachs .
both of us were sick all day .
the shrimp was tough and the fettuccine was very overcooked .
i 'm mad we wasted our evening here .
no wondering that place is empty .
my visit here had high expectations , and i was beyond disappointed .
the service was good , i def will not be returning .
we were slightly late and restaurant staff was n't bothered about that .
some time later , a bit too long , our complete order was taken .
our dining experience sucked and none of us will return .
as i said before , i take my family out once a month .
our first experience in feeling unwelcome here in vegas in _num_ years .
was disappointed !
the lady was quite rude about the situation and offered no recovery .
i 'm not stoked about this !
this was right after she handled my money !
last few weeks pizza hut has a carryout deal called the hut lovers deal .
which is a large two topping pizza for $ _num_ carry out only .
seriously pizza hut ?
i do n't even want to give this place one star !
way beyond disappointed with this franchise and their service !
worst pizza hut ever .
he then hung up on me .
oh yeah and the pizza tasted like cardboard .
bad customer service .
worst experience at a pizza hut ever .
no pepperoni ?
i 've called out hello multiple times and no one can hear me .
i didnt even get a sorry or a hello .
hands down the worse customer service ever .
never ordering here again .
yay another long rant on yelp .
he refused to acknowledge the issue .
please do not rent their equipment .
i was not completely satisfied with my experience with this company .
she told me they would come the next day to pick up my rentals .
i would only use this company again if i had no other option .
convince me that i can trust this school with my baby .
but no .
i felt like they rushed me !
i am so disappointed .
this place is not safe for your children .
management does a terrible job of running this daycare .
no it 's not !
this daycare off or rainbow and flamingo is absolutely is terrible .
save your money and time and look elsewhere .
no agency should cost anything to join !
ugh .
the music is horrible .
even that is n't fun at pink e 's .
man , i dislike pink e 's .
no pink pool tables , no pink anything !
they tried to charge a cover charge too , how insulting !
i was embarrassed for recommending this place .
i end up paying over $ _num_ .
i ca n't stressed it enough please do n't live here .
i was robbed and there 's was security on the grounds .
told by management too bad .
was it better than chipotle ?
not even equivalent !
i 'm sorry .
the food sucked !
complete fail !
so i lost close to two dollars .
mgr was not there _num_ in afternoon .
clerk could do nothing about it .
did not even go out and place an out of order sign .
very poor customer service .
would not use and will not ever again !
it was a bizarre experience and we will not be using their service again .
do not go here .
worst .
last _num_ visits to different locations very poor results .
the left second chair , a old lady , she is just terrible .
and she did n't let me explain what style i want .
i was going to a party and she just messed up my night ... .
overall i do n't think the food was that great .
bad pricing .
eating individual platters are n't worth it .
potstickers are pretty gross .
tried this place twice last week .
i might be slightly off on the exact price , memory fails me atm .
the decor and ambiance was ok , nothing spectacular .
only other people eating was a group of _num_ when we arrived .
complimentary was fried wonton strips with _num_ dipping sauces .
same waitress i had for lunch previously too .
the buffet was small and not very appetizing looking .
the bathroom was moldy .
they had no seats available , as there were large parties they were accommodating .
she told me that they did n't have time to cook it .
i dislike this place and will never go back .
even the appearance and smell was just blah .
this has not one piece of veg .
buffets do n't get much worse than this .
excuse me ?
ridiculous .
and proceeded to ignore him the rest of the time we were there .
terrible service .
these people are a disgrace .
living across the street , i 've been to this place a couple times .
not worth the mess for the prices they have .
do n't go here if you expect even remotely decent service .
very disappointed in this place because i honestly do like the food !
my wife is a server and i used to be one .
not to ask if everything was ok , not to refill drinks .
other tables were asked of everything was ok and had their drinks refilled .
she then quickly yelled in their language and a server approached us .
they shortly replaced the plate for us and apologized again .
by this time we lost our appetite and paid for the meal .
they obviously did n't know how to handle this situation correctly .
another place off the list !
i ordered kung po chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce , delivered .
i have never had such bad chinese food , even from a cheap buffet .
not sure why .
this was my second time and the first time was no great shakes .
food was barely tolerable .
potstickers were ground beef fried in oil that needed changing and was overlooked .
the mongolian beef was adequate but the teriyaki chicken meal was awful .
neither of us could eat it .
disappointing , but that happens sometimes trying new small places .
wo n't be back .
i 'm not a huge fan of target .
so i just went to another target that did .
workers are ok not super friendly but not nasty just ok .
everyone in this store is clueless !
i love target , but this one is not my favorite .
i ca n't seem to locate anyone when i am looking for something .
nothing we can do at the store .
why i 'm here for !
it 's hot as hell in here !
poor employees .
why wo n't they price match ?
really dumb policy .
not a good policy when their own website is what i was price matching .
i would have understood if it was walmart i was price matching .
the store manager at this location is the absolute worst !
i needed gas so i went to the closest station which was this one .
this location needs a total facelift - it 's old and dirty .
gas prices are a little cheaper here .
skip this if you have the chance .
no public restroom unless you are an employee .
fail .
all of their tanks were dirty and the staff ignored me .
finally just walked out .
i 'm sure that 's what the customer ahead of me was thinking .
very poor service .
not a fan of this petco location .
very unfriendly and so negative on things .
the store is neat and clean but there is just lack of choices .
if i could rate a zero , i would .
i would not go to this petco .
i will never go to this petco again .
well its a _num_ gallon tank nothing too big .
talking trash about how i dont know what im doing .
i told him he can just put the fish back that ill go elsewhere .
i will not return !
horrible company !
they should not be trusted .
they also just cut down trees with out working out a solution .
avoid !
it is mediocre at best .
they sucked again .
the biscuits were chewy and somewhat hard , gravy bland .
got coffee too , it sucks .
i quickly noticed their chairs and i loved how they 're new !
i was so upset with my self for trying this pathetic place .
i will never go this place ever again .
wrong decision .
cheesy mexican lounge singer singing christmas music added to the ambiance or something .
the rice and beans were not good .
absolutely one of the _num_ worst mexican restaurants i 've been to ever .
none of the _num_ of us ate it .
booths were too short for the table .
the free tortilla chips were dark and over fried , also tasteless .
the crunchy taco was a little greasy .
okay yelp , you did me wrong on this one .
this is the absolute worst mexican food that i have ever tasted .
the chicken did not have any flavor and was very dry .
overall , it was a horrible meal .
if it were n't for the excellent service this place would have _num_ star .
also , the mariachi band , awful and annoying !
i went here with a friend because of the reviews .
_num_ and _num_ stars ?
i do n't see it .
when they arrived they were sizzling hot but flavorless .
it 's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat .
the only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made .
i probably wo n't be back because it simply was n't worth it .
bland and ordinary .
however , the rice was bland .
my huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor .
unfortunately , there are no real vegan options .
even the beans are made with dairy .
this place was awful .
if you 're from la or sf skip and save your mexican for cali .
there 's no way it can be worse than this .
truly awful .
ambiance - a cut or two below denny 's , with mexican colors .
the best i can say is that i did n't actually see any cockroaches .
food - awful , awful , and more awful .
the tortilla chips were not fresh .
yuk as my daughter commented .
we had very bad customer service this time around .
yes , i 'm mexican so let me say that the food is mediocre .
i do n't understand why all their burritos are smothered in sauce and cheese .
a burrito is meant to be eaten with hands , not with a fork .
we had previously eaten here in may , _num_ .
the rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting .
the cheese was very stringy and tasteless .
the enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost inedible .
beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock .
she did n't care for any of it .
it 's not a nightclub .
needless to say i would never go back .
chipotle or even taco bell would be a preferred dining choice .
but there food is just not my type .
only ate _num_ shrimp that 's how bad it was .
_num_ ) salsa and bean dip were pretty good .
not much flavor .
yes , we could have sent cold food back .
what has happened to this restaurant ?
they arrived on a cold plate , not sizzling like they normally do .
the fajitas were flavorless .
no seasoning , just cooked meat and peppers .
what a disappointment .
the steak tasted salty which was weird .
the shrimp was a little too chewy .
the margarita was served on the rocks in a very small glass .
worst food we have had in a month .
we will not be back .
the dips were okay , not the best salsa .
the rest of the food was terrible .
not the worse mexican food we 've had , but close .
tried this restaurant based on yelp and another persons suggestion .
but after eating here it was disappointing .
nothing seemed to be very fresh and the vegetables were overcooked .
overall not great and will not be trying to return anytime soon .
this is not real mexican food .
yuck !
i 'm mexican this food is nasty stay away !
too bad that 's the only good thing about it .
customer service is bad and with an attitude .
i was so disappointed on the service .
i was so sad i brought my parents with me .
no cherries either .
the over weight sweaty waiter was not friendly at all .
the only friendly one in there was the female waitress with blonde hair .
she 's a gem stuck in that hole .
wish i could post a pic but it 's not giving me an option .
i wanted to like this place , i really did .
our waitress unfortunately was n't as nice .
but without even that , the food just is n't good .
but neither of us liked anything .
this has always been my favorite mexican restaurant especially for lunch .
for over two years i 've ordered lunch here ... never a problem .
we 'll give it one more shot but we were really disappointed .
party of _num_ by the way .
one of my kids fell asleep cause im still waiting and waiting ... .
this time was one of the worst !
the food was lacking flavor .
normally you get a huge plate full , not this time .
i doubt we 'll be back any time soon , if at all .
older server lady was completely rude .
did n't even ask for our orders for _num_ minutes of waiting to order .
not only that , food was somewhat cold on all our meals .
racist old server lady .
thankfully i did n't have something to go to afterwards .
it 's only hair , right ?
i then go up to pay and she charges me _num_ .
worst service i 've gotten from anywhere in a long time !
if i could give negative stars i would .
and i strongly suggest that if you decide to come here to be disappointed .
i say okay , no problem .
was this chick on the inside going to see how long i would wait ?
why did n't she just tell me that they were not open ?
big mistake !
after _num_ more minutes of sitting outside waiting to order , we were done .
it was smashed , poorly put together , veggies everywhere , soggy .
it was disgusting .
i could n't eat subway for another month .
i then stated to him i have my own oil , after saying that .
he said no you wo n't bring it back .
yes i handled it wrong , went off .
i 'm not letting this one go .
they also indicated that i could try free for _num_ days .
they were going to charge $ _num_ a month .
i will never order from here again !
i called for _num_ pepperoni pizza and guy was so rude .
i told him no problem .
so , i call to place an order .
well that 's no good .
guess i 'm not surprised .
was n't horrible , was n't fantastic .
we ordered pepperoni and only got 2-3 on each one .
maybe it would be better if it did n't sit so long .
i gave them _num_ star because they were nice .
i could n't even get through half of it .
unfortunately i ca n't make a meal from half an order of poppers .
something about the taste of each pie just seemed off .
guess it is back to looking for another pizza place near me .
was not going to be coming after all .
they do not deliver after a certain time .
they were not apologetic at all .
the garlic bread pizza was awesome .
it was the only thing that we all ate in common .
when the pizza arrived it looked bad !
worst mistake ever !
we all missed out on _num_ days of work because of this place .
i would n't recommend it to my worst enemy .
so yeah , you deserve less than _num_ star .
you would have called to tell me that you do n't actually deliver downtown .
in summary : do n't order delivery if you live in an apartment building .
the pizza is burnt and there is almost no cheese .
probably the worst lunch we have ever had today .
the spicy chicken strips may or may not have actually been chicken .
whatever they were did not taste good .
hard to describe but yucky .
the sandwich was soggy from steam in the container .
the bread was all soggy not just in the bottom .
i just had a horrible experience at this place .
after reading numerous reviews i opted to order delivery .
i placed an order for a specialty pizza and buffalo wings .
upon opening the box the pizza looked beyond unappetizing .
the crust was extremely thin , so much so that it was soggy .
the guy said _num_ to _num_ hour .
no apologies or nothing .
bad customer service .
i wo n't be ordering from here again .
terrible customer service !
never once had a problem until now .
literally had no meat on them .
hard and crunchy as hell .
dry and had no taste .
i was looking forward to just having some good pizza !
i was n't going to take a cab to pickup my order .
maybe for pick up it would have been better .
i expected more for $ _num_ us dollars by the way for pizza .
terrible massage , super sketchy place.
these women have no idea what a massage is .
this place is not a good one , if you are thinking to come .
i am very disappointed !
$ _num_ is the new norm and it is on every corner !
and i finally got it here ... the worst massage ever .
within _num_ mile if this rip off joint .
very very disappointing ... .
the $ _num_ monday night prime rib special will pull you in .
do n't believe the hype .
no thanks .
um , then maybe check the expiration date on that bottle .
not really the value it 's advertised as .
unfortunately believe it or not we were unable to get a table !
cook in the kitchen do n't know how to cook steak .
i give up i 'm not coming back .
someday soon i 'll have the seasoning down , too .
why bother ?
well would n't ya know everything was soggy !
walked in and it was kinda quite .
wo n't be going back .
when i got home i took my first bite into burnt meat hell .
will never use this business again .
the entire name was crooked and also several individual letters were crooked .
i have never been so damn offended at a convenience store .
they have permanently lost my business .
no matter what i need , i 'll never return .
i do n't even know why they ask how you want your haircut .
just walked out .
finally walked out .
hubby 's been here before with some friends .
we stopped in here to grab a few baskets of dim sum .
well , the dim sum was n't all that great .
it was mediocre at best .
the tripe was flavorless , the stuffed bean curd sheets were okay .
why be nasty ?
like , worse than the excalibur .
the architecture is really odd , too .
i might go back in a pinch , but probably not .
i tried three dishes each one was no better than microwave dim sum .
they sadly said chang 's was as good as it gets .
the dim sum here was hit or miss .
i was pretty disappointed overall with the food here the other day .
still , the dim sum here is pretty cheap though .
i might have to check out another dim sum place next time .
this place is expensive and not even good .
its really busy , but i prefer not to eat at this place .
no way ... thirty something i could have dealt with but _num_ ?
but not worth it !
they could n't even make simple food .
rating of zero is not available ?
went on one of the slowest times of the year .
lost money ... ok.
it just did n't pan out for us .
the place was half full , so we were seated promptly .
never use this restaurant for your wedding reception or any special banquet .
this was the first dim sum restaurant we try in lv .
btw , sometime is hard to find parking spot there .
the food to me was very salty .
limited dim sum selection , especially steamed food .
i 'd skip this place next time .
it had peanuts , dried shrimp , mushrooms , sliced pork .
most expensive dish at $ _num_ and not worth it .
so now why _num_ stars ?
are you fucking kidding me ?
loud , rude , obnoxious .
but food was just ok .
some cold !
does he drink hot tea , i think not .
the fried shrimp balls was ok , a bit dry .
the steam rice noodle with beef on the inside , was weird .
seems like it was steam with little fish eggs on top .
that was why the waitress keep wanting me to say yes for tea .
worst dim sum ever !
no one speaks english and no carts were coming around .
we just walked out after two dishes .
i will never be back .
unless you dont mind screaming across the table .
there was nothing special about this place , it was mediocre .
i probably would n't come here again .
they include tips , barely _num_ % i think .
they only had _num_ carts rolling around at the time we went .
no hot girls pushing around the cart what kind of place is this ?
i couldnt agree more with steve n. this place is pretty horrible .
the rest of the food seems cooked too long and the service is slow .
we experienced the worst , actually it was non existent service .
the hostess was rude when she seated us .
do italian restaurants bring asian customers chop sticks ?
she continued to ignore him and refused to turn around .
the hostess walked away and acted like it was not her job .
the food is mediocre at best and the service does not exist .
what for dim sum !
chang but for dim sum .
oh well , food was okay , i guess for vegas .
this place is a below average dim sum place .
i am probably not going to come back here .
food was horrible .
not comparable to la .
service was even worse .
wave them down but get ignored .
the only somewhat good service were the dim sum cart ladies .
everyone else was rude .
the water tasted like crap , there was a hair in the water .
and because of the rudeness , people will know how horrible it is .
and no it is n't because we were bitter .
it was that bad .
does the health department not check things anymore ?
the dim sum is just average at best .
i am chinese so i know dim sum !
the decor is lacking any luster very dated and needs renovation quick !
also , chang 's has raised their prices significantly .
not good to have your party .
owners does n't care if the party needs anything .
not coming back to hold for parties .
the food was nothing special .
it was good , but nothing out of the ordinary .
if i had then i would n't have even given their food a chance !
came here for dim sum to cure that hangover from last night .
i did n't really find these outstanding .
we came pretty early before the rush , so it was pretty dead .
we never get forks , who the hell uses forks ?
so now they assume everyone does n't know chinese and uses forks ?
i was really offended by the forks .
what the hell is going on ?
lot 's of _num_ stars , that 's weird .
we went there to eat in december and it was _num_ degrees outside .
the few ceiling fans only pushed the hot air around .
the dim sum tasted like leftovers from the day before and was n't fresh .
the manager , david is a sneaky , slimy piece of work .
nothing we had looked like that .
the menu was not even close to what the menus photo 'd look like .
just another average dim sum place , nothing too fancy or special .
service was quick but then again there was n't too many patrons to serve .
the dim sum was just average to me .
terrible service , asked for a refill on my water and never received it .
false advertising when they stated that they have dim sum all day .
we went there about 9pm expecting to get our favorite dim sum items .
unfortunately , they have dim sum some time not all the time .
our bill end up $ _num_ .
the food was mediocre .
probably not .
just get more employees , or do n't want people to come .
while some cart servers were friendly , some were not .
cold dim sum makes for a bad experience .
came in for dim sum .
food looked like it was left out over night .
we were starving so ate it anyways .
it was n't the greatest , but for the price .
the reason why i give it two stars is for the horrible service .
what i got was extremely slow service with just one waiter walking around .
our food stopped coming and we were barely approached .
the service and experience were horrible .
ambiance : _num_ - your average looking dim sum place .
it looks like any other dim sum place !
it took a little too long to get some water with my tea .
food : _num_ - taste was okay but not amazing .
otherwise , the rest of the food was pretty average and nothing special !
today when we got in the waiter already gave us attitude .
i do n't know what you guys are talking about when you say good .
it is mediocre at best .
they just wrote down the total instead of breaking down the bill .
he just gave me a dirty look like `` seriously '' .
then proceed to write the price on the side of the bill .
not far behind the home depot .
it 's bland .
probably should thank them for making me eat less .
boring atmosphere .
wo n't be returning , would n't recommend .
the rice was my favorite but i should not have gotten the chow mein .
this is totally ripped off !
dim sum looked like it was made a while ago .
they were not fresh .
not going back .
overall bill came out to $ _num_ for five of us .
the waiting time is worst !
the receptionist after giving you a waiting number seems do not care at all .
of course the waiter or manager did not apologize for trying to kill us .
the fillings tasted bad and not enough shrimp was used .
she poured water from a used cup then a napkin to wipe the table .
gross .
food was actually good , but the service here is horrible .
enjoy but add extra _num_ mins and some patience for horrible service .
i 've been here before and the dim sum was ok .
i walked out .
do not be fooled by the charm the owners try to give off .
the service the time i ate there was horrible and quite frankly rude .
the main chef did n't wash hands after smoke breaks .
do n't risk going here until they resolve everything .
they 've been shut down more times than i would imagine .
get these horrible restaurants out of our valley or to clean up .
_num_ - _num_ ( _num_ ) .
do not recommend to anyone and we will not be back .
food taste good but the smell of the place was awful .
do not eat here unless you like roaches sharing your dim sum with you !
this is horrible .
the same dessert cart keeps coming around too .
also , the only dish we have sucks .
it 's so bad .
ca n't even get the food off the plate because it 's falling apart .
the staff would not speak to us .
they had like _num_ carts with the same things over and over .
tea was not very good .
i wo n't be back .
it was not good , at all .
do n't go here ... had food poisoning last night from eating their food .
wish i can give zero stars .
however , i was disappointed with their cuisine , ambiance and service .
the meat is either overcooked or undercooked in this place .
i would not recommend this place .
chicken fried rice was atrocious .
i finally got my order and rushed home to eat it .
the tofu was fried , hard & gross !
gross ) .
i finally got my order and rushed home to eat it .
the tofu was fried , hard & gross !
gross ) .
service was incredibly slow .
it was really overcooked .
the beef tasted like mushy baby food .
i could n't figure out how half was hot and half ice cold .
his fried rice had pork that was good , beef tasted old and weird .
and _num_ lunches were $ _num_ with the tip .
final opinion , i would n't eat here again if it was free .
disgusting .
the pad see ew was served without chinese broccoli as an option .
the sauce was some sort of a generic chinese style teriyaki sauce .
the chicken was bland .
unfortunately , this was the best dish of the meal .
the green curry with beef was also a miss .
just plain boring .
the flavor was off .
again , no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor .
it was also bland as heck .
the chicken was dry , and there was no flavor to speak of .
is this food for _num_ year olds ?
yeah , the jerky was n't good either .
the meat tasted of poor quality .
you might want to just stick to the chinese stuff .
maybe its a cultural thing , i dont know .
_num_ tom yum , pad thai and eggrolls ... probably $ _num_ of food .
i wont be coming back due to your poor customer service .
located in a run down strip mall and has been there many years .
nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic .
was more chinese than thai .
waited _num_ minutes to place drink order .
probably will not go back .
disappointing .
the pepper steak i ordered was just not very good .
would give it a higher rating , but the service was terrible .
it was 5:30 , no one else in the place .
sad , good food ... terrible service .
not what i was hoping for .
i ordered _num_ bottled waters for us and there was only _num_ available .
i 'm now begin to lose my appetite and get frustrated .
why , the place is empty !
overall , this place is nothing to brag about .
i came in a party of _num_ .
they do n't have all the food they show on the menu .
they play only one song over and over and over .
he did n't even get to eat it cause we had to go .
some yelpers rate this restaurant _num_ and _num_ stars ?
come on , it is not even close to a three .
here , the food was poor to unremarkable .
the food was mediocre at best .
not thai spice .
they only do this because this is their busiest stop .
avoid this place .
i 'll just renew online and save the ten dollars .
do n't go to this jiffy smog !
there are a million better stations to go to and i wish i had .
should have read reviews before making the mistake of coming here .
rip off !
with a competitor coupon , they still charge $ _num_ at the lowest .
why would anyone get a smog test besides to register their car ?
so the lowest you will pay is $ _num_ !
rude .
i 've been here quite a few times and usually get them for delivery .
now i know why ... service is pathetic .
obvious return business is not their priority .
ordered a baked rigatoni with sausage and an appetizer basket for carry out .
mind you the rigatoni supposedly comes with a _num_ cheese blend .
no return business here .
i have had it with this poorly run business !
and to charge $ _num_ for _num_ chicken fingers is a joke !
the lady that runs the flamingo location needs to wake up .
customer service is king i will drive _num_ more miles for service .
wont be going back not with all the better options in the area .
unfortunately i did n't think so .
i want be going back .
do n't waste your money .
she looks around her area and tells him no .
me : `` no , i gave you two $ _num_ bills . ''
this branch is awful .
slow service .
this branch is awful .
service slow .
a man is yelling at a teller .
ca n't seem to resolve my issue .
terrible all around !
it was horrible !
i will never go to metro pizza again .
i do n't know what was worse the food or the decor .
ick !
if you did n't stop reading my review after that last statement , thanks .
and settled my check , then headed out the door .
also , lose the neon .
been visiting this spot for over _num_ years .
this pizza is a joke , its not pizza by any standard .
you will def not want it again .
toppings were alright , but not enough and poorly placed .
the worst part about it was the price .
way too expensive for this boring pizza pie .
no thanks .
i have met the owners , they used to be all about the pizza !
now it is overpriced , the food does not have the same flavor .
a huge oily disappointment .
cold , with an undercooked center and sparse toppings .
i 've tried this place _num_ times now and it 's nasty .
pizza gone done a notch and the service has too .
maybe we hit them at a bad time , but i was unimpressed .
what i got was under cooked and very oily .
maybe i will try again , but not for pizza .
was okay nothing too different .
however when the items arrived there was everything under the sun accept silverware .
love metro pizza 's tropicana location .
the garlic knots are half the size and overcooked .
the service at this location was horrible .
i will not return to this location .
i guess you 'll just have to skip pizza for a bit . ''
ugh .
dirty & dingy ... in bad need of a remodel .
nothing like their new location in centennial hills .
seriously , this place looks gross and the staff is slow .
horribly slow .
super disappointed in our experience here .
we walked out and wo n't be coming back .
there is no flavor to the cheese they use .
these guys really need to step it up .
the service is really bad .
and the food is not consistent with the other locations at all .
it was so unappetizing .
how could standards be so low ?
came here during happy hour and the service was horrible .
it was slow and like no one cared .
i will not be back .
the customer service was extremely poor when we were there .
we ordered _num_ pizzas and a pitcher of beer .
there was no bartender on duty .
choosing us of stealing it was very disrespectful .
at this point the issue was closed .
there was no reason to get the cops involved .
this has just been a shocking and horrible experience .
you be the judge ; however , if you expect consistency go elsewhere .
this time the stuffed pizza was barely stuffed with the meat items .
it was more pizza dough than anything else .
very disappointed !
so he left with my pizza an drinks completely unacceptable .
the taste is very average , but the worst part is the crust .
i 'm bummed , was hoping for so much better .
this place is awful , in particular the service from the get go .
upon receiving our pizza , there was no receipt .
sadly , i was really under impressed .
i researched a bit on yelp before going to see what yelpers suggested .
service was minimal and food was underwhelming .
it tasted like tomato soup thrown over noodles .
really disappointed with it after spending $ _num_ .
don ; t be a sucker and fall for this junk .
eat cardboard instead .
any other pizza place would be better .
no comp offered and it had been well over an hour already .
i called the manager and demanded our money back and to forget the food .
no class .
it 's a shame this happened .
this place had no clue .
seemed funny but i could n't get past the seating ... .
he still did a crappy job but did come back .
nobody came out so i gave the office a call .
i will call one more time but it 's really not worth the money .
then they switch to a new guy and it was less than adequate .
picking up and returning takes way too long .
not wait until you get there to clean and wash it .
_num_ hour later , you 're all set to go start your day .
worst .
no apology for making us wait .
horrible !
terrible customer service .
i wouldnt rent from them again .
they did n't have the truck after we made a reservation .
their policy is that they may or may not have the truck you reserved .
the nice lady said no problem and adjusted to pick up time .
i walked in to her office and asked what happened .
so i asked the agent why he did n't see that ?
this place sucks .
worst customer service .
i am not making any of this up or exaggerating this all really happened .
i have never been to a port of subs before .
the veggie toppings were n't as fresh .
guess where i 'm going for my next work lunch sandwich ?
if i could give them zero stars i would .
there is no reason to ever be this unprofessional !
been here _num_ times and wait time was over an hour and a half .
absolutely ridiculous .
will never return and not recommend !
i just wish they would do something about the wait times .
they are n't the only people whose time is valuable .
unacceptable !
they really do n't even deserve the one star .
horrible service !
doctor was very good but service is bad .
long wait times in office and on supplies .
been waiting _num_ months for contact lenses .
candy the office manager is mean and gets defensive real quick .
not worth the headache .
the staff is completely cold & rude .
the man who did my nails was nice .
talk about terrible customer service !
i would never go back there again and would not refer anyone there .
if i could give them zero star , i would !
worst place ever .
very bad customer service - owner will talk about you in vietnamese .
would never go there again and would not recommend to my worst enemy .
do n't even go unless you have the best insurance available .
i called to cancel .
i called back and he refused to speak to me .
i am sorry but this restaurant sucks .
food , service , everything was horrible !
anyway , the wait staff sucked .
this place is not and will never be cool .
the food is underwhelming ... the prices astounding !
in fact , the service was outrageously slow .
the food was n't bad , it was just boring .
the food was less than decent -- not even worth half its price .
our waitress simply dropped off our check and rushed off to the next table .
oh , yes ... shame on you , ferraro 's .
keep offering 1/2 off deals for locals and then treating us like crap .
by far the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
this is a place who has entrees in the _num_ dollar area so ... .
oh , and the food was mediocre .
service was unacceptable here .
and was not follow up on .
asked for manager and was _num_ minutes before he stopped by .
is vegas really this bad ?
major disappointment and expensive mistake !
the lobster ravioli wasnt bad , but nothing special .
my friend had spaghetti and meatballs and it was bad .
how does an italian restaurant screw up spaghetti and meatballs ?
it was $ _num_ .
not impressed .
i ordered ravioli and it was still frozen and had no sauce on it .
the room was beautiful , but we were sat in a very uncomfortable booth .
my wife had the spaghetti and meatballs .
over cooked and totally lacking flavor .
the lack of flavor confused me .
and the service sucked .
the bartender might 've been the most unfriendly bartender i 've ever had anywhere .
it cost $ _num_ for only two drinks and two apps .
my friend order the risotto the price was $ _num_ .
no we did n't get dessert !
go figure an italian restaurant with mexican cooks ?
possibly the worst italian food we 've ever had .
also it was very over priced .
overcooked , dry , almost inedible .
what a shame !
the only thing good is the bread with oil and vinegar .
service sucks just as bad .
sorry i did n't get his name .
made reservations because someone in our party was craving italian food .
really disappointed because this restaurant had good reviews .
their _num_ % off for locals is a big rip off .
went here monday with girlfriend and family for my girlfriends bday .
the waiters attitude did n't change all night .
pushy , short answers , and just not pleasant .
we left with a very negative feeling .
this man should not be working in the hospitality business .
i left ferraro 's disappointed .
the risotto was a total disappointment .
if there was any lobster meat in it , i could n't tell .
i could neither see any or taste it .
even though someone else paid for my dinner , i felt cheated !
finally , ferraro 's does not allow any outside wine .
the food was pretty expensive and only average .
imagine olive garden at the double the price .
the worst part was the very overpriced wine list .
i am an experienced wine drinker as i travel and collect wines .
my buddy commented he will also not return .
we will not be back .
i made my first & last trip to this restaurant .
we did n't see our server again until it was time for the check .
after waiting another _num_ minutes the check was presented .
the server was american and did n't speak any italian .
also lacked authenticity .
the spaghetti was over cooked and the meatballs were average .
it 's almost painful to talk about it .
i 've been a customer of ferraro 's for more than _num_ years .
i was hosting a party for _num_ business associates .
hmm , i did n't quite like that , but brushed it off .
service was incredibly slow .
so i sent it back .
the next time it came out , it was blue .
surprised , appalled , angry , disappointed .
at this point , i realized that our relationship is over .
the service was very very bad .
other than that , we never saw him .
it was absolutely flavorless .
the tomatoes in the caprese salad were not even ripe .
the `` cesar '' salad dressing was blah .
i am not sure what everyone sees in this place .
run away do not eat here unless your a local .
they treat non regulars like crap !
how rude .
was horrible !
customer service is less than _num_ star .
they do n't appreciate your business and have declined over the years .
much too expensive for the quality of food & service .
i had to salt and pepper my osso buco more then once .
very bland .
manager could n't do anything for us at all .
so many glowing reviews and i was just disappointed .
the waiter was not cheerful or pleasant .
but this is one instance where i would rather have gone to the strip .
you had potential , ferraro 's , but i 'm not a happy customer .
the service was also severely lacking .
unfortunately this did not heat up the water as he intended .
and then later , `` ready to order ?
just dropped it off quickly on his way to another table .
you always feel welcome and greeted warmly by the owners , unlike ferraro 's .
the worst italian food i have ever had .
they have a huge wine list , over hundreds of wines to choose from .
i hate when restaurants rush the service .
the service was bad and we were rushed .
not the great experience we were looking for .
the fruit flies in the bar area are a definite problem .
i went to ferraro 's restaurant with two business associates last week .
we politely declined that option and instead each got a glass of wine .
not for us ... our food came out warm after a long wait .
i would not recommend !
hard to get a waiters or bartenders attention .
poor attitudes .
what a bad experience !
well , this is not going to happen !
plus the place was empty , nobody was waiting for this table .
with at least _num_ other people each time .
i just had the most disappointing experience at this restaurant .
service is pretentious and slow .
very disappointed !
i never felt so disrespected .
this by far , was the rudest worker i have ever spoken too .
he lost our business before we even stepped one foot in the restaurant .
customer service is terrible .
i am very disappointed !
very slow service .
we waited approximately _num_ minutes to be greeted .
they have the most expensive italian wine list i 've ever seen .
the veggie that came with it was awful .
as hilarious as it sounds olive garden has better food ?
i used the yelp check in coupon for a free appetizer .
the food tasted bland .
when i checked into my hotel i searched for italian restaurants close by .
i was n't looking for something super fast , but the wait was excessive .
she admitted she had forgotten to put in the order .
however , this was not what i expected to spend for happy hour .
so half of us never got our drinks .
bartender did acknowledge that he owed us our drinks .
problem is , the drinks never came .
well , neither did a server .
_num_ more minutes passed and i had to stop someone to help us .
he gave us menus & took our app orders and never came back .
even the table next to us was being helped .
that 's unacceptable .
she was nice but still did n't really check on our table .
but she was n't using a coupon , it was a gift card .
it 's not .
was charged $ _num_ for chicken alfredo because it was n't on the menu .
unimpressive .
oh , and there was a cheesy lounge singer .
very disappointed .
usually yelp is dependable .
not this time .
their food was awful .
i ordered chicken marsala and it was dry and tasteless .
i was so disappointed .
not good .
awkward service and strange dishes .
it was an overly smooth texture and bland flavor to eat by itself .
i chose lobster ravioli as my main course .
i expected more for a $ _num_ meal .
i feel as though i wasted a meal in vegas .
skip this spot .
it 's been a year now since i 've gotten my 3d eyebrows done .
result : _num_ different eyebrows .
_num_ years later no improvement .
i have no idea how min could have a single good review .
i went in for my lips .
the entire experience was horrible .
the results are a permanent mistake .
i am from out of town and flew out the next day .
a couple days later the `` look '' was worse , not better .
as it stands , there is very little to do .
its now summer and it just hurts too much with the sun .
the teachers are decent , but the prices are ridiculous .
prices are low .
my queen comforter cost me $ _num_ .
my apparel items do n't smell clean though .
they do n't smell dirty either .
i have no reason to come back here .
could not sign lease until moving in per the property managers .
they are fucking damn stupid !
nonsense !
you guys are really not good at lying !
how rude you are .
i needed _num_ days and they said nope , just like that .
i wish there were multiple options with gas because this company is incredibly frustrating .
first they need me to fax a copy of my lease and id .
1st installation date is missed and the house is cold .
they make your payment choices so difficult .
the only thing it says online is payment processed , not returned .
i keep calling and trying to fix the issue .
you block me from paying my bill .
and you put me on a permanent block , while charging me fees .
shame on you southwest gas .
this is not good customer service .
this is unacceptable .
hire more technicians because that is very unprofessional !
this is ridiculous !
wow , i have no idea why this is still in business !
they definitely hate each of us who call them and offer them our business !
next , their information on yelp is outdated .
why would a business not keep their business number when they move ?
however they feel like to .
today is friday dec _num_ , they do n't work .
this is the wrong attitude to treat customers .
especially , this is las vegas !
why is it that difficult to provide people with quality gas services ?
seriously the worst customer service .
i thought time warner was bad , but apparently not .
no hot water , no heat in the apartment , no stove .
it is ridiculously cold .
horrible horrible customer service all around .
tried to call the company to report it and they could n't care less .
_num_ ) fine , i paid their bill .
overall she had a very rude attitude .
i would give less than _num_ star if yelp would let me .
this company has by far given me the worst customer service of my life .
my dog could do a better job .
there 's a reason all of the `` real '' reviews are _num_ star .
this company sucks .
so now i have no hot water , ca n't cook over the weekend .
if i could give zero stars i would .
umm haha i asked to speak to a supervisor not you again ?
she then transferred me to her supervisor after being put on hold yet again .
why is n't there a back up plan ?
horrible !
u guys r horrible !
one of the worst company ever .
apparently this was a bill from a home i `` bought '' in _num_ .
i can see why there are so many complaints .
worst customer services .
called to figure out why auto pay was not working properly .
southwest gas customer service is horrible !
and for the record , lisa in your emergency after hour dept .
as if my needs were not important as the next .
poor customer service !
especially lisa in your after hour emergency dept .
your company should not be getting _num_ star as far as im concerned !
terrible customer service after being put on hold for _num_ minutes .
no personality , no straight answers and just plain rude .
if there was an alternative , i 'd be there .
they are so money hungry like every other company in las vegas nevada .
so this thanksgiving , my boyfriend 's mom and i were making dinner .
while we were there , the service was very unfriendly .
i walked in looking confused not really knowing where to go .
no one asked if i needed help or anything .
in a rude and unhelpful tone .
anyways , the stuffing turned out to be ok .
she seemed offended that we needed extra time for decisions and drinks took forever .
i was furious !
she must not value tips either .
could not eat there .
hot chocolate was basically water with chocolate dropped in it .
table next to us sent orange juice back because it had something in it .
finally decided it was way too disgusting and we went somewhere else to eat .
wasted a lot of time waiting to redo the bills , twice .
only ... not really .
finally , we have cornbread .
an attentive waitress would have noticed , this one did not .
i wo n't be back .
it was salty and way too thick .
it was tasteless , apple was too crunchy , and not enough sugar .
if you are from new york , philly , boston .
a total waste of time and money .
the salad itself was decent , but the croutons were soft and flavorless .
my wife ordered spaghetti with meat sauce .
it screams outdated , lack of standards , and absolutely disgusting food .
i have heard of nora 's cuisine from tons of people .
i for one as i said , was underwhelmed .
the side of pasta was another thing altogether .
the pasta was way too al dente !
the sauce lacked any seasoning .
the chicken was n't breaded at all .
he also has the same complaint about the tomato sauce : bland .
but this dessert wo n't change my review of nora 's .
i have to say , nora 's really failed to impress me .
i was wrong .
the sauce lacked any flavor whatsoever .
we were never offered a wine list , which i thought was odd .
we ordered _num_ entrees ... chicken parmesan & sausage rigatoni .
it was served with about a pound of pasta ( literally ) .
i make better chicken parm at home .
the entire check came to around $ _num_ for _num_ people .
overall , nora 's was just ok .
but , atleast i can say i 've gone .
if you want some more garlic bread , it 's $ _num_ per basket .
my lasagna was gross .
it had pounds of cheese to mask the nasty flavor of the dish .
the works dish was somewhat better .
all together it was rather nasty .
we left very dissappointed .
this place is really bad .
my mother in law had the nasty cold lasagna .
the cheap tasteless bread was the highlight of this dump .
do not waste your money here !
we could n't figure out why anyone would recommend it .
what a disappointment !
the fried calamari was terrible !
the chicken parm was another disappointment .
an italian restaurant that serves pasta swimming in water ?
c'mon that ai n't right .
no reason to give this place a second try .
my friend had recommended this place and claims to really like it .
nora 's used t be much better and they can do better .
we were quickly seated and given menus .
that dish was so salty as to be inedible and was sent back .
it was another _num_ minute wait for it to be replaced .
menu prices here were average for a restaurant of this caliber .
a glass of `` house red wine '' was $ _num_ .
i am not one of those people .
the pizza was ok too , it was bland no flavor at all .
the clam linguine disappointed us the most !
worst clam linguine i 've ever had !
we were really disappointed at this place and we 're never going back .
just a bad dining experience over all .
i was embarrassed .
then you charge for bread now !
the waiter spilled wine on my friends pants .
no ill get you a rag or nothing !
then when packing up leftovers they jam everything into a little box .
if you are trying to cut corners i suggest you raise your prices !
this place was by far a _num_ star !
please do n't mess this place up .
i 'm am shocked this place has an average _num_ stars .
lots of room , it really filled up the longer we were there .
ick !
i ate one and did n't even want to finish that one .
disappointed there were only _num_ shrimp in the dish .
the fettuccine tasted like box pasta .
my friend got the same dish and was disappointed as well .
my husband got the gnocchi with vodka sauce and added chicken .
we 've had gnocchi before also and these were very heavy and gross .
so steps in boring lasagna and ( non breaded ? )
chicken parm so bland that i 'm pretty sure i could make it myself .
they used to be better .
food good , i was too late to get my favorite rib eye sandwich .
what was once my go to , is no more .
the chicken parmesan is not breaded and is sitting in a tasteless soup .
we had _num_ pm reservation ( place closes at _num_ ) .
room had _num_ other tables with guests dining .
we order cheese sticks , spinach salad and _num_ entrees .
they were ok , nothing special .
as we were finishing our salad , we noticed the room got empty .
from this moment on , the waitress started to rush us .
barely five minutes after , she came back and asked ' all set ?
this time , the garlic bread was the only great item .
cocktails were ok , nothing special .
wo n't come back .
that did n't sit well with me .
now you lost a potential regular and your old regular .
the waitress was very nice , however , the food lacked completely .
out complementary at the end , but again , even that lacked flavor .
completely disappointed .
this was my favorite restaurant in las vegas for years .
it seems like this is now under new ownership .
the food was horrible the worst italian food ever .
very unfortunate .
luckily , i had the chicken which came with salad .
this was one of the most mediocre restaurants i have visited .
it is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss .
their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house .
i am not even comparing this to italy standards .
awkward .
it is all hype .
we had a horrible experience here tonight .
our server was awful .
i asked for lemon for our water twice and she never brought it .
service was slow the entire time .
we will not be back .
the calamari was a little chewy .
the baked rigatoni was over cooked .
the restaurant itself is a little outdated .
our waitress was rude and inattentive .
would not go back !
the food i tasted here was low quality and did not taste freshly made .
after sitting down , the garlic bread was brought out right away .
i ordered the alla nora and my friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken .
my pasta was baked in an oven and came out piping hot .
the first bite i had was awful .
he apologized and expressed his embarrassment for the situation at hand .
unfortunately i 've had much better italian food and service at other restaurants .
they were hot and tasted like any other plate of mozzarella sticks .
tasty but nothing special about them .
instead of trying another dish , i will just try another restaurant .
the hostess had a cold attitude .
no smile , did n't feel welcomed .
main course was served all cold , meat had no flavour .
there are many other places to spend my money for real local food .
we saw there were _num_ other tables in the section already set and empty .
that was with the _num_ tables still empty .
it was described to be loaded with jumbo shrimp , chicken and sausage .
no smile , just attitude .
20-30 minute wait for a table so we opt for the bar .
so the reason for the low score is the extremely rude hostess .
basically this woman ruined the night .
not at nora 's .
sorry nora but you dropped the ball on this one !
the food was great but the service was terrible !
it was suggested we eat at this italian restaurant .
the staff was friendly , but by no means is this good italian food .
once it was ready we were promptly transferred to the dining room .
placed order for 1st cocktails , appetizers , entrees .
ordered 2nd cocktail because we had n't recieved food .
she did n't approach our table until we requested our check through the busser .
however justin the busboy is a _num_ star employee .
i was not impressed ; i can make better spaghetti .
before last night i would have always given nora 's a _num_ star !
last night something went terribly wrong .
but deciding between the two can be difficult .
not anymore .
it 's $ _num_ and they reduced it to about a 1/3 the size .
last night i could eat it straight away .
the garlic bread was amazing ( only reason for even one star ) .
i have never in my life had chicken parm with mint .
needless to say , we wo n't be back .
yesterday , however , was not one of those days .
there was so much ham i could n't taste anything else .
no one asked me if i needed more water .
no one came to inquire about my satisfaction with my dish .
had someone done so early on i might have had them remake it .
we were so disappointed !
neither was what we expected and neither was very good .
the service was also awful .
we wo n't be going back .
my husband and i had not gone for dinner in probably _num_ months .
unfortunately the food gave me food poisoning .
i 'm not sure if i will be returning due to this recent experience .
if you like salty food , then i would recommend this dish .
the kitchen was extremely slow on the weeknight we visited .
it was not a busy night , as there were empty tables .
no sides , no appetizers , just five main courses .
we like to patronize locally owned restaurants , but were disappointed with our experience .
but a half an hour wait was a little ridiculous .
prices are reasonable though .
pasta not home made and i am skeptical about the sauces .
long story short , do n't believe the hype , all flash no substance .
i was disappointed .
food was not particularly good .
service was poor .
i am sad to say we will not be back .
i 've been wanting to try this place for years .
shame .
what happened to this place ?
the sauce was brown , and bland .
it was not the fresh red sauce we used to get .
disgusting !
she keep calling the wrong name so we ended up seated down at 9pm .
but no !
then our second order did not come until 30-45 min after the first course .
that 's not really an issue .
no one was there .
no apology .
how about no dessert and you just discount our bill ?
so much time wasted .
we are not going back .
the atmosphere is as lackluster as the servers and food .
rigatoni was highly recommended ( over the lasagna ) by the server .
the service does n't deserve a star !
instead , we received a hurry up and eat .
the food is great the service is horrible !
the father was n't happy as well .
i 'm italian and super disappointed in the service here .
they do n't make their own noodles or meatballs .
the bartender is super rude .
i had it done elsewhere for _num_ reasons .
i did n't feel that was very professional .
wish i could give no stars .
she was rude and had a very nasty attitude .
trust me i will not email you again .
maybe if you were n't so overbearing you may have had a customer .
she has a bad attitude !
most buffets in that same price range do n't feature anything edible .
i dont even want to look at it .
i walked into my room and the first thing i noticed were the beds .
this is a review of the gold coast 's coffee shop steak special .
this is the $ _num_ _num_ oz .
there was a slight fishy flavor but under the crust they tasted okay .
the big disappointment was the steak .
i think that gold coast may have done that here .
but this was probably the absolute worst meal i paid for in my life .
say it with me : absolute worst .
absolute worst .
fruit choices were minimal too .
this may be why they were kept behind glass , available only upon request .
we have been getting $ _num_ steaks at gold coast for years !
i am giving this place _num_ stars since we had a pretty bad experience .
probably will not be coming back here unless its free or comped .
ick .
jason at the front desk was super friendly .
the valet staff was polite and helped with our bags .
but we left a wallet in our room and checked out .
no wallet .
the maid just came up on $ _num_ .
nice location , but very bad room .
the casino and restaurants are ok .
coast properties are generally nice , but this was the worst one .
gold coast has landed right on my let 's not las vegas list .
as in _num_ and over .
it 's not flat out bad .
it 's just not very good .
i have stayed in worse places .
some people would probably give the gold coast _num_ stars .
like people that have not stayed in a lot of hotels .
or that have not stayed in nice hotels .
scary & nasty !
they have never returned my email .
the one thing about this place is that the room rates are always cheap .
2x odds ?
get the fuck outta here .
the front desk service is horrible .
not hospitable at all .
he said no and had given me a standard room .
should n't they know who booked what ?
the check in process was very frustrating .
flat screen tv .
the pool and hot tub did n't look too great .
the cocktail waitresses were pretty beat and not very nice .
good place if you like an older crowd ( _num_ and up ) .
ugly uncomfortable chairs were the only seating option other than the stiff bed .
this was not going to be possible in this awful room .
same room as the 3rd floor with slightly newer furniture .
even the toilet seat was uncomfortable !
no doubt even better rates could be had with some advanced notice .
are from _num_ and do n't work .
all-in-all , spend the extra money to stay at a better hotel .
this place just sucks .
all bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke .
they do n't even bother to take it and trash it .
the front desk people does not even smile .
this was the fastest bingo i 've ever played in my life .
she kept answering the phone and taking reservations while i was standing there waiting .
this place is a dive and i would n't stay here for free .
they also need to get that friday 's out of there .
this place sucks so bad !
in this case you may have paid too much .
could be a little better .
staff seems unfriendly .
the only bad thing about staying here would be the clientele .
worst pool ever !
buffet here is terrible on friday night seafood buffet !
crab was so dry it would n't come out of the shell !
but they did attempt to remodel their rooms .
a dingy smokey old casino .
anybody who eats here , avoid the buffet .
my daughter has been freaking out seeing her mom sick .
air quality in building is poor .
it was just plain gross and unhealthy .
selection of food is not great .
smoky old school depressing casino .
i 'm only giving this hotel _num_ starts bc their service was outstanding !
i did n't stay overnight .
and let me tell ya , i 've never seen anything like it .
the poor guy was trying .
i hate seeing employees treated so poorly .
i do n't even know why i gave two stars .
they really deserve one .
or zero .
i am done with the gold coast .
stayed there twice and was very disappointed both times .
they also gave me very poor value for my gambling dollar .
too many other better options for spending my gambling dollars .
nightmare is all i can say .
thanks but i 'll never be back .
too far from anything fun .
room smelled like smoke and wet dogs .
no fridge , hair dryer or microwave .
room service was the worst !
i got tired of waiting after _num_ min i went to subway .
no shade in pool area unless you want to pay the bar $ _num_ .
review for the casino .
so much cheese at gold coast .
the whole place feels old school .
i did go to the breakfast buffet since it was so damn cheap .
it 's really hard to beat $ _num_ bucks !
called front desk to have room changed , no one ever came up .
went down , they could care less .
gave us new room , still smelled like smoke but less .
this ruined our vacation .
once they have you there and your money , they could care less .
if you have kids , i would not stay there .
pool was terrible .
no wi-fi , no coffee for free .
if you bet maximum slots never pay .
very dirty and stinks inside of casino .
they actually taste downright awful !
that is false advertising !
also , i 've never heard of any hotel charging to use the pool .
`` the pool is provided as a complimentary service to hotel guests . ''
they must not know the meaning of the words free and complimentary !
dont stay here , its a rip off !
so for _num_ nights we end up paying for _num_ in total !
rip off !
and do n't even get me started on the lack of support from management .
i do n't particularly care for the gold coast .
terrible .
and finally , the sunday champagne buffet brunch was terrible .
some of the worst brunch i 've ever had .
ugh .
i hate this hotel .
fees .
when i get to the room it was a _num_ bed .
no i can not pay cash .
answer i will not .
the server went & told her management about this .
total bs not coming back beware of this establishment players .
no response back .
this _num_ star is too much for them .
avoid from this hotel .
terrible .
very dishonest and rude .
the worst sports book in las vegas .
so no i wo n't be back .
so yea i did n't tip him .
she made me repeat myself several times and then started laughing at me .
we immediately left and spent our money at a more reputable establishment .
same problem with the sister casino , the orleans .
the promotions are already very small but i 'm not even getting those .
my food credit is gone and my free okay is gone .
i would easily tell anyone to never go here .
place sucks .
hotel rooms smell like weed .
many local chinese are seen every day ( professional players ? )
shooting on casino floor , pool and workout center closed , and terrible service .
did n't even get our free game play .
there was a shooting just feet from us on the casino floor .
dirty carpets , small bathrooms , outdated decor .
the pool and fitness center were closed .
( weather was upper _num_ s ) .
then when i complained to the hotel , i never got a return call .
very slow internet that you are forced to pay for in the resort fee .
the problem is bug bites .
i really would want to give this budget hotel casino _num_ stars .
staff at check in and check out were very attentive .
second day there the casino area stunk of smoke and sewage .
horrible .
vegas is over priced and overrated .
never have i dealt w anything like this is my _num_ yrs of gambling .
will not be staying here again .
way to go gold coast retail .
the administration does not care about customer royalty .
not like it used to be .
the gold coast hotel in vegas is horrific .
so nasty !
i went to the service desk and the woman at the counter was horrible .
the leasing agent was a wise ass and rude .
there was also some homeless people digging through the garbage .
i could n't quite put a finger on it .
the bartender was the only person out on the floor .
also , the pizza was slightly undercooked .
both times terrible service !
second time was tonight .
i 'm so disappointed because this place is right down the street from me .
worked directly with the condescending owner , jeff carr .
not true .
strongly advise not using this classic door and trim for any building supplies .
maybe it was an off night -- who knows .
but unless you 're paying , i 'm not going back .
guess this place does n't do a lot of lunch business .
with so many better options in vegas , why would you come here ?
ok , it 's the holidays , the economy sucks , blah blah blah .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
i ca n't see how this place could possibly get more than one star .
terrible service .
decor = _num_ .
screaming match = _num_ .
if you want good kabobs there are way better places to go .
place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different .
this place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant .
sadly i 've made the effort on two occasions to visit this store .
bad business practice .
needless to say i wo n't be back .
terrible first impression .
place is not healthy .
with no remote .
police made _num_ trips here this morning alone .
i did not do my homework but again i was tired .
shady , shady , shady !
they did n't even have a model to show .
i asked what the apartment number was , they would n't tell me .
bad place to live .
the one pool has been closed for a very long time .
new management has taken over and they are doing an awful job .
do n't take your pets here .
one star is because i can not leave _num_ stars .
this operation as a whole is either severely understaffed or simply inefficient .
it 's a shame , at one time we really liked going there .
worst place ever .
they are awful .
they could n't care less .
they do n't care !
wrong !
there process is harsh on fabrics .
ruined several items and they never take the responsibility .
anyways , i am done with this place .
employees are not friendly especially the black cashier girl .
she was just lazy to do her fucking job !
customer service ummm what customer service ?
the employees are rude , unfriendly , and straight dirty !
when i go grocery shopping i kinda expect there to be groceries !
why am i reviewing a walmart ?
no one reads reviews for walmart .
but i need to get some frustration off my chest .
do note this was while i was still waiting for someone to help me !
she continued to take her time and me did n't acknowledge me at all !
she looked like she hated her job .
poor poor poor customer service !
horrible .
the managers do n't seem to care either .
some of their policy 's are ridiculous .
how difficult is it to scan items on a cash register ?
not just an item ... i can let that slide .
ugh ... writing this review is getting me heated again .
bottom line : walmart is lame !
i am exhausted , i am worked to the bone !
it has been hell today !
this is called bait and switch , this is also illegal .
i am not going to waste another second of my time dealing with walmart .
then i see all the things for cheap and i 'm like wow .
they said it was in stock at this location .
worse service ever .
and this is n't the first time i 've been neglected from their staff .
never will i ever come back this walmart .
what a nightmare .
day & night , this walmart is probably the worst in las vegas !
- extremely long checkout lines at all times .
ca n't find something ?
tough cookies because you probably wont find anyone to help you .
- they do not consistently stock the shelves .
are you kidding me ?
i bought a las vegas beach towel _num_ hours ago at the charleston store .
this time i bought pizza pockets i bit into one and it was sour .
i hate walmart .
you can hardly fit a cart in there let alone a few carts .
ugh its just wrong which ever way you look at it .
im done and never going back .
worse store in history !
the employees are the most rude associates i 've ever seen .
then when the `` manager '' came over she was even worse !
i really do n't enjoy this particular walmart location .
first of all , the service in this store is terrible .
disgusting !
major failure walmart .
the only redeeming quality is the fact that this store is two blocks away .
do not bother coming to this walmart today .
very slow cashiers and even slower customers .
only _num_ lines open .
this is crazy and rude customers .
this women 's cart was up my ass while i was trying to pay .
the guy who came back was so rude .
he said , no it does n't .
the customer service was terrible from that guy .
if it 's not in the computer they do n't have it .
just horribly run .
the site to store service here is horrific .
this station is never staffed .
customer service is terrible .
i was returning _num_ floor mats .
the wait there was over _num_ minutes .
there was only one station open .
the rep was arguing with the customer for over _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
it took another _num_ for the supervisor to come .
no one would open another station to help out .
absolutely ridiculous .
worst checkout of any walmart i have been to .
no sign of security in the lot or around the exterior of the building .
no attention paid to him by any other customers in the parking lot .
everyone is completely out for themselves and has no problem doing whatever they want .
probably the worst place in america .
horrible customer service .
she says `` no '' in an annoyed voice .
pathetic .
the worst thing about this walmart is their bathrooms !
but then again it is walmart .
they will never get better .
rude service always .
there is just no excuse .
this place is such a mess .
this is bs as managers hang out in the back talking to one another .
the workers of walmart are so unprofessional .
this was just a horrible experience all around .
this is the one of the worst walmart location in las vegas .
but i believe the service at this particular walmart is worse than most .
plus the lines are terrible and the store is never very clean .
and of course , there is a mcdonalds inside .
the service is alright but could be better .
as for me , i have switched to smiths and amazon prime .
total waste of time .
sitting here at mcdonald 's wondering how these stores even keep their doors open .
seems like they have no regard for the health and care for others .
and get mad if you ca n't hear them .
i 've used this pharmacy _num_ times and every visit has been unpleasant .
i only gave a stare because i had to to make this review .
unacceptable !
makes no sense .
the worse walmart ever !
i rather pay _num_ to a dollar more and get great customer service .
after they were bagged , walks away without assisting new cashier .
their service is unbelievable .
this walmart sucks .
was late back to work .
ugh .
now where r the managers , no where to be seen .
lanes closing , really cone on .
this walmart is the worst .
do they not want your money ?
next time i 'll be avoiding walmart and going across the street to target .
it really does not surprise me this walmart had such bad reviews online .
never contacted me .
seems to me they are just trying to avoid giving me my money back .
unorganized , bad customer service .
rude .
this is why i like sams club they have better customer service .
you ca n't get anybody to help you in the store .
this review is directed to management and corporate more than against the employees .
i shop at night to avoid long lines .
why ca n't they cross train there employees ?
a negative one star if possible .
maybe they do n't even care .
seems like a low class walmart .
paying out of pocket .
her skin looked like a leather couch .
no wonder .
the phone kept ringing and ringing , so no manager .
i went to this walmart with the sole purpose of picking up some jewelry .
the overall experience was a giant waste of my time and efforts .
why is your management not doing anything to stop this ?
this is one reason i no longer carry cash .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
the bacon was like beef jerky .
not crispy .
the biscuit minus gravy was a bit dry .
gravy is the only solution .
the homemade corned beef has was meh .
it was just shredded corned beef brisket with some potatoes .
the hash browns are also a bit soggy .
tasted like angel food cake batter was used to make the pancakes .
i did n't realize this place was a chain .
the sausage was overcooked as well .
i did like the pancakes , the eggs , and the ham .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
it took us ten minutes to be seated .
for my meal , i ordered pot roast .
over _num_ % of it was fat .
the service was the worst part .
from start to finish , the waitress was surly and rude .
i could n't wait to bolt out of there .
there are better diners in this city .
their steak was absolutely disgusting !
it was extremely hard to cut through , especially since it was so thin .
it was mainly gristle , and no meat .
it had so much fat , very bland , and dry .
there were no croutons , cheese , and their was barely any onions .
i really wanted this diner to work out , but it did n't .
... ... ... .
by such system this place is barely better than mcdonald 's .
what i got was room temperature , soggy , fried cinnamon bread .
where this place fell flat for me , is the food .
so half of my experience was missing .
ordered eggs benedict and the eggs were cold when my plate came to me .
the burger has no seasoning .
the fries are overcooked .
horrid service , cold , bland tasteless food .
the sausage gravy was so disgusting !
this was the worst food i have had in a long time !
_num_ star is _num_ too many !
sad story now ... .
keep in mind , i 'm young & my boyfriend is young .
not the normal ticket time for black bear .
candy never apologized .
but that was still about _num_ minutes after we got it .
but nothing special about black bear .
what a disaster that was .
worse yet , we took friends and things did not go well .
this visit was disgusting !
the first night i came , i was by myself , and starving .
neither of us felt like cooking , so we stopped in .
_num_ minutes is too long to wait , even in a busy restaurant .
that was really the only stellar part of my meal .
corned beef hash was not good .
not even like it could have been helped .
it was not good .
however , i had a horrible experience there .
my friend ordered the stuffed chicken and i ordered the chicken fried steak .
her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm .
my chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well .
the waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing .
i only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing .
the cake was kind of dry .
however , we spent two hours in that diner !
steak was cooked correctly but was cold upon arrival .
hash browns were mediocre .
a busser greeted us at the door and walked us to a booth .
anyways she really did n't try to fix the situation .
enough for me to give this place a second try sometime down the road .
service was fast and friendly however food was cold where next to plate .
i 've been to this restaurant before a couple times and had ok experiences .
but it 's not close to where i live .
i ca n't see returning .
server was rushed .
tasted like instant potatoes .
peas in chicken pot pie were canned as well .
i ordered the chicken fried steak because some of the reviews were glowing .
it was horrible , my tea was horrible .
all four were raw and cold .
the pancakes were the only thing on the table worth eating .
they have your traditional american breakfast , lunch , and dinner items .
if i could give no stars , i would .
not buying it .
so , this is a yelp find led wrong .
they have hundreds of reviews and _num_ stars ... not sure why .
overall , just not good food .
nothing great but not terrible either .
i will not be returning or recommend the black bear diner .
however , this location is not up to par with the others .
after quite a while , the server delivered a chinese chicken salad .
i explained that the salad was not a caesar .
i did n't eat it and she refused to take it off the bill .
you see hundreds of bears everywhere ( weird ) .
the green carpet was stained everywhere ( please replace your carpet ) .
mediocre .
everything felt so heavy that i felt guilty for hours afterwards .
the highlight was my freshly squeezed orange juice , it was the bomb !
meeting our waitress was n't much more pleasant .
some sort of acknowledgement would be nice that i spoke to you .
the green beans were way overpowered by the onions in them .
again , my husband and i just felt like an inconvenience to them .
there is supposed to be a new location opening in henderson this fall .
what a disappointment .
i ordered the california burger with cole slaw .
my husband the chicken fried steak .
it was barely warm .
i could n't find the hamburger patty under all the lettuce .
no cheese and the bun was a little stale .
the cole slaw was very vinegary .
and to top it off , my drink refill was wrong .
this place is quantity over quality .
the line cooks do n't know scrambled eggs from an omelette .
boring chicken fried steak patty .
one word disgusting !
our hash browns were completely still raw and the eggs were rubber !
so you have a good cook station and a bad one ?
and says well it 's a `` country fried steak '' .
i do n't care for this spot .
the service is iffy and the food is hit or miss .
breakfast served all day unlike most other breakfast spots in town .
i really ca n't say i enjoyed our late afternoon breakfasts .
the coffee here in my opinion sucks .
that 's a big no no with me .
lol oh well , i struggled through my breakfast washing it down with coffee .
i 'm not signing up .
the hash browns were extremely bland and also undercooked .
they just missed the mark everywhere .
tried this place out .
nothing special .
ca n't stand bad service .
service was horrible !
service was horrible !
both of us had to season our plate 3x 's .
horribly slow service .
worst food i 've had in a while .
very bland no seasoning .
grilled veggie total mush over cooked .
only edible on plate was backed potato .
the food was alright , nothing to brag about .
what a waste of $ _num_ for one person to eat breakfast .
also , she was inappropriate with her stories of her private life .
i do n't mind small talk , but there is a limit .
ca n't really go wrong with this place .
ate the mash potatoes .
my boyfriend and i were told it would take about _num_ mins .
she had us down for michael party of _num_ .
same name but party of _num_ .
but no .
terrible .
_num_ minutes and no one has come to ask for drinks .
it 's upsetting because the food here is good but the service really sucked !
horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management !
we will never return or recommend .
worst service in my life and we spent $ _num_ !
if i could they would not get _num_ star !
the waitress was not very attentive .
she did not check on us or let us know food was almost done .
the poached eggs were cooked correctly .
the waitress did not check if the food was okay .
they charge $ _num_ per glass .
skip it .
but ultimately it comes down to service and ours was not up to par .
was wasted $ _num_ .
the food was salty , bland and watery .
excuse me ?
my kids got pancakes and they unfortunately were hard although they were large .
the salads was boring .
it was lettuce , carrots , tomatoes and the dressing .
will not go back , at least not for breakfast .
ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead .
our waitress immediately had it corrected .
however , both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning .
overall , just not that great as i was hoping for better .
i really wish i could give these crooks less stars .
i am charged an an additional $ _num_ in bullshit fees .
oh wait , ca n't do that .
wonder why that is ?
this place is owned and operated by total crooks .
seriously , do not use this company !
i do n't know how this is legal .
been told _num_ min _num_ min ago .
the worst experience of my life !
do n't even have waiting chair to sit in !
this place is horrible .
the older gentleman behind the desk has no clue .
feels like sort of bad horror movie around here .
the worst towing company i 've ever faced .
this is the worst experience i 've ever had with a business .
they make a bad situation even worse .
i feel very terrible that someone yelled at me on the phone .
customer service is below _num_ .
awful customer service .
horrible experience .
there 's no reason to be like that to a customer .
friend grabbed some mexican from the place next door .
it just was n't going to play .
all in all , not impressed .
wo n't be back .
money plays lost my respect and trust last night .
had no understanding of what a customer represents .
just got kicked out of this place due to a negative yelp .
it 's our fault for coming here and giving the place a 3rd chance .
you lost money & patrons .
the worst management i have ever come in contact with .
i expressed my shock by telling him that he was n't being fair .
my bf and i brushed off what happened since it happened months ago .
could n't get the time of day from bartenders on multiple occasions .
saw dr. shannon chandler for an exam and contact lenses .
apparently they do n't make enough doing so .
used to be you could trust doctors .
after his examination , a staff member told him to pick out his frames .
we spent $ _num_ dollars for an attitude and terrible service .
quality of lenses at this place are a joke and over priced .
the doctor refused to see us because we were ten minutes late .
do not go here if you enjoy being respected .
card , which by the way is a ton of money !
i probably wo n't come back here .
terrible customer service .
that 's unacceptable .
she raised her voice telling me she 's uncomfortable serving me .
i do n't care , there was no one else in the store .
then she puts the tuna scoop back in the bin to reserve .
again , no wonder this location is empty all the time .
too bad you ca n't give zero stars with your review .
long story short they said it would be fixed .
there are constant problems that never seem to get solved .
this april or _num_ they went off three times in five days .
the first incident happened at 7am and lasted almost four hours .
management was totally unhelpful and gave us false information about the alarm company .
worst experience of my life !
i just wan na start off by saying fuck anne and robin .
i just wan na know when were you planning on telling us robin !
she said it was $ _num_ extra because she did n't get approved !
flat out wrong and disrespectful in how she speaks to tenants there .
the house we rented was in very poor condition .
i would highly recommend staying away from this management company if at all possible .
do not waste your time with these people .
they are soo dumb .
they do n't know their own property that they are renting .
so now i have to work through this problem .
my youngest is _num_ months old ppl !
just stay away , just say no !
i am only giving them _num_ star because i have to .
do not rent from this company .
they are rude and very unprofessional .
that 's your own damn problem , not mine .
this is the worst property management company i 've ever come in contact with .
if you are able , stay away from renting from them .
just another reason why you should n't rent from this company .
these people need to be shut down - seriously .
these people are not running a business - they are running a scam .
please be especially careful to stay away from cindy and becky !
unprofessional and rude .
they beat me for the _num_ cleaning fee .
by far the worst place i have ever rented from .
all with broken english might i add .
instead of receiving my deposit , they sent me a bill .
do not rent from here .
i 've already had numerous issues .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
i have never been treated so bad in my life .
they even treated my best friend and daughter like crap .
the house i moved into was dirty , my list goes on .
umc quick care ... ... ... ... two things wrong with the name .
wrong !
very disappointed in the medical care here .
dr lee was the dr for my two sons .
the dr left us in the room for _num_ minutes and never came back .
all we want is them to feel better so they can eat .
she replied with `` i feed my kids before i come '' .
this is the worst dr i 've been to in _num_ years .
patients coming by every _num_ mins asking to be seen .
omg this place is a nightmare !
the staff are rude and would not recommend this place to anybody .
i done fell asleep twice and still have n't been seen .
i will never go back to a umc quick care .
they r a complete joke !
dont bother .
do n't waste your time .
in fact i would rather die than try to use umc ever again .
first i called to check see how long the wait is .
then they bring me back to a room to meet the doctor .
i will not wait any longer .
refund my money .
disgusting !
they completely screwed mine up and will give me no help whatsoever .
worst service my girlfriend and i ever had .
there 's no steps to their service and no customer service at all .
they were n't busy and still had to wait _num_ hours .
no big deal , doc will approve .
well here it is _num_ days later no approval !
only _num_ months .
i will go in get `` examined '' get my updated prescriptions and leave .
i strongly suggest that umc look at this matter .
ugh so i call ahead because i broke my neck .
_num_ hour update : still sitting in the room .
they 're just sitting around chatting behind the counter .
dr. lee is the worst doctor in the world .
this is something that should be advised upon check in .
urgent care means that we want to be seen relatively quickly .
i could have gone somewhere else to be seen with a shorter wait time .
came here last friday ( april _num_ ) .
it was n't that busy so i did n't wait long .
i told him about my symptoms and how it got worse .
he just explained to me that it will get worse before it gets better .
do n't go here save your money cause these people do n't care !
waste of time and money !
the waiting room smelled like mold and the seats were a little too close .
never in my life have i ever heard that .
like i am his daughter and i simply do n't understand .
let alone the fact that this is just a quick care is ridiculous .
the employee informed me `` any minute now '' the delivery guy already left .
the employee was rude and short and gave no explanation or apology .
10:30 wrong pizza delivered again , pineapple and ham ?
the second time i did n't bother calling back .
i like papa 's usually but this one really fell short of late !
it 's not rocket science .
she was going to charge me anyways !
i could not believe the poor customer service !
called to place an order for deliver _num_ minutes ago .
worst customer service !
i said `` miss , you 're not alone .
she said current wait time was an hour to an hour and a half .
and then added they are really busy because of school lunches .
if you ca n't handle the volume , do n't take it on . ''
pizza is still not here btw ... do n't use this store !
business 's are completely allowed to do things like that .
she was rude from the moment she started talking .
i then went back to the email ( and read every last word .
so there was no way to know of this policy before ordering .
until yesterday , i 'd never had a bad experience with this location .
_num_ minutes later , i called to find out where my food was .
its been sitting for _num_ minutes . ''
well excuse me .
its still going to be cold when it gets here , you idiot .
what gets me , is that i did n't even get an apology .
never again , not if i can help it .
incompetent reps taking phone orders .
could n't get my order correct after _num_ tries .
he actually hung up on me and i called back .
the staff sucks .
usually they will deliver if you explain how terrible this location is .
they do n't even deserve a star .
the phone staff is extremely rude and unhelpful .
no big deal , so i decided to call .
i called stating the problem and that i would like to order for carryout .
all i received was attitude that they ca n't do that for me .
not worth the headache .
call this pizza for getting yourself the best insult in the city .
do n't get it here .
needless to say the chicken and pizzas were cold .
ridiculous .
this place sucks and has crappy pizza and customer service .
i 've never been a fan and always preferred pizza hut .
terrible costumer service .
only giving one star because zero was n't an option .
the lady i spoke to was rude .
never rent a property from this management company .
they run a very shady business and will do anything to pocket your money .
i would recommend renting from any other property management company other than this one .
worst service ever !
within a week the down stairs unit went out after upstairs unit was fixed .
and service is _num_ days later .
within a week the down stairs unit went out after upstairs unit was fixed .
and service is _num_ days later .
just spent $ _num_ on chemicals .
_num_ transaction atm fee .
bad decision - the a/c was barely on , seemed like it was off .
outside was _num_ degrees .
lame imax theater !
do n't even get me started about the rude little kids that work here .
i will never waste my time to drive all the way out here again .
there 's also no butter dispenser for your popcorn .
i argued with him saying that this was a coupon and he refused .
they screwed my husband and i over big time .
`` went to your theaters tonight to see a movie and guess what ?
left almost a half hour later without seeing anything .
we told him to do a split payment and it was still supposedly declined .
it took over _num_ minutes for your manager to show up .
we all sat in awkward silence for _num_ minutes .
but ... why would we ever go back ?
our entire evening was ruined .
would score zero stars if the app allowed .
it was so painful many people sat with their fingers in their ears .
some people complained but the staff was not helpful .
if you go , be sure to pack ear plugs .
places do not take long in las vegas to become old and forgettable .
the concessions are terrible , not in the choices but in the quality .
i have tried there slush drinks , pretzels , nachos etc .
i would much rather go to sunset way better .
lame !
minutes went by , and they just stayed on .
15-20 minutes after the show started , the lights finally went off .
bad customer service .
no way to contact them without physically going there .
bad form .
worst customer service ever .
excuse me ?
as we walked off they kept running their mouth .
the line outside is confusing and nobody stand up to explain !
the seating in the theaters , however , is extremely uncomfortable to me .
so i tell the girl `` hey i just wanted the popcorn and coke .
the cashier seems to hate working there and is extremely rude .
so upset .
now is _num_ pm , movie supposed to start _num_ minutes ago .
so far no previous , no music , no excuses .
slow service .
nasty ass restaurant .
i do n't understand why they 're still open .
edit : they just called guest _num_ .
i 'm _num_ .
still no food .
been _num_ minutes since i last posted .
edit _num_ : food was cold when it came .
do n't wo n't waste your time inside if you 're in a hurry .
dining room staff is extremely slow .
this is the worst fast food place here .
i felt like i was staying at a motel _num_ .
the first room they gave us had old , dirty carpet and walls .
the front desk checkin personnel was not very friendly and lacked customer service .
it is off the strip , about a _num_ minute drive .
close to the strip , grocery stores , and local malls .
they also had a _num_ hr pool which is pretty cool .
service was absolutely the worst of any place i 've ever been .
the channel selection was extremely limited .
this was my birthday trip and we spent little time in the place .
the tub was too small for two people .
stay in a motel _num_ or other upscale place , this place sucks .
i went through expedia to book this hotel .
if it 's hot outside , it 's also hot in the hallways .
housekeeping service was not offered to us since we only stayed for _num_ nights .
it was dated , dirty and there was only warm water .
ew , no !
not really any amenities , no restaurants bar , etc .
staff was so-so , depending in who was at the desk .
nice room , but it looks like the whole resort is slowly going downhill .
they have one of the worst fold out beds i have ever slept upon .
it promised free wifi , it only worked in the lobby .
the pool was not memorable or good .
the air conditioning was so extremely loud .
the walls were paper thin and we heard the people next door .
did n't enjoy my stay here nearly as much as i hoped .
what a mistake to base it on that .
we also realized that the front desk person was also the concierge .
the furniture and furnishings were outdated .
my wife and i did n't even sit down .
my wife turned and stated , `` i 'm not staying here '' .
i immediately called the westin and fortunately they were able to accommodate us .
i 'm never staying here again .
this hotel is pretty sad .
the gym is terrible the pool is ehh .
just not what i expected .
bad bad .
stayed here for my birthday after looking on the website .
what a waste of money !
nasty dirty room and then there was roaches .
we complained to the manager and she just smiled and did nothing about it .
telling everyone i know to stay away !
room pictures in the website do not match with the room !
just like the burger you get always not the same as it was advertised .
what we get was not worth the money we pay for !
i am not high maintenance and do n't usually care where i stay .
unable get a better rest .
anyway next time i 'll book elsewhere in las vegas .
avoid their concierge service if you can .
they do n't really care about helping you .
so if i were u dont even attempt to stay here .
the property management is terrible and rude !
once they get your money , they do n't care about you anymore .
when we got on the bus , the gas was on 1/4 tank .
will probably never stay here again !
this place is where nightmares are made .
they screwed me into signing up for a year .
id just gotten out of a _num_ year relationship .
i hate it here , someone kill me .
negative stars !
horrible customer service .
_num_ people in line _num_ tellers at _num_ in the morning .
they did , i closed my accounts .
they do not want you in their branch .
she was too busy picking at her fingers to continue counting my cash .
i have been a boa customer for over _num_ years .
never enough tellers here .
the line is backed up an there 's only one teller .
you wait forever ... the service is ok but the wait is ridiculous .
this bank has gone down as well .
this whole banking chain is going down hill may have to switch banks shortly .
pitiful .
no stars .
worst experience ever .
this branch is famous for long wait times .
poor answer when customers are trying to bring money to their business .
not her fault but still very inconvenient .
is available today rather then just ordering a debit card for me .
the customer service has been quickly going downhill !
this bank fucking sucks do not go here .
this is bullshit and i will not be returning .
absolutely horrendous customer service and complete waste of day everytime i come here .
i wish i could give you idiots _num_ stars .
_num_ people in line for the teller and only _num_ teller window open .
you have been warned .
management is rude and very unprofessional .
this place sucks .
they would n't even give me a refund after this ordeal .
i do not recommend this place .
highly unprofessional and unsatisfied .
just awful , personnel were helpful , but the service was terrible .
owner is not responsible at all .
there was some good and some bad .
the bad : the place could really use an update .
they did serve their purpose though .
it was hella slow .
yelp reviews were pretty accurate on this place .
rather she was quite rude and said `` what ?
she was n't very anything except rude .
so , beware of the receptionist with two surface piercing on her collar bone .
overall , it was horrible .
and no one cared really .
living social deal , $ _num_ for _num_ races .
i 'd never gone before , and i was quite scared at first .
do n't ask me why .
they state the obvious like ok red is stop green is go .
dont press them at the same time blah blah .
go for it , they dont give a shit .
slow drivers ?
waste your time behind them , they dont care .
we timed all _num_ races and each was _num_ minutes on the button .
-- this is a lie like none other !
lame !
so we left and they lost out on $ _num_ !
the girl at the desk sucks on getting and keeping business for this place !
make sure you have reservations and still plan on waiting _num_ hours !
one of the worst experiences i ever had .
seriously do n't go not worth the groupon price .
if you are using a groupon , no reservations are taken .
this place is very unprofessional .
wish i could give _num_ stars .
lost my business forever !
we have requested a refund from groupon and will never go back !
this place left me with a sour taste in my mouth .
you probably just got a fast cart .
it just felt really unorganized & unprofessional .
that 's no way to spend your vacation time .
just not well run .
the staff was extremely slow .
we visit vegas quite often and we wo n't return to race here .
i was a bit disappointed with many things .
i will probably not go here again .
otherwise , i would n't even bother .
pole position .
first off they have horrible customer service .
the staff here was very not polite .
the lady at the desk was rude .
then she said pole position would be better for the kids .
i guess they do n't need the money that i was going to spend .
which would have been like two hundred dollars .
just go to pole position that 's what the girl at the desk says .
used the groupon , wo n't make that mistake again .
do not bother !
do n't support this venue .
terrible terrible customer service .
what a disappointment and waste of an afternoon on my short weekend vacation .
fast lap is not worth the money .
secondly the staff was rude , probably another reason they were empty .
he let the staff and management know and they really did n't care .
horrible place never go here !
the staff did not care and did not help at all .
place is disgusting and a waste of money go to pole position .
front desk staff were extremely unprofessional and unhelpful .
it is an absolute joke , not to mention a huge safety hazard .
i can not recommend this place until they maintain their equipment properly .
you 've been warned .
if i could rate this place a zero star i would .
so now two hours have passed and we are still not racing .
i experienced some horrible customer service but never this bad !
this is for sure the worst business there can be ... .
i 'm sorry that you could n't except my honest truth about your service .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
unfortunately i purchased a pair of shoes had them for a few days .
it was not my problem the policy was not stated on the receipt .
ripoff !
ripoff !
rude !
no absolutely not .
i can get better shoes elsewhere .
same thing with the iron and iron board .
zero stars .
horrible .
all the fixtures , furniture , `` art '' etc is outdated .
bring your own linen , cooking supplies , toilet paper etc .
stupid .
i planned on staying a few weeks but could barely handle one weeks .
i felt just so nasty staying there .
i look at weekly apartments completely different after that experience .
they can careless since they are almost full .
he will help you out and not get out of his character like sally .
makes this budget suite look like a circus .
do n't believe me ?
disgusting place .
the man does nothing but sit in the office on the computer .
i do not recommend !
with online school that needed to get done , it was quite frustrating !
only one device worked and not well .
calling front desk is useless for this issue .
next pet peeve is the laundromat .
dryers hardly worked .
someone stole my laundry basket too .
i would not recommend this company to anyone considering an alarm system .
all alarm companies do the same thing .
worst customer service ever .
first , there 's nowhere to get food in this place ?
pool that 's never open ?
do n't even get me started .
avoid the rio at all costs .
my first impression stepping into this place was roughly _num_ .
strangely , they painted parts of the bottom of the pool yellow and orange .
it just made the pool look dirty , if you 'd ask me .
the hotel switched their room , but did n't do much else .
what a nightmare !
alas , not true .
had to stay here for a conference , and the rooms suck balls .
i guess this hotel just got really ghetto over time .
man , this hotel is boring .
has no fun shows , fancy restaurants , and shopping malls .
why they make it too small .
also , location sucks .
most importantly , the slot machines in this hotel never ever pay back .
i lost a lot of money in here .
i did n't stay here -- - i came here for penn and teller .
there are people waiting but no shuttle .
so , we sit down and assume that it will arrive any minute .
there is no line .
lots of people get off .
plenty get on ... but not us !
this was my fourth ( and last ) stay at the rio .
especially when the room i 'm staying in is over $ _num_ a night .
too bad they had dried orange juice on them .
i guess i 'm just not a girl that likes leftovers .
point taken rio .
i stayed at the rio with a conference in july .
there were always long lines at reception and concierge .
a cab would 've been easier and worth the money .
stayed there for business , and felt they do not care about customers .
front desk was rude .
haha the valet was friendly .
i think this is the only hotel in las vegas with tube televisions .
yeah right , fool was trying to make me slip him a _num_ .
anyways , the room hella sucked .
what the hell ?
the shower head was horrible .
i just hated this place to save a few bucks .
first off , i was disappointed by our room .
we were approached by the same _num_ year old lady like _num_ times .
it got very annoying though .
personally , i ca n't recommend this place .
literally , a run around .
no idea .
from a business trip perspective , this place was major fail .
this should have been done a long time ago , not last week .
excuse me ?
excuse me ?
we charge by ounce '' how cheap are you rio ?
looking to make a dollar off of me in any way ?
strike _num_ !
seriously what am i paying $ _num_ a night for ?
you can find a much better deal in vegas .
how do they get away with calling this place an all suites hotel ?
you could not watch tv from the sofa or the beds comfortably .
so annoying .
the carpet was coming up , the wallpaper was peeling off .
it was the only thing in there , how could you miss that ?
so do n't expect too much from this place .
i wo n't be back to stay .
the `` uniforms '' of the waitresses serving you drinks were borderline stripper outfits .
ick .
bad casino .
bad starbucks .
rio made me sick !
i literally would start to gag when i walked through the gaming floor !
there was a broken towel bar in our master bath .
and please do n't get me going on the lack of internet .
this and the former italian place both remain empty .
the shops are crappy .
even by vegas standards , this place takes cheesy to a new level .
-no shuttle from the airport !
-the gym costs money !
probably would n't stay there again .
horrible !
we called around 3pm and no success .
wasted our first day in vegas !
it did n't even feel like we were in vegas .
this place surely was a mistake !
called in earlier in the evening about our bathroom having this foul sewer smell .
waited about an hour and a half , no one came .
never really got a sorry from them .
the customer service sucks at the rio .
but the hotel itself is not in the best shape .
gross .
all i 'm thinking is i hope that was n't vomit or urine .
it was probably just a/c fluid .
also , the food places in here take forever to get food out .
lots of kids and ugly people .
the room was big , in some ways it seemed too big .
you could see from caesar 's all they way past mandalay bay .
the television was old school , and the picture was rather crappy .
the casino was n't all that impressive .
it was n't very fancy and it was n't very large either .
friendly staff ( that i encountered ) .
pool was overly crowded and the water was nasty looking .
raw sewage smell in the casino near all the shops .
the hotel needs some cosmetic attention , and the room decor was dated .
nothing special caught my eye .
even the tacos were horrible .
i mean , how do you really mess up ice cream ?
also , it 's $ _num_ for a day pass to the gym .
rooms are definitely not as big as they 're made out to be .
they have monthly free poolside concerts , yay .
they have no consideration for the disabled , boo .
also the hotel had no water for _num_ minutes while i was there .
no , i 'm on vacation you run the freakin ' show .
and wireless does n't work .
built in _num_ and lightly remodeled twice since .
unless your convention is at the rio i would n't stay at the rio .
( exaggeration ) but you have to walk forever to get down there .
poker room is n't even a room .
last gripe atm 's charge $ _num_ plus _num_ % .
that 's stupid .
hotel layout is not so great .
the diamond card members are allowed to go first .
she was no longer a diamond club member so she did n't have one .
she was mainly embarrassed because this happened in front of a lot of people .
worst .
stay away from this hotel - far , far away .
so , long story short ?
do n't stay at the rio .
[ ... lackluster ... ] yay .
we hopped the shuttle back to the strip where the action was .
an utterly unremarkable experience .
i am not rating the casino .
i am rating the buffet .
no idea .
worst vegas decision ever .
i have no idea who would pay _num_ for it .
my boyfriend and i stayed at the rio this past weekend .
anyway we checked into a non-smoking room that had a king size bed .
the room was very spacious .
the bad news : the walls are paper thin !
the carpet had some fruit punch looking stains .
the bed was also the most uncomfortable bed we 've ever slept on .
the pillows were also very uncomfortable .
the check in lines were insanely long .
there were about _num_ out of _num_ stations with employees checking people in .
it was almost impossible to get a refill on our drinks .
next time we will not skimp or try to save a few bucks .
it 's not worth it .
i will not come back again .
poor service especially the manager .
the manager was having a poor attitude .
he even said that he did n't promise it , just his staff .
his attitude made me feel terrible in this vegas trip .
rio needs to upgrade itself .
no fans or air conditioning in bathrooms .
seafood buffet is good but hotel guests should get priority seating .
given that it was 4th of july weekend , i was expecting some delays .
_num_ ) paper thin walls .
i 'm talking rice paper thin , son !
_num_ ) black and white tube tv .
terrible .
it does n't matter where you stay .
i wo n't be back .
sliders from the restaurant were ok .
going here with $ _num_ would only last me a few hands .
the pool is really nice , but why are all the pools not heated ?
only an _num_ number to make reservations .
fail .
terrible , awful , nasty hotel , restaurants and service !
comedy was awful also !
received an almost empty shampoo one day instead of a full one .
it was my boyfriend and me so our passes should have cost _num_ bucks .
why would i pay _num_ bucks to eat at a buffet ?
one room same problem no hot water .
my room , when i checked in the lady asked me king bed ?
no free gym , $ _num_ a day .
and for the comfy bed and good nights sleep they get one star !
no free wifi .
the smoke in the casino is horrible .
the video check-out will not account for the drink package at all .
gee , i wonder how ethical that is .
avoid this dump .
come on , all that $ and ca n't even upgrade to flat screens ?
not so much .
overall service was just so-so ( except for the spa ) .
too many hotels in vegas to put up with attitude .
the front desk person appeared not to care .
we all know that by `` suite '' the rio really means big room .
not a room with a separate bedroom and living area .
it 's amazing how just one poor employee can ruin it for a business .
the seafood buffet restaurant was meh .
- again , the outdated rooms could have been better .
- shuttle system was n't spectacular , either .
no gambling as the cheapest black jack table was $ _num_ min .
too expensive for a monday evening .
f off !
it is off strip - but barely ( by car or taxi ) .
what is not so great : the staff attitude and food quality is mediocre .
maybe my expectations of the rio are outdated , just like their room decor .
plus for having an empty fridge for personal items .
maybe check out gold coast next door if you 're looking for cheaper tables .
so why only _num_ stars ?
yep , $ _num_ hold !
we 've contacted our bank and are still unsure of the actual amount held .
the room itself was pretty clean , but the hallways were just gross .
they would leave food sitting outside of the rooms for an entire day .
you never know if its join to be okay or or not .
or maybe the ventilation just needs cleaning .
the once great world buffet now has become a thing of our past .
rio , methinks we wo n't be visiting you anytime soon .
maybe _num_ years ago it was fabulous , but not anymore .
our room was not the most modern , but we could deal with that .
the fact that the room was not clean was a deal breaker .
the clerk actually goes to get the manager when i yelled back .
manager shows up with _num_ keys for our now second room .
total time for check in : _num_ hours .
we did n't bother to drop a dime in the casino either .
this hotel is old , dingy , and needs to be renovated asap !
i felt like i was in reno , instead of las vegas ... .
old , dingy , smells like cigarettes .
this place needs to be renovated badly .
i have stayed at the rio several times over the past few years .
plus , it smelled pretty musty and the windows were filthy .
fail on that for sure .
it is not worth the money !
i 'm going to try paris or planet hollywood next time we go .
hate this hotel .
generally overpriced in every fashion ( even for vegas ) .
sub-par quality .
the `` suite '' did have one of those newer coffee machines , however .
unfortunately , we could n't locate the coffee .
at best , the water in our `` suite '' shower reached lukewarm .
i called maintenance and the front desk requesting assistance .
we never saw anyone come up , and the problem continued .
seriously ?
it is expensive because , hey , it 's vegas .
i have never been so disappointed .
old freaking furniture & tv .
outdated .
would not stay here again .
security staff were assholes as well .
ugh .
this place is dirty and old inside .
the parking structure is no where near the casino .
they charge for everything and i mean everything .
the internet was crazy expensive at _num_ per day .
they give you two queen size beds and two towels which is ridiculous .
this was very outdated like the couch .
_num_ a day for wi-fi .
line for the front desk took _num_ minutes .
off the strip , but the shuttle at least comes in handy .
no the rudeness from the employees sets the tone for the entire property .
the line at check-in was _num_ minutes long and only _num_ counters were attended .
what , are they afraid i am going to steal it ?
called concierge to get answers to some questions just before 9pm on night _num_ .
horrible sewage smell outside that did not go away .
ours , luckily , worked as intended .
suffice it to say , we will not be returning to the rio .
skip this place .
worst hotel ever !
i noticed the place is very old ( kinda dirty looking ) .
the remote does n't even work .
after all those problems of the room , we were very unhappy .
so my boyfriend went to the front desk and complain .
so there was nothing we can do but deal with the dirty room situation .
there were probably _num_ or _num_ people behind the front desk not doing anything .
she was like , '' no .
so we dropped off the keys and left !
the only benefit to this place was that it was a good deal .
will not be staying here again .
if you lose your life savings you can not get your money back .
why did n't anyone tell me that families like to stay here ?
the walls are not very thick .
this is overall not a bad place .
it 's really cheap , and the rooms are big .
if you want an extra roll out bed , it will be $ _num_ .
you were either freezing your dick off , or sweating balls .
the view was crap .
i lost a shit ton of money playing games of the adult variety .
on the plus side : _num_ $ from a slot machine !
do n't you know that these are the real quiet hours in vegas ?
but we did n't have to look far for agreement .
worse hotel i 've ever stayed in .
they could n't do anything to get us a different room .
but no !
what a waste of time !
we 're not and those damn pictures of half naked guys everywhere gets irritating .
`` suites '' ) were outdated and dirty beyond belief .
we opted for the main buffet .
there were many food choices from the very basic to the fairly stylish .
the quality was higher than other buffets i 've seen .
the wait was ridiculously long .
the seating and `` service '' were totally absurd .
everything about the room was so tired , worn out and dirty .
curtains were badly stained ( i do n't wan na know ) .
desperately needs an update of the rooms and ventilation .
also , would be nice to have the pool open later .
roach spotted in ladies room closest to the big seafood buffet .
i do not smoke and felt like i consumed a pack a day .
hallways dirty , food outside rooms kept there for days .
spend more money and stay somewhere better !
poor .
just like college , except without a door to put underneath .
wo n't be coming back .
this is the second time i 've stayed at the rio in ten years .
the representative at the ticket box office was very rude .
i have never had a worse experience at a hotel .
it 's not worth it to go to their buffet either .
the rio is an overpriced waste of time and money !
for $ _num_ a night you can go anywhere else and be better off .
gross .
very disappointing !
do you want a boarding pass for your flight home ?
to top things off , the people who work there are very rude .
i will not return to this hotel .
it simply was not worth it .
so glad i only stayed here for a night !
i stayed here the first night in vegas and actually felt bored !
ok i am probably being too extreme , but still !
$ _num_ for one day ?
such a disappointment .
check-in was slow .
otherwise you would have stood in line for nothing .
free shuttle to strip comes every _num_ min .
the only thing that appeared clean ( thankfully ) was the bed .
but even that was not comfortable .
highly disappointed .
all the beds were n't made including the couch .
no clean towels , trash everywhere .
at 7pm , the room should have been made .
they charge $ _num_ for in room coffee .
breakfast cafe was n't open til 8am .
there are so many better options on the strip .
do not buy any coupon or deal for this hotel , ( ie .
living social / groupon / etc . )
the value of each coupon was for $ _num_ each .
and customer service is not their concern .
that said , the one thing i felt when i stayed there was tired .
most of the better places to stay are a very short cab ride away .
okay , so the rio sucks !
nope , if you want coffee , it costs _num_ bucks !
i do n't even think motel _num_ does that !
second , the elevators suck .
not like you can walk up and down _num_ flights of stairs !
third , the rooms are totally dated and not very clean .
fourth , ate breakfast at the breakfast cafe and it sucked .
not one of the drinks i received was an actual mai tai !
oh , and the slot machines suck too .
i probably lost $ _num_ bucks on the stupid slots there .
that would have been a much better option .
just not what we expected .
i called about the toilet and got told to call back .
just pathetic of a major hotel in vegas .
i would say it 's like a holiday inn - basic but nothing special .
the sofa and chairs were stained .
someone was greeting people & discussing money every _num_ hours .
horrible night 's sleep .
and thanksgiving turkey was a chopped loaf .
just think of it as discounted price = no customer service !
the room was large which was expected because all their rooms were suites .
the restroom was very basic .
nothing to brag about .
the plumbing for the two sinks need some work .
wifi was not complementary and the tv channels were very limited .
is n't this a fire hazard ?
wtf ?
the main floor is very large but dank place .
bed was uncomfortable - it dipped in the middle .
bad idea .
it was okay ... .
first night we got there the room was not that much clean .
the next day was a little bit better .
quite possibly the worst hotel in las vegas .
starting with a short ( for lv ) checkin line that takes _num_ minutes .
two days later someone else gets keys to my room !
they reset my key , not theirs .
i cant get in my room .
security takes _num_ minutes to let me in my room .
overall the entire experience could n't be worse .
probably the worse lv hotel i 've ever experienced hands down .
false advertisement !
do not go here thinking you 'll get a cheap buffet .
it 's regardless there is an event or not .
this was absolutely the worst hotel experience i have ever had .
it is getting a bit long in the tooth ... time for a facelift .
room service trays were left in the hallway all day .
elevators were slow and some not working at all .
we 'll be staying elsewhere on our next visit .
the rooms are all suites here , which is nice .
this was an aweful experience , ill never stay here again .
if you do n't smoke , do n't stay here .
you wo n't find me coming back again .
took my fiance here for her birthday weekend and her first time in vegas .
after complaining to the front desk , we got assigned a new room .
did n't find any , but what i found was equally disgusting .
will stay elsewhere from now on .
there was mold around the bathtub .
the bad : extremely poor value for money , in my opinion .
want to print out your boarding pass for the flight home ?
well , normal checkout is 11am ( ?
so should you choose this casino over others at it 's price point ?
lumpy mattress and a bed that sinks in the middle .
room tip : best tip - do n't come to the rio .
as with anything in las vegas , you pay for what you get .
no fan in bathroom , sinks do n't drain , fridge does n't work .
no problem !
there was one named oscar that was just spectacular and he deserves a raise !
why would you have room cleaning if they do n't do actual cleaning ?
plus it was super slow and not worth the price .
their machines are tight too , no such thing as a loose machine here .
no fast food , at least .
the rest was pricey , including the cafe that was only open for breakfast .
unbelievable .
i stood in line for an hour to get my keys .
no biggie to me .
however , i can complain about the state of our room .
he was also by himself and and this was a _num_ person job .
the room was n't that bad ... until you noticed the small things .
wallpaper peeling ... dirty showers ... etc .
i 'm so annoyed though i am never staying here again !
after taking no more than _num_ minutes of the stone bench , we left .
early check-in is $ _num_ plus tax extra .
this is not a suite but a single large square room .
what you get here is a motel _num_ with a casino under it .
i see there are _num_ stars on the main page here for the rio ?
still at 2:30 pm no room service .
what happens in vegas is all hype !
it 's cheap .
the place is run down : the shower is moldy .
there are many light bulbs burned out all over the place .
they charge you to check in before _num_ pm .
you wo n't find it on the map .
there are some treadmills and weights .
the problem with this hotel is the staff and the horrible customer service .
i hung up and called back two more times still no one ever answered .
so much for getting the room for _num_ bucks a night .
turns out the rooftop nightclub is only _num_ floors above us .
we could clearly hear partying going on as well .
_num_ am comes ... .
the club does not close .
one of the pools even features and artificial beach which was nice .
a little steep i think for the quality of hotel the rio is .
our stay included _num_ complimentary breakfast buffets .
watch the slot machine aisles , that 's where it 's worst .
the valet is short on employees , it took forever to escape .
note : none of the ice machines were working during our stay .
she said sure , $ _num_ a bucket .
you have ice machines , and blatantly know that none of them work .
ridiculous .
especially for someone calling from a suite .
this is unacceptable .
the people staying here were extremely ghetto as well .
i will never book another room at the rio again .
as others have said , wish there was no star .
now its a has been washed up waiting to be sold dirty dive .
first the rooms are just worn out and dirty .
from my bed i could see two french fries under the sofa .
the ceiling the the shower is peeling .
there were many stains in the carpet i never took off my flip flops .
it got so bad other single women in my area noticed it too .
horrible or shall i say non existent service pool side .
customer service is not important here at all .
i would not stay here again .
extra charge for it and often gave us problems .
the toilets flush so loud ... too loud !
we payed all that money to stay there no deals no discounts so disappointed !
$ _num_ a day for internet service in the room is an insult .
$ _num_ for a soda from the vending machine is an insult .
unfortunately our safe was not working .
the place is not well kept at all .
all in all , it was like a cheap motel _num_ .
i was is room _num_ .
i would probably not book with rio ever again .
this place gets _num_ stars instead of _num_ star because of the price .
the decor needs a facelift .
front desk reps were rude and did n't really seem to want to help .
employees were great , management sucked at buffet though .
the prime rib was undercooked to the point of being unappetizing at the buffet .
but the kicker was the buffet management .
unnecessary trip to go there anyway .
can lose just as bad at other more friendly casinos .
my wife and i went to rio for a short vacation .
this hotel is run down and not what it used to be .
first rio does not have the show above the ceiling .
customer service is not good either .
room _num_ did not have soap etc .
the hotel is outdated and needs new carpets .
hotel is outdated but is in ok condition .
resort fees are hidden .
not friendly front desk .
no way !
i never want to stay in this bed bug infested crap hole again .
line to check in took over _num_ hours .
awful , just awful .
they do not charge your actual receipt amount .
dirty , tired the place is past its prime .
even for free i would never step foot inside again .
dump is the _num_ letter word that best describes this place .
needless to say we are not coming back .
horrible experience staying here .
staff was rude .
rooms are outdated dirty and not like the pics .
they 're called suites but are not very suite like .
all in all terrible experience .
worst service in vegas .
room was old an dated .
had to wheel her to airplane she could n't walk .
and most confusing only pepsi ?
my husband and i have been regulars at the rio for many years .
i did that twice but to date have not received a response .
am i seeing the death of a big resort first hand ?
is this the sad ending to a once extremely popular hotel ?
no soft serve at the buffet !
i was totally disgusted .
but i probably wouldnt stay here again .
the room was also far from the parking which i hate .
this place is big too , easy to get lost .
other than that , they 'll never get my money ever again .
customer service is terrible !
sure they provide shuttles , but it 's not always convenient , trust me !
sometimes you want to just jump on the cab and get to your destination .
my boyfriend and i got sick friday night and assumed it was food poisoning .
it absolutely ruined our trip .
so , we were n't really able to leave the hotel .
it would have been the classy thing to do .
he needs more training on handling customer service .
no smiles on his face and no suggestions on how things can be better .
worst experience service i ever had .
my company booked the room for me .
i did not arrive to check into my room until around 11pm .
the staff was quite rude !
when i got to my room the second diet coke was gone .
like a stale old dirty bar .
its gross .
realized there was no coffee nor coffee condiments on the counter .
are you kidding me ?
they had no right in my room when i asked for privacy .
just finished up a stay at the rio .
front desk service was terrible .
they offered us an upgrade to a better room .
i would have hated to see our original room .
i would not recommend this hotel .
rio does n't deliver , as with most off strip casino .
views of the rooms are boring .
i guess updating with newer slots is not a consideration here .
horrible hotel , shitty casino , really bad customer service .
never again will i stay at this casino .
rio 's management is horrible .
the worst part is the manager does n't think it 's a big deal .
all our clothes smell like fried foods .
i will never book a room at this dump again .
was taken out of hotel suite by security , in a wheelchair .
a senior security officer told me the hotel is not safe .
he was n't anywhere near the casino floor .
just into the snack shop at the bottom of the hotel tower elevator .
clearly it 's not a good place for families .
too bad , i guess that 's why it 's so cheap .
and the in room coffee is $ _num_ .
god i ca n't wait to leave !
only stayed here bc of my convention was here .
would not stay again .
very uncomfortable especially for the price we paid .
unpleasant experience , to say the least .
no entertainment just awful place to be .
this place is kinda gross .
walls are paper thin so you hear everything .
but due to the noise factor i would not recommend staying here .
right from the start we were disappointed .
so checking in was a slight nightmare .
our room was very dated .
no complimentary coffee in room ( bring your own k cups ) .
does n't sound like much winning here .
the shower pressure was horrible !
like another reviewer mentioned , the wifi here was also horrible !
why charge for it , if you ca n't even access it ?
this was a non smoking room .
worn out .
horrible lighting .
none of the water hitting you as you stand underneath the shower head .
awful ... .
_num_ a person .
my filet was insane !
i do n't mind paying more for a meal .
zero to eat if you are vegetarian .
casino looks really run down ... stay on the strip .
lots of old timers and people that look like they have a gambling problem .
the place little outdated .
they have penn & teller as a permanent show .
i went to the rio to see penn and teller , who were fantastic .
my room had not been properly cleaned .
a/c worked sometimes and sometimes it blew hot air .
then when the show was almost over we were smoking by the restroom .
just to be sure it was head security guard johnny .
very rude and does n't deserve his job .
terrible terrible old ran down hotel !
we rented four ( _num_ ) rooms !
but only for _num_ device .
i felt ripped off and will never stay at the rio again !
i brought my family here to spend a couple nights to get away .
very disappointed children .
just an open creepy hole in the wall with a piece of glass .
only _num_ stars i did not feel the food was up to par .
no complaints but definitely not memorable .
i will come back for the event hopefully it would be better food experience .
copy and paste my sample letter below and complain .
the clerk at the rio told me it was a `` resort fee '' .
my printed receipt said `` paid in full '' .
i did not agree to pay additional fees upon check out .
i feel this is unfair business practice and needs to be addressed and stopped .
almost every person at the check out desk was complaining about the same thing .
the resort fee did not even include internet or coffee .
business count on people being too busy to do anything about it .
i was very disappointed in my last visit to the rio .
_num_ passes to the gym and free wi-fi for _num_ device ?
unfortunately we could n't opt out .
we were charge $ _num_ for each of these items .
the safe in our room did n't work .
we waited _num_ before calling them back and saying never mind .
we will not be coming back .
such a shame .
first bad thing is the location .
some guy did n't like us moving poolside chairs into a shade .
no one ever showed up to fix it .
the coffee should be free , but it 's not .
rather , it 's expensive !
worst hotel i ever stayed at in lv .
less than half the computer stations had a staff person .
had to pay for wifi ( even motel _num_ offers free wifi ) .
food overly priced and not that good .
slots were extremely tight .
overall it was ok but really dislike no free coffee in the rooms .
little thing but with so many choices i will never stay here again .
problem one , the batter of the door key pad died .
the `` lock smith '' showed up _num_ minutes later .
she said she `` can not promise '' that being done .
oh and $ _num_ per person for a cabana is insane .
disgusting .
this hotel is sorry excuse for a good clean time in vegas .
i am really disappointed .
the maid service was also poor .
i could n't believe it !
do n't expect a nice hotel .
its more like a motel with poor customer service .
i stayed _num_ days for a conference .
the hotel itself is old-school and is in need of an upgrade .
the other restaurants in the hotel were just okay .
so we did and when we came back it still smelled like smoked .
this is a bad experience .
that part was my mistake to trust rio .
i called housekeeping and they said we have to pay for it .
the employees rather visit with each other than take care of the guest .
very disappointed .
wo n't stay here again .
front desk service slow .
no coffee in room .
waited _num_ minutes for valet , so we self parked .
food looked nasty and the place is filthy .
the whole property needs a good pressure wash inside and out .
no longer a hot spot free pool for local son the weekend .
$ _num_ per adult and $ _num_ for children .
no wonder it 's completely dead for a saturday !
boring .
this was the 1st time we actually stated at the rio .
no fun waiting in _num_ temperature for a shuttle .
too much of a hassle .
the place needs so much work .
we booked _num_ rooms and all were crappy .
the billing receipts is atrocious !
stop trying to settle charges that are more than the actual charge .
pool has mold by the water fall .
all-around bad experience .
the individual working was very rude and not willing to help .
i do n't understand why it was not delivered promptly to my room .
i emailed caesars and again they did nothing for me .
i do not remember rio being this horrible .
rude staff and not willing to accommodate guests .
very unorganized and they make everything seem like it 's your fault .
it is a saturday and the casino is almost empty .
just disgusting .
do n't stay here if you want a clean room or good customer service .
feels more like a cheap motel .
this hotel is very dated and dirty .
then he said , `` are n't you going to put it in ? ''
then i explained to him that it was not a bulb .
maybe i should check out the pool before making the final decision .
valet parking is a joke , took over _num_ min a few times .
stores within the casino are very expensive .
it is so far off the strip it is very inconvenient .
worst stay ever !
if i can give negative star i will give them _num_ stars !
and they should be more professional and should already know about this !
i 'm not come back to rio ever again !
it takes _num_ minutes or more just to check in to this place .
when i got to the room i quickly realized how filthy it was .
the buffet was a little small for my taste but that 's alright .
very odd for a vegas pool .
here 's why it only got two stars .
they made no mention of this at check-in .
$ _num_ bottle of water and and $ _num_ wifi charges .
the last time i stayed here , the rooms were real suites .
never go to the rio buffet .
disappointed , and _num_ dollars short .
we just stayed here and not to happy with this hotel .
customer service workers do not care about their guest .
manager was very rude & did n't care & i told him .
i got my card no problem .
i said yes i smell it too but that is not my husband .
just married ready to start a family .
what an awful experience and way to start my _num_ night stay .
this pool was absolutely disgusting .
i have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel .
they charged me for _num_ reservations .
i was unable to check in until i finally spoke to a manager .
highly disappointed .
first thing was you have to pay $ _num_ per day for wifi .
put a/c down to very cold .
never got below _num_ .
i 've been in way better rooms for the money .
not a place i 'd go out if my way to stay at again .
needs a serious cleaning , we stayed there because of the convention .
in the restaurant , you can not substitute at all .
sprinkles ate much better then this shower .
this was the worst place to stay even for the price .
do n't recommend unless it 's very convenient .
not impressed .
with all the casino options in vegas , go elsewhere .
we stayed at the rio because that was where the convention was .
the room does not have a microwave .
luckily the maintenance man arrived within minutes and took only seconds to fix .
also no outside food delivery are allowed inside the hotel .
so be prepared to walk to the front entrance to pick it up .
there 's nothing you can do ?
not the `` fabulous '' room i was promised .
`` high speed wifi '' is not what they offer .
i 'm never staying there again .
do n't waste your money , get the regular suite .
overall it was an ok stay and i would stay again .
it smelled like a mixture of stale smoke and sewer .
so we could n't go anywhere and that was our only free night .
then the room itself was pretty beat up that they seem to find acceptable .
while the ac worked well , it was extremely loud and noisy .
looked awful .
expect long lines at check in and long waits at the elevator .
having just stayed _num_ nights at the rio i am so disappointed .
they did however take off $ _num_ for our trouble .
we stayed at two hotels , this being the second one .
i do not recommend this hotel .
old and run down .
also some nice red duck tape to hold the carpet down in this room .
do not stay at rio !
i called the front desk & they sent the security up to our room .
i also stayed at golden nugget and had no problem paying their resort fee .
the room i got at rio was ok .
it is dirty & not maintained properly ... ... .
i shook all my luggage before i went home i 'd .
rather pay more if i am on vacation ... .
wow almost made me cry for being a good customer .
when my husband and both tries to explain , this tone got nasty !
i was so embarrassed !
it 's disgusting that they all but called me a liar .
shame on you guys .
the hot water in the shower took _num_ mins .
it was so bad .
were they treated so poorly because they were young adults ?
our room was clean but fixtures are clearly outdated .
we were here during one of vegas ' biggest weekends of the year .
disgusting and so unsanitary !
i 've stayed here over ten to fifteen times over the past _num_ years .
is it not enough that we get charged for it in the resort fee ?
no thanks .
large room , ok bed , worn out sofa .
rooms are nice .
also checked in at _num_ am .
but gave away room after room ... did n't get us in till 8pm .
which is no big deal .
he has no personality and no word of honor .
they even called a security for us to leave the place .
the room was horrible .
total nightmare .
it was _num_ degrees in vegas and the heater was broken in my room .
she told me i would just have to sleep in the cold .
$ _num_ ?
i will not stay at the rio again and do not recommend it .
stay at mgm , palms , or mandalay bay for the same price .
$ _num_ to check in `` early '' meaning _num_ pm ?
the room itself is a total disgrace !
would not recommend !
we thought ... ok this ca n't be that bad and took it .
you could tell she did n't like those things either .
so this was a fail fail fail and then fail again .
i ca n't see myself going back anytime soon .
the $ _num_ ( ? )
`` resort fee '' added insult to injury .
no bueno .
they offered a _num_ bedroom suite and a studio suite .
not much complain about it .
no one know anything .
stains on couch very gross .
money saved by not staying on strip is not worth it .
i would give a zero because customer service is horrible .
no loss on their part in anyway .
wrong !
first off the rooms need some major updating and better maintenance .
another thing that needs major updating is the plumbing !
this hotel is cheap but it 's for the reason .
they treated us really bad and we had to leave .
we stayed in the older part of the hotel and the rooms were terrible .
not only that but we barely had hot water .
they only offer _num_ bars of soap .
shampoo and conditioner was all in one .
so disappointed .
made a reservation at the beginning of this month for a room in august .
this is the same thing they told _num_ % of my coworkers .
the room in the movie hangover would n't even take that long to clean .
they upgraded my room for a small fee , toilet does n't even work .
went out drinking and gambling got back at _num_ am to my room .
card does n't work to open the door .
same goes for mgm or mandalay bay hotels !
very rude and arrogant staff throughout this hotel .
the staff appear to have no interest .
i have no problem dropping the $ $ $ .
first , the room are kinda run down .
peeling wallpaper , chipped paint , etc .
i was stuck at the higher room rates .
they made no mention of this until checkout .
i have stayed all over the world and have never seen this setup .
the carnival buffet and our lunches during the week were very unimpressive .
our room was rundown and had old food in the refrigerator .
there was a bag of garbage outside our door .
so sad how this place has become a has been .
beds were mushy .
they moved me finally but that was a huge ordeal .
the shower water is not hot and no separate shampoo and conditioner .
i would not recommend this place even for free .
just stayed here for _num_ days for a music teacher conference .
the rooms were quite nice , spacious but ridiculously expensive wifi .
i hate it .
so far my stay has been horrible .
there is a lack of communication between the staff and guests .
unless you like being disappointed in which case the rio is for you .
the rio sucks .
lots of add on costs and ridiculously expensive food and drinks .
hotel _num_ does n't even charge for that .
spend the extra money upfront for another resort .
seriously if you want to have a good time do not stay here !
it 's the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
the staff is very rude , it takes forever to check in and out .
it 's unbelievable how this happened !
so far the casino has not paid out well at all .
not the attention to detail i was looking for !
the older rooms are really falling apart .
you can still smell the smoke through the ac !
check out was the worst ever !
the first room had torn carpet and the mini bar did n't work .
i do n't mind paying , but make it worth my while .
even the starbucks is over priced .
the only good thing was the maid that cleaned our room .
so i left her a nice big tip after the cleanings .
( for _num_ days previous we stayed at the grand view resorts ) .
so essentially you can get a room for around _num_ .
it 's not on the strip , it 's across the highway .
and the bath room shows mold .
bad hotel .
i should have never considered such a trashy hotel in the first place .
top it off , ac did n't work .
worst stayed ever .
food at the buffet were horrible .
husband got food poisoning same night .
never staying at rio 's again .
the wifi is not consistently works in the room .
moreover , the phone lines do not work .
she told me to call _num_ _num_ minutes later .
i could n't find coffee in the room .
tea is only available through the room services ( more tips and fees ) .
horrible service .
no class at all .
old tower rooms are old .
bathrooms horrible .
always on hold _num_ or _num_ mins .
the wifi is not consistently works in the room .
moreover , the phone lines do not work .
she told me to call _num_ _num_ minutes later .
i could n't find coffee in the room .
tea is only available through the room services ( more tips and fees ) .
worst experience ever .
i responded , `` no '' .
i wish i did n't even have to give them the star !
extremely disappointed !
the rio has definitely fallen from the `` greatness '' of the late 90s .
this place will never see me again .
added fees upon check-in .
the couch was horrible , you sink in so far its ' stupid .
they sat us in the bar with loud tvs and yelling people .
tried the buffet , which was adequate but nothing special .
only one roulette table in operation in the casino .
outdated rooms , and did n't want to inspect the cleanliness too closely .
this is my worst review ever , so i 'll stop now .
we were n't too impressed with the rio .
the room itself was dated but clean .
room was n't serviced over a two day period .
trying to find the right elevator for the rooms can be confusing .
well first thing they never explained how much there resort fee was .
the young lady was very helpful to my girlfriend about giving her directions .
he must have been embarrassed at how much they charge .
well the place that sells breakfast does n't open until 8am .
so no coffee shop open until 8am .
it 's $ _num_ in cab fare each way with a tip .
it would n't check me out .
it 's not a value .
resort fees to high , customer service weak at best .
no free coffee in the room .
no early morning coffee shop except starbucks .
i will never return and glad to tell friends not to either .
the pool seemed nice enough but the clientele are sad and depressing .
worst service i have ever experienced in vegas .
they charge $ _num_ for ( _num_ ) k cups of coffee , really !
one guest was just charged $ _num_ , another $ _num_ .
this place has a bull shit staff that refuses to assist anyone on anything .
next time i 'll just stick with my white castle box room idea .
nothing .
nothing could have been farther from the truth .
do n't stay at the rio if you enjoy warm showers .
( _num_ ) .
we got an error message that said to try back in _num_ mins .
my husband and i stayed here over memorial weekend .
it was only 11:30 and there was hardly anyone there yet .
she completely went out of her way to ignore us .
in the future , we will not be going to this pool .
the second room was clean but smelled like a wood burning fireplace .
waited in line for an hour to get our room ( no exaggeration ) .
and , this was at 10:30 pm .
did n't get to sleep til midnight .
idiots .
this was the worst one .
some facilities such as lamp were not working at all .
i did n't feel she was ready to help customers .
i am really disappointed !
i am just super thankful that i did not let my child walk !
would give this place negative stars if i could .
meaning they opened the safe for a random person without checking id .
i point blank told them i was not going to spend another dime there .
sure enough sunday is apparently not considered a weekend to these people .
somehow things still get worse .
the only reason they are getting two stars was because i ordered a pizza .
it was just thrown together anyway and looked horrible .
worst room service in las vegas .
everything is served in paper bowls .
they even give you plastic silverware with your very overpriced food .
servings are small and it 's just bad bad bad .
what a disappointment .
as if this was something i didnt already know .
horrible .
sitting here with no wifi .
i get passed around and no one can help .
all this money for a room with no internet access at all .
hell , at least motel _num_ could of given me wifi .
power went out twice ( probably due to the heat wave ) .
obviously not there fault ... but it was handled poorly .
terrible customer service .
i have to say .
first time here at the rio hotel and i 'm dissapointed .
waited about _num_ hours and called _num_ times and no one showed up .
lastly , we called for a bell boy to assist us with our luggage .
communication was not there .
this place is gross .
it 's too bad .
but no more .
really , rio ?
rooms are old and outdated , definitely not kid friendly .
air conditioning is horrible , furnishings are from the _num_ 's .
what a huge disappointment !
but you get what you pay for , my stay overall was pretty cheap .
_num_ night stay in a suite for under $ _num_ .
and another issue is that they need elevators near the end of the hotels !
the alcohol in the gift shop is ridiculous !
will not stay there again .
the staff at the snack bar chatted , and took no food orders .
but we were so disappointed that i felt we should share our experience .
this is the most awful experience in las vegas i ever had .
it 's hard to decide if i like this place or not .
so a deal to spend some time away was nice .
the lady i spoke with was less than helpful and did n't explain much .
never had to wait so long for a hotel valet line .
finally got to drop off the car and asked for assistance with luggage .
again , another long wait now in _num_ degree heat .
horrible first night experience so far .
let 's just say there are many many many other much better options .
booked two non smoking rooms and was told both rooms we got are non-smoking .
really , rio ?
this place made me sad .
bellagio : fixed immediately .
the rio : meh , whatever .
the rio : whatever .
smells gross in our supposed non smoking room .
only one elevator is working .
had to wait _num_ minutes to go downstairs .
would not stay here again .
very poor customer service .
the rooms are nice and big , but the place is lacking in service .
just seems kinda cheap .
disgusting .
i 've stayed in motel _num_ 's nicer than this .
this is a pretty terrible hotel/casino .
the hotel feels like it 's falling apart .
stay away from the sunday brunch buffet .
not sure why .
you can not even see the picture taken .
the food was very poor quality .
and they did n't have it very organized .
eggs were runny ( literally like water ) and the spaghetti was cold .
everything else ... horrible .
do n't believe their advertised low rates of $ _num_ per night .
this is so wrong and should be against the law .
we checked in on august _num_ _num_ , that was the first mistake .
bathroom counter , broken and dirty .
unacceptable !
several guest speakers left early as well , they were sick too .
rio , you turned my vacation into a hell thank you very much !
this was not a holiday inn .
even if it was , it 's still highly unacceptable .
i 've been waiting for my room for hours !
they jus not seem to care .
poorly thought out design .
sadly the rio is no longer on my list of acceptable options .
beg bugs .
i felt so disgusting .
i would have rated it better but those bed bug bites ruined everything .
and , i let it run for _num_ solid minutes on both mornings !
although there were plenty of open tables , no one was being seated .
being off the strip , there really are n't any dining alternatives nearby .
the shower door is so hard to open .
i wish they had offered the other tower at the time of check-in .
from the looks of yelp , the other tower seems to be newer .
disgusting !
the time share people at the entrance to our towers elevators are extremely obnoxious .
put your money towards a much better hotel .
there were small pieces of potato chips on the floor .
i 've stayed at this hotel three times over the last couple of years .
( by the way , calling this place `` all suites '' is misleading .
check-in is a nightmare .
you can get much better food elsewhere for a lot less money .
checkout is nearly as bad as check-in .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
there was a large pecan left inside my hotel room upon checking in .
had an allergic reaction and could n't get a refund for the issue .
could not do tv in room or online check out .
will not be staying here again .
so i booked the room .
not even a credit for my next trip ?
will not return to rio .
so disappointing .
this place is terrible and unsafe .
rio took a report but did n't even offer to change their room .
here 's the good and bad of this place .
does n't work .
front desk staff is slow .
the rio was low cost so i made a reservation .
the lines to check in were outrageous .
luckily i had pre checked in online so my wait was reasonable .
my hotel clerk was brand new , very slow and nervous .
my room smelled of cigarette though i requested non smoking .
there was no room service menu and the tv would n't work .
you have been warned .
they failed to tell us it was a handicap shower .
not great for a _num_ foot tall guy !
also , the shower hose was leaking .
btw rio , thanks for the nasty view of your ugly rooftop .
not impressed for a first timer .
this place is a dump and the staff is really rude .
the staff was not friendly at check in and were very slow .
whenever i called for housekeeping i was brushed off .
oh , and the casino floor smelled really bad of sewer !
i refused to spend anymore money there and did n't dare eat !
this place leaves much to be desired .
my bed was comfy , i will admit .
however , my couch had stains all over it .
never sat on that bad boy .
ick .
the dealers had zero personality .
that 's not how we wanted to start our evening .
not this one : - ( i wo n't be back !
he said floors _num_ and up were remodeled .
doubt i 'll stay again until they remodel .
i would never stay here again .
they tried to sign me up for a visa card .
breakfast buffet was a nice _num_ $ for _num_ not including tip .
this place is heading downhill fast and needs to just go away .
it really was this bad and this is my first bad hotel review !
shower heads are disgusting .
check in staff and supervisor staff needs to be trained on empathy .
soon is not an answer when you 've go to be at a meeting .
the water pressure just absolutely sucked .
no one at the front desk when i called seemed to be too bothered .
the television would cut off at will or go to snow .
bent , cracked and in a couple of places just missing .
but a word of warning , dont use the valet service .
thats not the worst .
the first thing i noticed when we walked in was the smell .
it was like an old folks home .
to some degree , i do n't blame the rio .
do not stay in the classic rooms .
what a hot mess !
they are only worth about $ _num_ a night .
worst hotel in vegas .
went to security and they did nothing .
this place is better off without a security department .
called guest services and nothing was done about that either .
not a safe hotel , no regard for their clients .
plenty of options in vegas do n't pick this one .
although the room was clean the bed was lumpy .
casino was clean and people were nice .
i 'll stay elsewhere next time .
horrible stay .
no running water at 3am .
finally water came on at 5am , but no hot water .
ridiculous .
was told to try running it for _num_ mins and hot will come back .
but even agent said it would n't make a difference .
tried the _num_ min suggestion and it did n't work .
i shrugged it off and went down to the casino .
find a better casino hotel to stay at .
failure at customer service .
staff needs a lot of training in how to work with people .
shrugged it off .
this trip , i am very disappointed with the room .
the shower area is leaking water and it 's just disgusting .
but why pay good money and resort fees for a motel quality room ?
do not stay here !
they locked the stairs so you ca n't use them .
this seems like it would be a fire hazard .
they refused to do anything to make up for their booking mistakes .
our next stay will not be at this filthy hotel .
do n't fall for it .
such a disappointment .
the room is not a suite !
like i said , these rooms at the rio are not suites !
so , i 've stayed here twice and that will be it .
only good thing ... the bed was comfortable .
gave it a week before i write this so i could cool off .
asked for extra towels every night and never got them .
the package was supposed to be a better deal , but wasnt .
it would have been cheaper had i made the reservation elsewhere .
that 's why this is ridiculous , i bought it straight from an associate .
do n't you want to raise your stars , better your image and brand ?
the customer service crap .
whatever you do do not stay here .
spent _num_ nights at the rio this past weekend .
night _num_ : no hot water .
day _num_ : `` hot '' water was lukewarm .
i realize it was built in _num_ but it 's old and tired .
casino is the money maker so in decent shape .
no food or show or lunch promise was kept .
not even close .
shame on me .
sorry , rio , it 's up to you to not have them there .
the registration clerk , lauren , was not helpful nor trained in customer service .
purchased the room on groupon that included $ _num_ food credit .
the food credit also requires you to sign up for their rewards club .
worst experience ever !
will not stay here again .
do not fall for it like i did !
worst stay ever .
rio staff , i would like to be refunded for my stay .
your place was a mess and nearly ruined my first vegas experience .
no breakfast buffet as the buffet opens at 11am and considered as lunch .
usually , there are basic amenities for new years that were not present .
terrible experience compared to previous years !
give this place _num_ star .
it smells , the room have no water or anything in it .
not going to use you guys again .
pay $ _num_ for a night .
i would give them _num_ if it 's possible !
upon entering the room , a very awful smell hit us .
the room did n't even look like the pictures on their website .
if we want a room like that , it would be $ _num_ more .
it smelled even worse !
this place is terrible .
horrible .
so we booked for the night due to plumbing issues at our home .
not to mention their slot selection in the casino sucks .
i was very displeased with the stay .
the walls are paper thin .
can i put zero stars ?
worst experience ever .
very dissatisfied and disappointed .
but everything after that went downhill from there .
i was in a non smoking room , that smelled like smoke .
my room fridge was dirty .
i stopped my the vending machine for water and it took my money .
the toilets , the sinks , the showers !
no water !
i told them this was unacceptable and wanted to talk to a manager .
ok ... no $ _num_ for a $ _num_ bottle for me .
she was embarrassed , said their policy changed in the summer .
no one that works here is the least bit friendly .
my company is mostly caters to older people .
no towels wtf ?
the hotel itself has a big casino in the bottom of it .
i am not a fan .
my husband , myself and some friends recently stayed here for the weekend .
upon arrival we were very excited for a weekend away .
being tired we got into out rooms and headed to bed .
you 've been warned from our experience .
i only gave _num_ stars because the pool is nice .
the furniture was broken it was just horrible .
worst hotel experience in my entire life .
other than that , it was horrible .
she never came back with soap or towels .
_num_ ) the guests and atmosphere are both disgusting .
the low rates speak for themselves .
everyone was loud , obnoxious and trashy .
the bathrooms look dated and are gross .
old , ugly , dusty and not convenient .
i was not really happy about that .
i would n't stay here again.
however the price could n't be beat .
to their credit , they changed my rate after i called .
the lines outside the hotel owned starbucks are ridiculous .
it was worse in some rooms than others .
woman was rude .
then wait for security and return to line for a new key .
catering charges expensive .
there were some very friendly staff and others not so much .
i wo n't be back .
but the furniture are very old .
the buffet is too expensive for the low quality food .
overall , not satisfied , wifi not stay here in the future .
stay away from this place like the plague .
i took my girlfriend to vegas for her birthday in early may _num_ .
the food was overpriced and of very low quality .
this was n't the bust of our trip , though .
no apology .
i wish i had remembered to review the rio much earlier .
i would hate for anyone to have to experience the service that we received .
this is my worst hotel experience ever !
i had to stay here for a conference so i was stuck .
the rooms were dingy and lacked basics like a coffee maker .
one phone in the room did n't work .
we stayed at the fourth floor , the room was falling apart .
the hallway was falling apart .
this place is garbage , i wo n't be staying their again .
been in vegas for _num_ days !
rio is by far the worst !
worst location !
worst food !
worst restaurant options !
the absolute worst !
i booked for _num_ adults and _num_ child .
the only room that was still available was a smoking room .
it was the most disgusting , filthy room i have ever seen .
it smelled so bad .
they said they were completely booked and there was nothing they could do .
one of the worst nights ever .
customer service is ridiculously slow and incompetent .
and this visit was a miss .
then came the room .
ugh .
does maintenance not check anything ?
the door pin in the bathroom was about to fall out .
the trash bags were missing .
lamp on the table , broken .
customer service is terrible !
do n't spend your vacation here .
disgusting !
worst hotel ever !
sorry rio but you guys need some major updates .
the carpet was stained all over .
one thing i ca n't complain was the bed it was comfortable .
and unless i am mistaken , the rooms do n't seem as big .
it was a horrible week here at this hotel/casino .
locked exit doors on the first floor ?
when brought to their attention , they said there 's nothing they could do .
other people are showing their ass but security is not saying anything about that .
seriously , save your money and do n't go here .
stay very far away !
disaster !
to begin my room was not properly stocked with soap and lotion upon arrival .
each employee with the exception of two displayed nasty attitudes .
i could n't heat water to make a late-night ramen snack .
this topped off our stay .
after taxes and everything , i ended up paying $ _num_ .
terribly terrible and misleading .
sad because the night before $ _num_ was asked for .
sad , no coffee pots in rooms either .
i have stayed many times at the rio but wo n't anymore .
i checked out immediately .
the concierge let us know that it was not valid .
no offer to honor the valid booking at all .
it looked like the room had n't been updated since the late _num_ 's .
i deserve a clean shower .
the beds sleep as if the bought them used from the motel _num_ .
so rude !
terrible customer service .
aside from that not worth it at all .
this hotel used to be great .
first off , i paid _num_ per night , a sunday and a monday .
wrong !
so much for _num_ a night .
not anymore .
after _num_ pm so do n't even think about it .
vegas in general is just a big lit up trap .
the rio just does n't have it anymore .
tv with cable in room .
poor building maintenance .
not in central location .
uncomfortable beds and pillows .
my roommate and i stayed here for a convention in april _num_ .
i mean , come on .
the beds are very uncomfortable and the pillows are like sacks of cotton balls .
the room smells musty so i am not surprised .
that means a lot of very long lines and cranky staff members .
not to mention grossly overpriced food .
they did n't we had to call the desk after two hours passed .
it looked like it was a room fit for _num_ instead of _num_ .
the old dirty green carpet and old curtains and lamps were horrible .
there was no microwave only a small refrigerator .
we did n't want to sleep in that old bed .
if you want to gamble there is no shortage of slot machines .
service was kind of rude on the phone .
this hotel is not just a little bad it 's horrific .
i stayed here only due to a convention i was attending .
there was an elevator that kept dropping and engaging and he emergency brakes .
to close do n't book here if you have a choice .
i checked in and could not hear anything the staff was saying .
the rooms are dated and the furniture is in poor condition .
they said they cant remove furniture from the meeting rooms .
the entire hotel has no office chair .
i guess this will be my first and last visit to rio !
do n't stay here .
the restaurants are expensive here and long lines .
you need a gas mask just to walk through the casino !
so much cigarette smoke !
worst experience of my life .
i never write reviews ; however , this requires one .
the prices are ridiculous and some of the staff is quite rude .
this alarm lasts from 12:30 am to _num_ am on a monday night .
all of this , with my own money .
avoid rio at all costs .
room quality i find to be similar .
wo n't come back again .
well sorry , mom but this needs to be said .
worst hotel in the caesars group !
the rooms : when 's the last time these rooms have been cleaned ?
but do n't get your hopes up .
very poor excuses for a so called upscale room .
you want a suite go to a more upscale place .
we ate at the hash house , not good .
i would not stay there again .
and yes resort fee $ _num_ a day .
plain rip-off .
do not stay here .
the only redeeming quality was that the room was clean and a good size .
but overall not worth it .
i wo n't be staying here in the future .
it 's honestly not worth the money .
hotel has no concerns to their clients ... .
very long walk to the meeting rooms making it not handicap friendly .
no coffee , not enough food , etc .
there are people sitting on the floor because there 's not enough seats .
stained furniture , filthy sheets and _num_ broken lamps in our room .
staff is friendly but this property is long overdue for a remodel .
too many better choices in this town to stay here .
the hot water lasted about _num_ minutes .
i 've stayed at all least _num_ properties on or near the strip .
never have i encountered this type of lack of service .
what type of hotel runs out of basic amenities .
it was not even close .
everything was worn out and old .
gold coast resort fee = $ _num_ per night , no transaction fee .
it 's disgusting - old room from the _num_ 's .
a lot of retail space empty and boarded up .
bartenders are rude and talk about their union a lot .
just try to open a bar tab and charge it to your room .
there is no _num_ hour dining in this place .
not good either .
too many other choices in vegas .
_num_ for a resort fee for a pool open from _num_ to _num_ pm .
is for ?
forget a charger and ordered it from amazon .
they want to charge you _num_ dollars to get your package .
front desk did not care at all about complaints .
casino is descent .
these beds for me did not work .
the casino floor was never over crowded , which i liked .
they were clean just not comfortable for me .
not sure why it is called a suite but it was nice .
do n't advertise something if your not going to do it !
the worst part of the resort for me was the front desk .
they made me walk to their computer lab and pay to print one .
did i pay resort fees ?
that does n't include the price of printing a boarding pass ?
ugh .
so , every morning ten thousand guests wake up to no coffee .
i did not stay here , just came for the casino .
i do n't see anything exceptional about this place .
it 's _num_ degrees and i 've asked two different employees .
called to let them know of the problem .
room _num_ star clean ok .
problem # _num_ resort fee $ _num_ a night for what ?
i never experienced bed bugs before and i hope i never do .
not good .
the food is n't good .
the place is depressing .
only one bank of elevators stops at 9th floor .
will try calling her at number they gave me .
maybe if she gets enough calls , they 'll consider fixing the elevators .
nothing bad .
the room , mediocre .
the staff , mediocre .
the decor , we 'll you get the idea .
room service by the way comes in plastic bags with plastic utensils .
the food is - you guessed it , mediocre .
this hotel has the worst service .
however , be aware that the rooms can be rather worn .
did n't know a guest would have to do that .
my first call to customer service was rude !
blew it off like it was nothing .
i will no longer stay at the rio .
_num_ pools and a slow floating river .
ive eaten here once .
okay , it could have been better .
food : the food was tasty , but unfortunately i 've had better .
unfortunately , i probably would n't go here again .
i 'm sure there is better out there .
a very expensive place for a americanized indian food .
food was definitely bland .
ok so this review is long overdue .
very expensive .
since this in located inside the rio , its prices are through the roof !
service was slow and apathetic it really did remind me of india .
the lamb vindaloo was not good at all .
chicken very dry .
had a groupon so did n't pay full price .
worst decision ever .
i just get much better deals at other shops in town .
it is normally $ _num_ .
the second time i decided they just are n't that friendly .
there is a reason that they have such a bad yelp score .
worst customer service !
no rear drain plug .
this would have been nice to know before i ordered through them .
go fuck yourself bro , you 're a grown ass man selling dirt bikes .
he messed up my paperwork _num_ times .
well i am not now because obviously this place just wants your money .
i have been here several times and the service is pretty poor .
one of the most condescending experiences i 've ever had .
i will say is not my favorite shop to spend the night in vegas .
because under no circumstances will they accept returns !
even though i bought a $ _num_ item , they would not return it .
and we very rude about it .
so horrible i ca n't even tell you !
they posted signs stating their ac was broken at the moment .
it should be called golden palm dump !
just trust me on this one , it 's bad .
save yourself some trouble and do not stay here .
this place does n't even deserve a star .
this is the worst place i have ever stayed .
if you expect to vacation here you could do better elsewhere .
the hotel itself is n't anything to write to elvis about .
avoid at all cost .
what a mistake .
this was my experience .
it was $ _num_ .
first i received some starter soup that was was overly salty and plain .
then i made the mistake of eating the main course .
the first taste was n't any better .
it was n't like any chile verde or green chile i 've ever had .
i 'd rate it a zero if i could .
drove into an empty parking lot .
that was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway .
overall not impressed .
i love smith 's ... just not this location .
reason _num_ : i purchased spoiled meat from here .
gross .
i waited _num_ minutes , spoke to _num_ different employees and nobody did anything .
you 're busy and lazy and understaffed .
reason _num_ : this is in an older shopping plaza .
smiths is awesome but this was is disgusting !
what a mistake .
second , the store is simply not clean .
the shelves are a mess too .
the parking lot is a mess too .
trash blowing around .
in search of cake pops .
not here .
why smith 's allows this is beyond me .
too bad those people are now gone .
no excuse .
their reply _num_ of the _num_ times ?
`` the prices listed were wrong '' .
not the nicest of smith 's grocery stores .
i might have actually freaked out and i 'm sure people saw me .
it was just gross .
the staff is so-so .
so i did , i looked at the screen & was a bit confused .
instead , i 'm writing this .
walmart beats smiths hands down .
the parking lot still looks ghetto and poorly lit as well .
and the staff seems like they all hate working there .
they renovated the place and many of the old faces seem to be gone .
the store employees always seem unhappy .
this store sucks .
no cashiers so i have to use the self checkout .
the woman who answered was totally annoyed the entire conversation .
nothing top secret .
all employees here never smile or greet you .
when i picked up my prescriptions , the computers were `` down '' .
store manager , just shrugged her shoulders .
one of my most least pleasant walgreens experiences ever .
was told by another tech that pharmacist was waiting for me to come in .
come in here spend money .
girlfriend has to use the bathroom and management says it 's closed .
no apology whatsoever .
i do n't have an hour to waste , yet i had to .
he informed me of the new law no problem .
wont step foot in this place again .
no customer service .
it took cashier _num_ minutes or even more to run some transaction .
no hi , no how are you ... nothing .
i was in a hurry and waited for _num_ minutes .
did n't wait so much time in walgreen 's before .
worst customer service .
i am here shopping for about _num_ mins looking for what i need .
i 'd give this place a _num_ or negative stars if i could .
absolutely no one answers the phone .
does this place even want your business ?
horrible place .
i will never use this place again .
just because you wear a jersey does n't make you a real fan .
not the best place to dine at .
i got a headache from staying there too long .
i rather pay a little extra for better quality .
did n't even set foot in the place , and got crappy service .
easy call , skip this place .
i was sitting right next to them listening , like two jealous school girls .
the kind of place i 'd usually enjoy but it 's bad .
burger was pretty bad as were fries .
the only reason i gave it two stars was low expectations for a bar .
i live within a block ... wo n't go back .
ca n't write too much about bar foods .
no thank you i will not be back .
mark was drunk and disrespectful i will never return again .
i would leave no stars if possible .
we like bar food and , beer , pool and good music .
all empty at that time of day .
there were probably about _num_ people total in there including the bartender .
we had chicken strips and pretzel bites and some excellent fries .
drinks were cold and inexpensive .
i said nope not ok it was pretty rude actually .
so ... we got the check and went on to the next bar .
the famous burritos on rainbow is gone .
we are very sorry they are gone .
it was like taking shots horrible .
it was so stupid silly i do n't remember what the deal was anyhow .
the _num_ stars is all for the shuffleboard and pool table .
the pizzeria is terrible .
the pizza took another _num_ minutes to come out of the kitchen .
we love this bar , but the service at the pizzeria is terrible .
never have i encountered a doctor so rude and unprofessional .
avoid taking them unless absolutely necessary !
i would seriously give this place _num_ stars !
very rude service being that they are working at a medical place .
i suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please !
zero stars .
this is the worst place ever .
unfortunately this was the first place we found .
there was no sense of urgency .
`` no .
no one was bleeding or looked in pain .
long story short .
after about _num_ hour of waiting ( maybe longer ) .
i waited another _num_ mins for him to arrive .
waiting another _num_ mins .
worst medical facility ever !
it was nasty .
it was so rude .
finally when the dr. showed up and who was probably the worst dr .
he had such an awful attitude the minute he walked in the door .
he was so rude and condescending !
he was so rude i just got up and walked out on him .
i just left this place and had to write a review .
i was n't even seen and i am already disappointed .
only facility close to my house that is open _num_ hours .
i used to work at an urgent care so i know how it works .
i know for sure i am not coming back here again .
it made a bad impression on me .
it 's been _num_ hours now and still _num_ people ahead of us .
i entered with my sick little boy .
after _num_ min , we had n't even been entered in the system yet .
i left and went west down tropicana to urgent care extra .
the receptionist input my info while i was filling out paperwork .
we were outta there within _num_ min .
the worst urgent care i have been time .
they really listen to your problem & do their best to access it .
that being said , the actual service here is ridiculous !
aside from that , the waiting room is freezing !
then fremont or one of the healthcare partners companies is covered under your insurance .
wrong !
still fill out the same paperwork you did when you first came here .
_num_ minutes pass and they call your name .
do n't worry there are only _num_ people on front of you .
a little long but not a terrible wait right ?
wrong again .
should n't be long .
now the doctor comes in and check you out for maybe _num_ minutes tops .
the technician was rude right from the start .
what a waste .
disappointed in our health care system .
she spent maybe _num_ minutes with me and left .
if i can avoid it i 'm never going back .
terrible waste of time .
def gon na have to see a real doctor soon .
i avoid this place at all cost .
seriously , the worst customer service ever .
- me : so tim , can you fix it ?
- tim : nope , no idea its pretty straight forward .
if you need a screw or a part , go to hd .
they will find some excuse about it .
( i just bought the plant a week before . )
two lazy people walking around not doing anything .
not going to shop at that location again .
they have the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
i tried to give them multiple chances and every time they have messed up .
mac 'n ' cheese is super inconsistent .
the cheese can be super thick , super thin or chunky .
mashed potatoes are usually a little more consistent .
it 's a _num_ min wait for a chicken breast .
do n't waste your time at this location .
does pizza hut run out of pizza ?
as for the food , i 've seen better .
first time i have ever given a _num_ star ever as a review .
the _num_ star is due to its el pollo loco taste .
the wait was horrible .
my chicken ended up only warm .
just this one tends to be a lot slower .
this location disappointed me .
everything sucked .
the chicken was dry and came in small pieces .
the mashed potatoes had nothing special about them either .
i did n't even bother with the tortillas .
the service was also pretty bad .
he would also keep forgetting what people ordered .
very very bad service .
they are always looking to rip off .
i do n't even think a complete review is necessary !
me : i would like a breast and a wing .
me : ok , how long ?
employee : yeah none is ready .
employee : ok but will be _num_ minutes .
employee : yeah but is _num_ minutes you wait .
enough said !
no words other than lazy come to mind .
of course the cashier said no problem .
she apologized and have me the missing packets .
ridiculous .
very unhappy with the el pollo loco here .
very unhappy .
if i could , i probably would 've wanted to talk to a manager .
rude .
and obviously hate being there ... .
the place is never packed at those hours .
_num_ or _num_ people at the most not that hard or a job .
maybe they 'll get more business and better tips !
are you kidding me ?
this is an insult to the regular customers .
not insult with a _num_ cent box of candy .
when she called , the owner confirmed that it was indeed there .
no bag .
no good .
portions are very large , food is good , not great .
two entrees , one margarita and tip , $ _num_ for rice and beans ?
food was ok , but not spectacular .
very mediocre .
i went based on the ratings here but was very disappointed .
for the price , i would expect a lot better .
my carnitas were nothing short of disgusting , both in looks and taste .
she smiled and walked away .
i can only guess she did n't care .
this was our worst meal during our _num_ day vegas vacation .
the food here is mediocre .
quality like this makes me just want to cook and drink at home .
even blast some mariachi music too !
believe me , the tacos alone will fill you up .
except the rice was not so good , bland in taste .
_num_ tortilla come on ?
used to be excellent .
now , too overpriced , commercial , and service is n't that great .
both of these unfortunately lacked on my recent visit .
i 'm sorry too .
`` your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning . ''
guess my original review was right on .
i left and the returned , still no service .
quit watching the game and get me our drinks .
this is a terrible way to keep customers .
not sure we will return .
worst apartments ever .
i would stay very far away from here ... very shady management .
this place has bugs problem .
however customer service is key .
real a $ $ holes .
should not even be in business if this guy represents them .
however , nothing is ready when promised .
i will not be going back !
the communication was poor and the focus on customer service was lacking .
i walked in and there were no other customers there .
it took about _num_ minutes for someone to look over and acknowledge me .
he went to another representative and requested it be separated .
i ordered mixed veggies with tofu and hot tea - $ _num_ ?
that sucks .
there are any number of better thai places than this .
by the way , this happened to us about _num_ years ago .
and the owner is a bad singer !
girl was so so rude !
was that too harsh ?
i was driving down decatur and noticed their lunch special advertisement on the building .
ummm , wrong !
um ok -- sorry that is all that i have right now .
the food is garbage , and the service is worse .
the food was good but extremely overpriced .
the house fried rice was uber mushy and under flavored .
first impression when walking in was , cheesy .
the place smells pretty bad .
will definitely not be going back .
the restaurant has no atmosphere and the tables are too crowded together .
the food is mediocre and for the size of the portions , overpriced .
admittedly , it was _num_ months since my last visit .
idk , but my pad thai was awful , and yellow !
my love 's dish was also worthless .
went there tonight to ask about purchasing custom uniforms for my kids basketball team .
horrible dirty place and horrible customer service skills .
they are such a horrible company !
i 'd give them zero stars if possible .
he insisted to take me and i allowed him to proceed .
alex did a fast and mediocre service .
he just took me because the money .
if you are just looking for great smoothies , then this is the place .
anything else , sucks !
case in point : i took my wife and two boys there for lunch .
this is where the fail is .
waited _num_ min before the girl told us its a _num_ min wait ... .
avoid !
also , they messed our smoothies up and mixed up our order .
downright terrible !
worst customer service ever !
does the management not check their yelp account ?
then after i got my smoothie it was tasteless .
no taste of fruit whatsoever .
i am never coming back to this horrible location .
i wish yelp gave the option to not give any stars .
give you wrong food .
he was nice but still was not following health codes .
not impressed by this location .
disaster .
worst tropical smoothie in vegas .
horrible .
the rude employee named jasmine says `` so are you gon na order ? ''
i love tropical smoothie , but the wait here at this location was ridiculous .
will not return to this location .
really disappointed .
i walk in and no one welcomed me .
i stood in line for _num_ mins and no one took my order .
they do n't have good customer service !
this location was disgusting .
i ended up getting two turkey wraps .
the tomatoes were bad and the turkey was dry .
the whole wrap was a disgusting mess .
i 'm forced to give this place one star .
waited almost a half an hour for nothing .
hire or schedule more employees !
every time i come here , their service is super slow .
do n't come here if you 're in a hurry .
sometimes the wait is like _num_ minutes long just for one drink .
this wait here is ridiculous .
this place is the worst !
management should hire more employees .
id hate to be them .
anyway my sunset sunrise smoothie was good .
the chipotle flat bread was okay .
this is my second attempt to visit this tropical smoothie .
there is only one employee working .
only _num_ employee was working .
our smoothies were chunky and tasted terrible !
she said that adding the second test would give complete results .
i accepted the fee of $ _num_ .
she said for $ _num_ , she recommends a third test .
the third test would definitely produce complete results .
so i just gave away $ _num_ with no results !
no thank you .
i do n't want to know the cost of the fourth test .
asked the groomer to do a complete shave , short everywhere .
my dog 's entire face and neck are still covered in fur .
she looks terrible !
they refused to book an appointment for the mistake to be corrected .
weird part is that i originally booked the groomers through the hospital .
my poor dog .
poor wallet too .
the grooming service here has been terrible twice .
disgusted .
all this within _num_ week my dog saw a doctor and got checked in .
walked in , and the cashier was pretty friendly .
no big deal , i did n't want the other items anyway , apparently .
horrible .
i gave it all to my dog ... atleast someone was happy that night .
not a fan .
no thank you , never again .
there are way too many better options for similar prices .
we waited a while , and drank our drank .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
the staff are n't at fault at all .
the tacos was soaking wet with oil .
+ dollar chicken tacos on wednesdays .
- dollar chicken tacos on wednesdays !
i used to live near this roberto 's .
do n't say that no one warned you .
it smelled and tasted like mildew - absolutely disgusting .
my mom filled it with dr. pepper again and it was horrible .
the soda smells and tastes like mildew .
this was stared our party down for the remaining time we stayed .
it was getting uncomfortable .
i already filed a report to the health department .
a name .
with a picture .
i am very disappointed .
the soda fountain smells like mildew !
i hate this gym .
the ladies locker room is atrocious .
it literally smells like dirt and not occasionally .
i used to like this gym , but i refuse to go back .
so a gym is a gym .
the toilets in the locker room are pretty disgusting and it smells .
sometimes it smells and it 's not necessarily the people around me .
the place is not that bad but its really crowded on late afternoon .
the `` restroom '' it 's so filthy and nasty .
everytime i used their bathroom there 's so many crap around .
ca n't help it there 's so many rotten people around this place .
nothing special .
but occasionally i think , let me give it another shot .
but most of the time , it 's disappointing and i regret my decision .
why was this girl getting ready like she was going to wet republic .
i say meh because there 's nothing that great about this gym .
put a damn fan on the floor , u cheap management people .
it gets really hot down there , especially during the summer .
the ac is not even adequate .
cheap , ghetto gym at its finest .
the associate was helpful , but could not find the policy .
broken equipment stays broken for weeks on end .
this place sucks at maintenance .
there 's only one reason to go to this gym - location .
oh , and it 's cheap .
during the gym rush hours , there is a major lack of weights available .
i 'm not from vegas but i 'm a member of _num_ .
it sucks that u have to pay just to use a locker .
horrible management .
i recently came back from my vegas vacation with my boyfriend .
my boyfriend wasnt a member of _num_ hr .
the staff does n't really go out of there way to help you .
the parking sucks and the lot is filthy .
however , i cant speak for anyone else at the gym .
had a cold sore on his lip so that was very questionable .
not to mention that the pt look like shady characters .
gym was ok , a bit crowded at times , but nothing too terrible .
after that , they kept charging me .
they turn down potential customers here .
that 's not how you treat potential customers .
she runs late for most her classes but this is ridiculous !
poor management skills .
worst service ever .
i 'm actually really excited to go to a better more focused gym .
that one seemed really ghetto and the service was unacceptable .
never again , do n't even step foot in there .
this gym does not replace old or broken equipment .
their steam room needs a serious remodel .
of course other _num_ hours are much better than this one .
$ _num_ for one hour is ridiculous .
poor customer service !
the most disgusting gym i have ever been to .
the men 's locker room is the equivalent of a gas station restroom .
i would not recommend this gym .
just converted to a super last week .
no courtesy visit .
ok i 've been going here forever but i only take classes .
the window was broken and stayed broken for about a month or longer .
the gym looks really nice , but the service is crappy .
this was my gym , had a membership .
my girl and i just landed in las vegas .
it should n't be so hard to accommodate loyal customers .
dislike _num_ hour fitness off west tropicana .
not impressed .
and i knew locker room n bathroom was dirty .
but i did n't take it serious because it was always busy .
locker room and restrooms were clean !
not like this location .
even after remodeling i 'm not sure why they were closed for _num_ days .
i 'm gon na look for different gym or start going to other location .
its no wonder why this location has a bad reputation for its rude staff .
looks like ill get a membership at another location !
i contacted member services to place my account on freeze for _num_ months .
mind you , this is the send time this has occurred .
my boyfriend been customer with them for _num_ years .
goodbye _num_ hour fitness tropicana , las vegas .
it is suck so bad !
that gym team is horrible !
the shower doors had been taken off all eight of the shower stalls .
it looked like the entire place had n't been cleaned since the dark ages .
it was disgusting .
they are not provided like at the rainbow location .
i will never come back to this location , it was absolutely disgusting .
i will not be back .
the customer service here is terrible .
if you do n't like being lied to then do not use this company .
they said they would refund me the money on my credit card .
if i could leave negative stars i would .
no calls , no emails .
then i spoke with linda in the office .
she promised me a quote by the end of the day .
no quote .
one star .
this place is not worth ordering from !
the service was also horrible !
not to mention , the complaint about the pizza was also not taken lightly !
i have never had such horrible service or food !
i would definitely suggest rosati 's pizza instead !
the chicken fingers looked overcooked and it was stale as were my fries .
he never apologized or offered any compensation .
wish i could post pictures so you could see how horrible this place is .
the toppings inside the calzone were cold as well .
the sauce was straight from a can ... this place was slow .
i would never recommend this place and they have bad business owners .
was the worst pizza i 've ever eaten in my life .
vegetables was uncooked .
just had a terrible , terrible experience at this place .
he said he understood and asked me to leave the office .
i feel very sorry for his employees .
does not honor yelp discount beware !
i generally dont like to give negative reviews .
the chicken pizza with white sauce and tomatoes was a chopped breaded chicken patty .
called for delivery _num_ miles away ... took _num_ hours .
avoid this train wreck .
do not order delivery from this place !
they forgot our dipping sauces , and the food was cold .
always sound so bitter over the phone .
_num_ more minutes later and still no pizza !
the pizza is terrible !
the sub was even worst .
it is a waste of time and money .
that 's where it stops .
the quality of the food is just not good !
your cheese is cheap .
i bro g the pizza home , not the service .
did n't even ask me nicely .
do n't support places like this !
he would n't even give me basic information without a very bad attitude .
avoid this place rude employees and worse service .
very stupid .
had a horrible experience with this place .
rude management and the worst service .
plenty of better options in town .
and on top of that , the lasagna was spaghetti instead .
horrible tasting on both and child as well .
_num_ '' pepperoni was $ _num_ .
at one point they were out of coke and salsa .
as far as menu is concerned , sushi factory was pretty spot on .
the only thing that pissed me off after that was the service .
they were slow and forgot orders .
i already have a bread a butter all-you-can-eat sushi place .
i probably ate _num_ % of my meal , not including the rice .
the service was horrible .
the prices were pretty high and their food quality is sub par at best .
i thought that was really weird .
i do n't like this place .
it is a waste of time and money .
i ate here for valentines day it was sooooo busy .
it was probably like that because it was a holiday like valentines day .
the worst was the food gave me diarrhea .
i will not go back again .
this place everytime i used to go there , smelled gross .
the service was n't too great either .
sushi factory was my first all you can eat sushi spots since _num_ .
good prices , but the service and food usually suck .
i ca n't give half a star so one star will be my rating .
it says `` _num_ minute limit '' on their menu .
: hit or miss when it comes to the freshness of their fish .
sometimes it 's on , sometimes it 's off .
when my friends and i eat here , we 're like _num_ deep .
i 'm charging for pictures next time .
horrible .
would give a zero rating if possible .
food is average but just takes too long .
worst experience ever .
i always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review .
when i arrived i was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly .
i did the ayce with my date .
one of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it .
thank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with .
do n't want to go into any detail on this .
needless to say , this last trip was well , my last .
big mistake .
food appearance - lacking to the point of being `` iffy '' .
the nigiri fish to rice ratio was skimpy and cut uneven .
some of the fish was barely cool to room temp .
otherwise , the service was always bad .
bad first impression right ?
but again , the price is much lower than other places .
i asked how long it would take and i was told _num_ minutes .
i hung up with my dad and called the restaurant directly .
if he did not have somewhere to be he would have gladly waited .
but again she said she would not take an order from me .
that is terrible customer service .
makes no sense .
not to mention the loss of future customers i would have recommended .
the prices were n't even that great and neither was the food .
wonder there was no wait , the place is n't much to brag about .
this place is n't worth it .
this sushi was disgusting .
the service was horrible and everything i tried tasted like charcoal : burnt .
sushi is n't just deep fried and full of cream cheese .
they even overcharged my card by $ _num_ !
if i could give them no stars , i would .
used to come here with friends for a cheap and decent meal .
the place looked like no one had cared for it for a while .
service started off with a bang .
about _num_ minutes after not receiving anything , we asked about our orders .
our waitress said she would check and never returned .
very , very frustrating .
like i said the rolls were so-so as always .
the fish to rice ratio favors the rice .
after the night we had , i doubt i 'll be coming back again .
but for $ _num_ ayce we really did get what we paid for .
$ _num_ for ayce .
disgusting !
such a disappointment .
a bit slow but i blame the sushi chefs for that .
the chefs ' sushi making seemed very inexperienced .
the rice seemed like it all falling off .
ugh .
overall , i will not be coming back .
that 's so laughable .
she replied `` im not japanese '' okay .
wrong !
it was horrible .
worst service !
( & still did n't get any food !
well they had _num_ chefs last night .
ayce sushi during dinner always have more than _num_ chefs , promotion or not .
_num_ ) when i walked in , there was n't even a host stand .
_num_ ) the hosts waiting list was on little sheets of loose leaf paper .
_num_ ) that was the cheapest looking sushi place i have ever been to .
ugly wall colors and decor .
the menus were dirty and i didnt see any asian customers inside .
all i ordered was one california roll and it was n't good at all .
probably the worst california roll i 've ever had .
epic nom nom fail !
if you like sushi , do n't come here .
there were _num_ people waiting in front of us .
i regret the day that i contacted this company .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this could possibly be one of the worst companies i have ever worked with .
do not rent or work with this company in any regard .
poor customer service , horrible communication .
this business is terrible .
john brown is super sketchy and now his office wo n't answer the phone .
i am worried that i wo n't even get my security deposit back .
avoid this company !
horrible .
can not say enough about how bad this company is .
i should 've followed my gut when i first walked through the doors .
waiting for more than _num_ minutes to be greeted .
i left with a lot less on the top , and the sides uneven .
i mentioned the sides were uneven and he said they were n't .
should 've gone with my gut .
hair looks bad and i 'm unhappy .
had to go get it fixed elsewhere .
ill give them the benefit of the doubt , again .
as a stylist why would you book _num_ min .
apart knowing it will take longer than _num_ minutes to cut and highlight .
long story short , the end result was horrible .
he just sat in the chair playing with his phone .
he does n't know what he 's doing .
i 'm sure he knew how horrible he messed up my hair .
it could n't be anymore obvious !
ten minutes went by and my car was still parked outside the garage .
i bit my tongue and folded my arms and waited another ten minutes .
no one was there ... .
unfortunately , their will be no next visit .
it must have been in pretty bad shape the manager said .
they lost a customer today .
they were acting like my car was falling apart or something .
they lie through their teeth as well .
the building is also a huge health hazard with the waiting room .
i need to get a smog on my car .
it 's a three bay garage and the smog check station .
i figure _num_ minutes , in and out .
i 've now been here for _num_ min and my car has n't moved .
i 'm not normally impatient .
but i would have paid $ _num_ to save the time .
they gave me a small list of things that needed to be done .
basic , basic , basic .
i 'm really not into this sally 's at all .
the staff is not very helpful at all , actually they are kinda rude .
in this economy its there lose because i will never go back again .
very rude and racist .
what the hell do i need to steal anything from sally 's for ?
but when we went to ring up - complete disaster .
long story short , at the end we found out we could use it !
`` just use it next time . ''
it 's not surprising , since it 's vegas .
plus , the spicy tuna did not have the mayo .
it was just straight up tuna .
they were all pretty meh , except for the unagi .
overly priced food .
sushi is overpriced and not enough portions .
if i could give zero stars i would .
everything was served quick , and i mean very quick .
only got chinese on this visit so perhaps the sushi is better ?
really did n't wo n't to go looking for a place to dine .
the wait staff was slow and at times just disappeared .
this should have been a clue to us .
chicken chow mien was too soupy and just okay .
it was nothing to write home about it .
the service was very disappointing , because they were not very busy at all .
but again , i did n't actually taste them .
the lack service killed this place for me .
service was slow and not attentive .
our sushi sat at the sushi counter for _num_ mins .
the other food we got was cold and not very good .
took over _num_ hours to eat for _num_ people .
the food is mediocre and very not worth the wait .
the oyster place in the same hotel is a better choice .
service soooo slow .
the _num_ rolls we ordered were very small and kind of sloppy .
we ate , or tried to eat here tonight .
mine did not have the avocado in it .
no -- -no .
this attitude totally sucked .
it 's been probably over five years now .
this restaurant was just ok nothing special .
appetizer for _num_ pieces of shrimp tempura and veggies was $ _num_ .
tempura was also falling off the shrimp as if it was half breaded .
i can see if the restaurant was packed , but it was not .
egg drop soup should not be like stew .
the one on my bathroom fell on my toilet and broke it .
also , there is a serious stray cat problem .
i would never recommend this place to my worst enemy !
they protect their friends living here not the rest !
etc worst experience i 've had ever !
well decided to wait ten minutes i said to myself would hurt .
i do not want to have anything to do with these people .
notice this place has no good reviews ?
avoid this place like the plague and save your money .
absolute ripoff .
way wrong .
did n't even get a full _num_ minutes .
avoid this place like the plague .
i walk out bad attitudes do n't have time to waste .
horrible just horrible !
do not waste your money .
not a masseuse at all .
just say no and do n't waste your time .
do n't drop off your packages here whatever you do .
i was told that fedex would have picked it up last week .
during all this time , no one bothered to even look for it .
i 've been here on several occasions in the _num_ months .
i 've made _num_ purchases : _num_ dresses & _num_ tank top .
only _num_ out of _num_ have managed to hold up through _num_ wash .
i like this clothing store chain but this location is just straight ghetto !
had maybe like _num_ items .
and this place was large but their items weak .
where is my chicken and potato or chicken and string beans ?
my mom flew in for a visit and was craving chinese .
( not what i asked for but great !
nope did n't understand .
just maybe not @ this location .
very disappointed !
bad customer service .
i wo n't be back here again .
stupid !
closest panda express to my house ( unfortunately ) .
customer service could be better too .
9pm wed nite .
_num_ % or more entrees not available .
ordered simple orange chicken because most bins were empty .
nuggets were like rocks .
dry and flavorless .
there is none .
rude , bored employees .
if i was the owner , i 'd spend more time here .
you wo n't see me back here again .
the portions were small and the food had been sitting out a long time .
car trouble sucks .
what 's worse is finding a place to fix it .
no big deal .
it did n't sound too costly , so they repaired it .
they made my car worse off than when i brought it in .
and driving with your chains on concrete is n't good either .
no refund on chains , which they never told us at first .
not cool man , not cool .
totally unsatisfied .
i had scheduled a _num_ am appointment the day before .
needless to say , i was pissed .
he walked up to me and started small talk with me about my car .
how old it was , where i got it , etc .
i could not believe it !
fix my car already !
but the story does not end there .
next day , i did not even give them a smile .
there was a strong smell and smoke coming from my brakes .
i went to just brakes since that 's where i get my pads replaced .
i was n't gon na pay that price .
on the way home , my car broke down on tropicana and rainbow .
i did not have to pay for the towing .
there was no problem with my car this time .
the help in this place really sucks and they do n't know shit !
i left pissed off !
just bad service .
nothing good about this place .
as soon as i walked in i immediately got a bad feeling .
all the employees looked at my brothers and i in a weird way .
i brushed it off and walked in to pick up a few items .
they said no thanks .
we all put our items back and walked out .
i 've never been disrespected like that in my entire life .
do not take your car to pep boys .
pep boys are known as thieves and try to rip you off .
the cost is $ _num_ .
but they still insisted that i need to replace a/c with new parts .
no replacement on any part was necessary .
it only cost me $ _num_ against $ _num_ .
i left without buying anything and will not be returning .
i will drive an additional _num_ miles to another location next time .
this place is complete bs .
i say fine get it , dot need it but get it .
about fifteen minutes passed and my car entered the service bay .
unacceptable .
this is the worst place ever .
also i waited for over _num_ hours .
the absolute worst service center ever .
long story short they did not have them .
never again total idiots here .
excuse me ?
negative !
these guys are complete scam artist , do n't go !
the cashier lady was super nice .
absolutely the worst possible customer service !
but no thank you .
waste of my time .
horrible horrible .
then why did n't you tell us that before we came down ?
what is wrong with this place ?
came here on a wednesday with an appointment , it looked slow .
i asked for my keys back & they wouldnt let me leave .
the bathroom is disgusting !
they drove my car around so i couldnt leave .
now _num_ hrs later , i am still here !
it should n't take this long for an oil change .
poor crappy place !
if this is the standard of customer service i question their automotive work .
banquet room is _num_ stars .
i was too full to try anything else , though .
theirs had way too much fish sauce .
turns out , that was n't such a good idea .
as a banquet venue , they were below expectations .
it cost about $ _num_ a person and there were about _num_ of us .
it was like being put in the spare storage room with sparse decorations .
he was a dj and singer , supposedly .
imo it was not worth the $ _num_ dollars a person .
food was good not great and the service was terrible .
the place was n't packed but all the tables were taken .
when we got our food , some of it was cold .
for some reason , the bbq skewers were inedible .
disgusting !
it was hard to track someone down for water refills too .
really bad service .
needs to be served with more meat though !
o disappointed that this was the kind with the thin noodles .
o too watery for me .
service is n't that really top notch .
for a sit down filipino restaurant i expect better .
they were slow and have no other events or other customers at _num_ pm .
tip : do not even bother trying this place !
boy , that was a mistake !
my brother and i had a bad case of upset stomach !
really bad !
service was so disappointing .
we had to wait _num_ minutes before our orders were taken .
and the food was so bad !
i dont even think this place deserves a star at all .
because of this , our table of _num_ did not feel welcome at all .
the shrimps looked like it came from the fridge .
all the items that came in the platter looked sadly unappetizing !
i do n't understand that .
it was not a good presentation at all .
to be honest , i didnt like the broth it was in .
a _num_ dollar tip for a takeout ?
no thanks .
she took it after she realized i had no cash .
does anyone know of any places ?
first off , the waitress are rude .
second , their food is way too expensive for a poor quality .
it was gross and tasteless .
it was such a disappointment going there .
lack of training , or lack of brain ?
the food also tasted like garbage .
so unorganized and let me tell you very rude .
the food i ordered was horrible .
very tasteless and way too greasy .
whoever their buyer is for their food does n't know what to order .
it should have no star at all .
this was my first time and i 'm not coming back .
if it was truly freshly grilled , it would have been sizzling hot .
adobo rice was the same , was only heated in microwave .
i was very disappointed .
i eat this place and the service was horrible .
the waitress was n't a very helpful .
and also the food was n't really that good .
so dry that we didnt touch it .
lastly i would not reccomend anyone to eat here .
no apology from anyone and still had to pay for my food .
there was n't much of an option because it was late at night .
only three tables were occupied .
i do n't know , i ca n't explain it .
it did n't have much of a strong flavor for me .
you can barely even taste it .
it was eh .
not sure .
it s not a place to eat and to tell people to try .
i ordered several of my favorite filipino foods and was sorely disappointed .
points were lost in the uncooked , undercooked meat .
the pork and chicken adobo pieces were raw .
chicken adobo : uncooked chicken .
everything i ordered was uncooked or undercooked .
we could 've cooked a better version at home .
i give them _num_ stars for the egg .
unfortunately , i was not overly impressed .
however , as far as first impressions go , this place is just so-so .
without lights , the place looked a bit drab , and cheap .
i do n't remember anything on the item tasting all that good .
they were mediocre .
for lunch , the place was about _num_ % full during a weekday .
but i was pretty disappointed by the whole experience .
something is seriously wrong with this place .
the quality does not justify the price .
i was very , very disappointed in light of other people 's reviews .
i would pay _num_ extra dollar and go to sushi mon .
this place is so gross .
the new ones were about $ _num_ higher than the old ones !
bad business !
however , even the hot selections and dessert buffet could n't save this place .
the price point is wrong too .
and the sushi is borderline gross .
what a awful place for dining !
they just try to fill you up with rice .
_num_ minutes later , the waitress came .
why is nobody say anything before we be seated ?
guess what , they are not even warm ... .
when the check comes , it 's _num_ % gratuity added automatically .
with the bad service , bad good and cold soup .
what 's a nightmare .
trust me , i just know .
how do they get away with fake crab meat ?
i am not sure how anyone has given this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
money not so well spent .
conclusion : i would never come back unless someone else paid for me .
this place feels like a cheap buffet , loud and crowded .
it 's not cheap , and by the time we left i felt cheated .
if i get sick , i 'll place another review .
steer clear , yelpers .
we had _num_ ayce dinner buffets for _num_ on a tuesday night .
- nigiri is way better than todai .
- the desert selection looked disgusting .
sloppy .
lost appetite .
- udon noodles looked dry .
miso soup was too watery .
tofu cubes were destroyed .
- if this buffet was _num_ , then it 'd be worth it .
not for almost _num_ a person .
i asked for my money back !
the roll i ate tasted like a piece of carpet with mayonnaise on it .
the chow mein had a disturbing spice ( ? )
the chicken skewer looked to have been sitting there for four days .
you 're better off getting a fish sandwich at a fast food restaurant .
your gut will not like this food .
we loaded up our plates and sat down to eat .
finally he told me he would remove one of our meals from the bill .
the hot food ranges from bad to mediocre .
_num_ star for that alone .
mediocre buffet food .
a few vegan options , but not ideal at all .
avoid if you can .
this place is like many of your chinese buffet in every town .
its cheap and low quality food .
however , this place is more expensive and japanese version .
meh , there are so many better japanese buffets out there .
my highlight was that the dessert aisle had some really good creme brle .
had to grow to extra hands to give this place _num_ thumbs down .
i 've been searching for the best ayce .
this place was packed so we walked in thinking this food must be amazing .
we ate a little and pushed it to the side .
i gave _num_ stars cause the server kept my coke full .
this place has gone downhill .
the sushi was frozen and falling apart .
we 'll be looking for a new sushi place after tonight .
people were nice and sat us quickly .
it was very busy for a sunday night .
none of the sushi was cold .
sushi , hand rolls , crab legs nothing was cold .
my husband ( having a tummy to steel ) continued on .
this place sucks .
worst sushi place i have ever tried .
after being a customer for _num_ years , we wo n't be back .
i used to have seaweed salad every lunch time and good salad selections .
no calamari no grilled steaks and no seaweed salad .
i will not go there again .
i do n't see why people like this place so much .
lots of rude tourist also does n't help the overall experience .
she was not friendly when i arrived .
the restaurant was extremely crowded !
i had to wait _num_ minutes for a plate every time i stood up .
other than the atmosphere , the food was alright .
not much variety , but i was satisfied by what they had .
lunch was $ _num_ , no drink included .
the sushi was nothing to rave about .
no sashimi ( without rice ) .
for that price , i expected more .
i then noticed the jalapeo slices on the sushi .
is this some kind of odd mexican fusion restaurant now ?
ok , so this place is no longer a sushi place .
the salads were not tasty and were poorly made .
the soups were just sad .
such a waste of money !
i was very disappointed when i came here for my friend 's birthday dinner .
i paid $ _num_ for food that was not good .
i usually enjoy asian buffets , but i was not thrilled with this one .
i will not be back .
mexican style sushi place .
not a real sushi place .
the food was nothing to write home about .
also some other cold plate area .
their hot food did n't have a big selection either .
ummm if you hate your job , do n't let it show .
and the prices for the quality that they put out is a bit overpriced .
why is the entire dessert section either soggy and still partially frozen ?
do n't show up after _num_ .
they put all the food away at 2:30 and i mean all .
they take it off the buffet and out it away .
i have never received such bad service .
and they take away the food , of course , at 9:30 .
just pick it up but i went last time .
i could not eat any sushi .
they did not put more sushi .
they fill up only some cheap stuff and ramen is the worst .
i used to love this restaurant , but they put me to go away .
it gets _num_ stars because the value for the price is not great .
las vegas has many ayce sushi places .
most are around $ _num_ .
not far from here are better options for both at a much better value .
most did n't have any additional sauces with them to compliment the flavor .
im really disappointed .
and come to find out that they run out of salmon .
no more salmon at _num_ pm ?
i will not recommend this place .
if i were you , look for another seafood buffet .
its not worth it to pay $ _num_ .
i also had some fried squid which was decent .
it all went downhill from there .
the nigiri was a hot mess !
the long row of rolls all looked better than they tasted .
no crab legs anywhere at lunch , which i can understand its cheaper .
lots of artificial flavors , and calories that were not worth it .
the flan was the only decent thing there .
the non sushi items were all pretty bad .
$ _num_ for a seafood buffet off the strip .
over price for food that is very subpar .
sushi looked like it was sitting there for days .
our whole group came here for seafood and they were very disappointed .
this is our third visit here and quality has gotten worse each time .
my wife had a stomach that night so i have to vent .
they do have a lot of different selections for sushi rolls and nigiri .
that 's probably why i have n't came in a long time .
speaking of the food- it 's not even good !
why are there so many cooked tuna sushi rolls ?
they are really gross .
the raw sushi was chewy and did not seem fresh .
unfortunately i also did not enjoy the crab legs .
the meat stuck to the shell on almost every crab leg i had .
it 's possible that they are overcooked .
i do n't know guys , i do n't get it .
you can also get a huge buffet and endless crab legs at many casinos .
it was really crowded but from what i saw , plates stayed full .
for two at least _num_ bucks .
but no .
it was n't just the sushi .
if i can give this place a zero , i would .
this is the worst buffet i have ever been to .
it was ridiculous ... .
never ever going back there again .
if i could , i would give this place _num_ .
you should be ashamed to charge _num_ for this .
it was better there .
first off it 's $ _num_ for a pretzel and a drink .
if you want any kind of sauce it 's another $ _num_ .
tacky !
overall disgusting .
for shame rio of las vegas for allowing this .
totally lame !
and they did not care .
... having almost _num_ months passed since our experience .
if that does n't tell you to run , read the rest .
as i said earlier , they left us stranded for the return trip .
i did n't have to ; i could have gotten a hotel voucher .
this shuttle is the worst .
i waited _num_ minutes in the heat , even with an advance ticket .
the shuttle seems too poorly organized .
which was the exact same price as the shuttle in the first place .
i will never use this shuttle again .
the same bad thing happened to me !
i can not believe the drivers do now know how the shuttles work .
this happened on tuesday , march _num_ , _num_ at about 9pm lv time .
best word to describe this company is horrible !
my next step with this is complaining to each casino about this company .
has no one heard of customer service ?
this was n't my first time .
i wo n't be back again .
they could n't be bothered to fake a smile !
i wish i grabbed this young kid 's name working tonight .
he was rude to my mother at check out .
the food was good but the people working tonight were miserable .
i put the sun chips back , the female employee was right there .
i just switched the bags , i had n't opened it . ''
well it was just really insulting to me , he does n't know me .
i know granted i was wearing casual clothing , but i do not steal .
he really pissed me off .
just avoid this location if you can .
customer beware , this is a horrible outfit .
i checked & sure enough there still wet and smell horrible .
i called back to find out why he called and the boss did n't .
girl that answer apologized about it and she was sorry for him being unprofessional .
they did not do any of them but offered to shampoo the mats .
no , thank you , that 's not what i needed .
i am very disappointed .
there was nothing special about it .
what a rip-off !
i would n't come here again if it were the last place on earth .
i was not surprised at the other places and their negative reviews !
they use a mechanical car washer and dry your car by hand .
this business does not use customer service practices .
they stated they put a bag over it and ran it through the carwash .
the manger and owner guy stated it was my fault .
yet there was nothing wet inside the car .
this is not good business practices .
i advise to find another carwash .
extremely disappointed !
gone here before and many other car washes and never had this happen before .
i went today for a car wash and they have a new ownership .
i asked them what happened and they told me it was already like that .
them rip u off like they did me smh ... .
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .
i checked and yes it did not move .
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . )
i said he could give me a coupon for something off .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .
i checked and yes it did not move .
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . )
i said he could give me a coupon for something off .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
though they are mostly friendly , this is just silly .
i paid $ _num_ for a hand wash .
they did n't bother to move the seats forward to vacuum .
did n't touch the rear tire or front grill .
bad service , bad management .
i was told the wash should take about _num_ minutes .
not true .
i then inspected my car .
i could not remove it myself , so i asked for help .
i 'm sorry i understand things go up but not _num_ .
2nd time i went .
my mistake i forgot to show my groupon .
well , we fell for it and did it .
my car is n't very dirty in the first place .
i do n't leave trash on the inside and take good care of it .
and yet they did such a lousy job .
i did get a discount .
nothing special for $ _num_ .
did n't realize i did n't get it until i started driving away already .
would n't pay full price for this at all .
not going back .
i do n't even know where to start this place is soo horrible .
take your car elsewhere !
place is sad .
car was n't that clean .
stay away , they do not deserve your money .
well the inside if my car was not clean .
insurance companies really need to investigate this place for insurance fraud .
this is a horrible run business .
they said they could not find me and ran it through the car wash .
the inside of my truck was not wet at all .
the owner nor the manager would not admit their mistake .
horrible service and run business .
that goes to show their still misleading customers .
i have never see someone be so nasty and unprofessional !
i rarely take the time to write a review but everything here was terrible .
first , someone needs to check this car wash place out for insurance fraud .
my car was not cleaned at all .
this was a very rush job .
zero stars .
i spent $ _num_ for inside and outside .
yeah , no !
not $ _num_ .
do not do business with these people .
if only i had researched them before buying our home ... .
they must have pretty low standards !
horrible customer service !
the only issue i have is the toilets or plumbing on the house .
are you kidding me ?
is that how this problem is resolved ?
also during our process , the customer service was terrible .
very dismissive , unhelpful , usually rude .
but no , more lies and excuses .
any time an issue came up , it was someone else fault .
it will be a constant frustration .
they will give you excuses any chance they get .
just do n't do it .
i will not purchase a home from this company again ... moving soon .
do n't waste your time or money !
$ _num_ to $ _num_ for a fast food burger ?
terrible service .
over-priced food and an overall lack of caring .
$ _num_ for _num_ people to have burgers and fries is quite steep .
early morning visit approx 3am .
i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy .
it was pretty empty when we came .
i 've never tried fatburger in my life .
horrible experience .
first , the food here was ridiculously overpriced .
fourth , the food itself was quite mediocre , at best .
the only decent thing was the sweet green tea .
i 'd be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not .
wo n't be returning .
first strike , out of fat fries .
in total i was in there for _num_ min .
very frustrating !
wo n't be going back .
do n't expect anything remotely good from this place .
by far the worst burger i 've ever eaten in _num_ years .
it 's 11pm , myself and _num_ other guys walk in .
( $ _num_ ?
relieved the food was n't as bad as our service .
i was very disappointed tonight .
there were _num_ other cars behind me !
it got worse .
night crew sitting around too lazy to work .
why are posted hours till 1am .
this is the second time this happened , first time to complain .
service was slow , do n't go there if you 're on lunch break .
i ordered _num_ chicken sandwiches , poor choice and crazy expensive !
$ _num_ for the smaller burger , fries , and a soda is outrageous .
and the burger is worse now .
also no apparent free parking anymore .
went late and had park in back and hope i did n't get towed .
not true to the fat burger quality and service anymore .
this was worse than the first time .
my wife said that her restroom was cleaner but no toilet paper .
i 'm not sure why i 've tried these guys more than once .
first time at this location and my favorite burger was _num_ % ruined .
ordered _num_ burgers and boy were they spicy and salty !
i could n't even taste the meat !
even my kids refused to have their burgers !
horrible !
the worst ever !
a full dollar more than the already overpriced menu ?
should have just driven away , worst , liquid , overpriced shake ever .
i 'm sure they 'll go out of business soon .
extremely rude and very unhelpful .
give your business to people who want to be helpful , not these characters .
sorry to bother you sir .
my recommendation is that nobody else bother him either .
omg , i really dont know how these guys are still in business .
i could n't wear them anymore and took it back .
do they really think people are that stupid ?
these guys have no clue what customer service is .
i 'm not gon na even waste my time with them anymore .
complaint filed with the taxi bureau .
wo n't be using them again if possible .
they add $ _num_ automatically when you use a credit card .
called after _num_ minutes and she was extremely rude and dismissive !
the first yellow cab driver was nice , not too overly friendly or chatty .
it was hard , dried out , and had no flavor .
until they go back to the original recipe i will no longer eat here .
that 's horrible service .
i absolutely hated this restaurant .
the waitress was just as bad as the hostess - rude rude rude .
the food was overpriced and not very tasty .
they said they could accommodate us , no problem .
`` no problem ! ''
our host originally agreed , a party of _num_ people , price fixed menu .
do they have to have a price fixed menu too ? ''
thanks for the shitty sake !
there is no zen at this buddha dump .
great atmosphere , but the food was unremarkable and overpriced .
not a fan of the bathroom situation though .
ah well , it happens .
the beers were pretty yucky anyway so i did n't care .
otherwise , no .
the fish here was not fresh !
it was a big waste of $ _num_ .
no flavors whatsoever .
very bland .
for my entree i ordered the orange chicken .
the taste however again was on the flavorless side .
would have been better off catching a cheap bite at the palms food court .
our waiter was not pleased to have our table of _num_ .
support staff was friendly .
but one sour waiter makes for a lemon of a meal .
when i say horrible , i mean just embarrassing .
the chicken in the chow mein was not edible .
it was so fatty and disgusting looking .
it came out cold and tasted as if it had been sitting around .
the angry chicken was okay ... could have been better .
no one even turned around to see if she was okay .
not impressed .
our two boys were so excited to go for the first time .
he then walked around for the next _num_ hours by himself .
for _num_ hours ?
this mediocre , at best , restaurant has closed .
the worst restaurant experience i have ever had .
alize failed to deliver on both .
service - sucked , and they got my ribeye wrong !
alize is the biggest disappointment in las vegas .
the only thing this place has going for it is the view .
the food was bland and uninspired .
let me tell you it 's gone downhill .
the risotto was watery and too salty .
it was awful for a supposed upscale joint .
they simply were n't very good .
this is the review of the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
i was super stoked to try this place despite my hubby 's reservations .
the food and menu looks like it has n't changed in _num_ years .
the lobster bisque did not have a strong enough lobster flavour .
because it was so hard , it was n't nice to eat either .
the goat cheese was relatively bland .
the worst dish of the evening - the chicken dish .
i did n't finish my food .
it 's like pouring chocolate over chocolate - it 's a little too much .
not to mention , the chocolate sauce was n't rich enough .
overall , an average dessert and i 've had better .
this review is for the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
not at all satisfied even with the discount price i paid .
my soup was good however umm there was no lobster in it .
while both were pretty good , neither were great .
the souffl was n't rich enough for me .
we got the _num_ course wine pairing for an extra $ _num_ each .
the chardonnay for the appetizer was light and yummy .
but it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed .
for that type of service , the food was overpriced .
ambiance - positive two stars
food - negative one star
few items under $ _num_ in the red wine category .
he said it would cost too much to set a table just for dessert .
ok , that is it i have said too much .
point is do not waste time on this place !
never offered a different bottle , etc .
my husband 's duck was terrible , he could not eat that either .
no one ever asked though .
but they sure ask a lot of money for the view .
for starters , i ordered the _num_ course wine pairing .
after the second course i asked my waiter when does my wine pairing start .
our third course was scallops my absolute favorite at every restaurant except here .
i honestly did not know you could mess up scallops .
it was terrible !
however service was less than mediocre .
when we were done our bill was $ _num_ for my husband and i .
_num_ out of the _num_ was good but nothing great .
i gave _num_ star just because it is a fancy restaurant above palms casino .
service is ok , i ca n't say is great .
personally i do not recommend this place for the price .
having said that , i would not visit this restaurant again .
i ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side .
my chicken and the little side thing ( veggies ? )
it came with were dry .
and some fishy paste , blah !
the only great thing was the crime brle , that was good stuff .
not enough for us to be back though .
i would 've really had been pissed if we were sat facing a wall .
all flash , no substance .
but apparently , he is n't paid to listen .
after it was sent back , it came back still kicking around .
half the dessert menu requires that you order it _num_ minutes prior .
the entire table had a taste and would n't eat the remaining .
but alize should really just give up already .
do n't even bother with this place .
i feel i have to say about my terrible experience in alize .
but he was very offensive to us .
his service was worse than food court on the street .
i will never ever spend that much money for alright steak with terrible service .
the flavors are overly complex , overly sweet and unimpressive .
first time i was here , was _num_ year ago .
the duck breast was nearly white it was so over cooked .
never will go back ... go to another place .
drinks are expensive like every where else in vegas .
wo n't be coming back here to dine .
it was n't what i 'm used to .
kalbi was dry and really stringy .
dont think we 'll be ordering from here again .
later i found out that it is a korean run restaurant .
then they asked me if i was japanese and i told them yes .
to add on the service was not that great either .
receiving our soup within _num_ minutes and then our main course in _num_ hour !
the sushi was adequate , and the calamari was appalling .
not good .
shrimp tempura tasted terrible .
orange chicken tasted stale , very stale .
literally nothing tasted like it should .
later found out it is a korean owned sushi restaurant .
leave sushi to the japanese .
if you have ever had any sushi in your life do n't come here .
did i mention the service was atrocious ?
avoid this place like the plague .
without even asking , they brought me edamame and miso soup .
maybe some people like this , but i sure did n't .
another typical bad sign is when you ca n't order directly from the chef .
and that leads me back to what i wrote above .
- mediocre sushi at best .
horrible presentation .
- slow service .
poor explanation of sushi and ice cream .
bad english .
they are dishonest and the ownership is extremely rude .
worst ever !
sushi were terrible !
service were terrible !
prices are terrible !
i arrived _num_ minutes later .
ok , i guess it 's self service .
_num_ minutes went by again , no first round .
very disappointing .
the `` fried shrimp '' was breaded with panko .
this is just unbelievable .
after the shrimp disaster , we asked again about our first order .
of course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included .
the salmon one was pretty flat , no taste .
my husband , two friends and i went for their all you can eat .
while the sushi was decent , the service was absolutely horrible .
last time i ate here , i saw roaches running around .
worst sushi ever .
this is not sushi .
this is garbage .
i dont know what i was thinking expecting it from this restaurant .
it is korean owned , and not authentic japanese sushi .
i did n't like it.
just tasted bland .
i had the worst experience ever !
sushi was terrible .
it was so dry and did not have any flavor at all .
the salmon was n't fresh .
it tasted almost rotten .
the rice was dry and had a salty after taste .
it was so bad that even the dessert was horrible .
the green tea ice cream tasted artificial .
im not sure i would have finished my orders .
however the latest experience was not so enjoyable .
when we addressed it they said it was okay and proceeded on talking shit .
the management got so embarrassed off her actions she left the building .
fine , we were just wanting a few rolls and some miso anyways .
the sushi chef had already closed up everything .
sad that they keep change server and change chef .
today i was disappointed to the server .
chef did their part but my mood was ruined already .
service is tremendously slow .
i will never come back here and will recommend ppl avoid this place !
that 's not my problem !
there are only _num_ customers in the whole place !
horrible service !
it was the worst sushi ever .
i order roll that 's not to be spicy and it was very spicy .
worst service ever .
i ordered the shrimp stir fry luncheon for _num_ .
i was very disappointed with my shrimp stir fry .
overall , i 've had much better .
if you are a sushi snob then this is not your place .
plus his uni did n't look buttery fresh .
not that great .
miso soup was way too salty .
oysters were not very fresh .
i ca n't even right a review except for the worst service ever .
i met my wife here for lunch on the 6th .
she then proceeded to put the menu into the stand without cleaning it .
in all of my life i have not seen this before .
this is why people get sick .
really poor compared to the place around the corner but the same price .
there are so many better options close by for ayce sushi .
the staff were nice so okay we gave it a shot .
i do n't know how this place received such high rating .
not fresh and fishy .
typical ayce price .
would not come back .
plenty of other better ayce restaurants in vegas .
i believe they have a yelp checkin discount which probably gave them more stars .
would n't come here if you paid me .
im not sure which was worse the food or the horrid service .
this is the only place that does not let you order half rolls .
there is a reason why they are never that busy .
terrible terrible terrible place .
this place does not deserve the stars that it has !
worst customer service ever .
the food is not even authentic .
would n't come back here .
if you love sushi then you know it is not cheap .
i will never visit this place again .
eh it was n't the best .
the only thing that was ok was my california roll .
my edamame was mushy and the seaweed salad was meh .
i doubt i will get food from here again .
the quality of fish really suffered .
uni was brown and it tasted nasty .
the supposedly fresh oyster is not so fresh .
so that was nice .
besides that , however , everything else was mediocre at best .
the servers could n't remember the names of the rolls .
the food was nothing special .
not a lot of flavor besides the soy sauce and wasabi i used .
for some reason , they shredded the scallops .
not to mention , it tasted more like crab meat than it did scallops .
i really do n't understand how this place had such good reviews .
not fresh .
really mediocre fish .
service was friendly , but inattentive .
this is n't the case .
almost seemed like they were hiding bad fish quality .
even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow .
first of all , it was slow .
they were trying to charge me for the dinner price !
worst experience ever .
i 'm never coming back to this sushi place .
do n't waste your time here .
the worst service i have had .
did not even offer water at the time we placed the order .
the server only brought after we asked for it .
did not bring _num_ items ordered .
the rolls were just ok - there are better places out there .
will not come again and will not suggest to any of my friends .
even the pickled ginger was flavorless and harsh to eat .
i ca n't believe it is still in business .
all the pieces of the rolls were literally falling apart .
i will never reccommend this place either .
the sushi rice tasted very sour like it was a few days old .
too expensive i asked ?
not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray .
when i asked for more , they all of a sudden ran out .
this is not what i call sushi .
this restaurant should be called rice rolls _num_ not sushi _num_ .
bummed we did not have a good experience .
_num_ stars .
did not contest the sign on the door .
the sushi rice was too sweet .
fish across the board was not very fresh .
uni was not great .
disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream .
do n't like the scam they 're running for the check-in discount .
makes no sense .
the last 1/2 star is for the deep fried oreo .
not cute .
not tasty .
no thank you .
he comes back sometime later with the same dish with the same chicken cooked .
we ordered a `` popcorn lobster '' roll ...
i came here with four friends on a monday night .
nigiri was not fresh .
yellow tail tasted like soap , uni was not the right color .
they charge _num_ % for parties of _num_ or more , dinner is _num_ .
so suggesting you do a togo order instead of sitting .
that means i also know what bad to excellent service is .
this server was the worst .
she seemed like she hated her life .
then towards the end i asked for the check and a togo box .
that 's not my issue .
i was highly offended that as my server she could n't communicate with us .
she called sushi _num_ and asked for the hours for all you can eat .
he did n't try to accommodate and was n't polite about it at all .
customer service deserves negative stars .
staff was friendly , but food was not all that great .
not worth it .
i do n't recommend .
okay , great , but i 'm here for take-out .
ok , no big deal , just exchange it .
wrong !
_num_ calls over a week and i still dont have the right product .
this lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing .
price : locally they are very reasonably priced .
it 's why i 'm giving them _num_ stars .
it 's like they might as well not even exist .
i gave this place _num_ star because of the materials they stock .
that said , the customer service is appalling .
they ordered breakfast ... .
it took us _num_ minutes to get us drinks .
i would call this `` the worse denny 's ever '' .
i 'll give this one the number _num_ spot for worse denny 's .
third , our food took _num_ minutes to show up .
fourth , everything tasted warm but on the cold side .
skip denny 's .
then _num_ mins just to get our food .
i seen our server _num_ time .
the food was ok , nothing crazy delicious .
i will not return to this dennys .
the food is not so good .
the place has a very unpleasant feel to it maybe because of the location .
it 's not too clean .
not going there again .
plus the eggs had runny whites and i ordered them over med .
i signed up for yelp just so i could leave this review .
this is the worst denny 's i 've ever been to .
i do n't understand how four different servers all made this same basic mistake .
as much as i come to this denny 's , i hate this location .
worst denny 's ever !
i wish it had he option to put zero stars !
it 's been _num_ minutes and no food yet !
if i was n't so hungry is leave this place .
we had to ask another waiter after _num_ mins to get our drinks .
the eggs were cold and hash browns not cooked .
dana was our server and she was just terrible !
worst denny 's ever !
very disappointed for a dennys .
slow service but semi professional .
cold food after a long wait .
wo n't be going back to this location .
but this location is very dirty .
our check was handed by another server .
will not go back to this location again .
this place is horrible .
the food was bad the eggs were not good !
service was terrible !
she never even refilled my ice tea .
stinks .
poor quality , even for a denny 's .
waitresses all look like they rolled out of bed and unhappy .
i said umm this is n't what i ordered .
she looks at me and goes huh ?
stay clear of this denny 's its so not worth it.
bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare .
disgusting !
during the wait it was difficult to get coffee fill up .
after waiting _num_ minutes .
fortunately it was n't long till we were seated .
not nearly enough napkins were provided for the amount of people that were dining .
the worst !
unbelievable that the offered us two different table across the room from each other !
most likely will not be coming here again .
it 's very unfortunate , because the food was very delicious .
sad because _num_ months ago we had the same experience .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
shame on the city .
this store used to be my favorite !
it 's really not that great anymore .
that , she was not .
it 'll be okay , she 'll deserve it .
not a hello welcome or anything .
until today .
i 'm just so disappointed with their customer care attitude .
i left and did business with another place .
not a good start .
its such a shame everytime ive called horrible experience .
_num_ star .
unfortunately there is little choice in the desert , which i also hate .
not !
i had a hot water leak under my house .
but las vegas water district did nothing !
this girl was pretty condescending , rude and no help .
they 're not open until tuesday .
wait time on their customer service hot line is outrageously long .
_num_ minute wait is unacceptable .
she 's hard at hearing .
lady was hard to understand , even for me !
she did n't listen very well.
horrible .
can not believe they hire people you ca n't understand over the phone .
most of all very rude .
are you effing kidding me ?
i 'm going to call them everyday until i get my damn money back .
to hell with that !
only two locations remain they are in new mexico and washington .
so i just decide to take them .
never in my life have a been so pissed of with someone .
which this location does not know anything about .
the place needs fixing in the visual sense and more structure in their organization .
the doc office had an issue with the lab they sent my x-ray to .
too bad i used to like it not going back !
i hate this place .
he seems to not care by any means !
the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times .
guess what , they were out of range .
i ordered _num_ pizzas one hand tossed the other thin .
at the least they should 've replaced the order at no charge .
i now understand why they have only _num_ stars out of _num_ reviews .
placed order online for _num_ pizzas and several orders of wings .
now the crust is soggy .
ca n't even help a veteran out .
worst location ever !
eh not a place i 'd suggest to a friend .
i was just going in for a fix it nail .
the lady was just rude .
it looked so bad after she painted it .
very disappointed .
i wasted my time and money coming here .
this was on december 8th _num_ .
very messy , long lines of people .
the customer service was poor and unfriendly .
i felt like a number , not a customer .
was not greeted by cashier .
which makes sense of all the trash !
the office staff is rude and lazy .
i call and leave messages but they never call back .
it 's been a nightmare to get anything filed .
i wish i could take my surgeon to another office but i ca n't .
my surgeon gets _num_ stars .
the office staff is so rude and lazy .
overall , i do not regret my surgery , i regret using them .
the worst customer service i have ever received at a bank .
which any other bank takes to cash one of there own checks .
they did n't try n even help .
i just honestly never had someone say no n not try n help .
teller said wait for an officer .
not too impressed .
they refused to replace it , even though it was making my kids sick .
even the maintenance men knew how bad this management company was .
they refused to fix it .
make sure you triple check your home before you purchase your home through them .
they only fixed what the eye could see .
sucks for us cause it 's our loss cause we have to fix it .
do not use this lady !
the one star was for the nasty museum attendants not for the museum itself .
i was not about to leave my iphone and wallet with this lady !
the time to get an appointment is very long .
the wait time while in the office is unacceptable .
the office has the worse front desk staff and billing ever experienced .
the wait is almost always a minimum of _num_ hours .
i would not recommend and seek alternatives if at all possible .
do yourself a favor and do n't come here .
seriously ... nothing to expect here .
this indoor swap meet really had nothing to offer , at least for me .
to be honest , the prices are n't even that great .
parking is at least easy and admission is free .
okay - other than that , there 's really nothing to see .
i was like so pissed , and i just left .
please improve , do n't make me stop coming here altogether .
secondly this place sucks .
the employees are ok but the manager is incompetent .
this mcdonald 's was one of the worst i 've ever been to .
the place is ridiculously dirty .
they did n't give us the drinks with the kids meals .
the parent was in the actual dining room , not the play area room .
the worst service i 've have ever experienced tonight going through the drive through .
for _num_ hot and spicy no lettuce and no mayo !
just rude .
i wo n't return here !
kind of ridiculous .
wasted cab rides to and from the course .
garbage .
crappy club rentals .
pretty ugly course .
too may nice courses in lv to play this dump .
terrible !
never again will i go there .
this course is not maintained at all .
you ca n't find a cheaper place around to practice at .
i wish i had looked this place up on yelp before i played here .
there schedule said no restrictions !
what happened , conditions have been getting worse here .
i have a sleep numbers bed .
terrible customer service .
ran me away with ease .
boy , was i wrong !
places like this should not be running .
no one here should be allowed to tattoo .
for my birthday i decided to get my industrial piercing in my left ear .
during the piercing , i passed out ( no idea why ) .
guess that 's partially my fault .
the lines are n't clean and the ink is n't consistent .
i think that 's so ridiculous .
well there are still trouble shooting steps that you can take . ''
this review is n't about this specific store , but about the company .
this is not a way to save money for the company ... .
but this place is definitely a zero in my book .
this store sucks .
bad products .
pay $ _num_ a week and $ _num_ total to own it .
not worth .
want a $ _num_ computer ?
_num_ star is all that i can say .
i am so glad to be making my last payment to this location .
although they have good customer service , they seem lost .
they do n't know how to enter payments , change info etc .
if i 'm at work , i can not answer your call .
but you 've been taking my payment by phone this entire time .
i do n't know why this location makes things so difficult .
i 'm super annoyed , hot and frustrated .
i will never rent anything from a rent a center again .
i 'm better off going to a different furniture company .
do n't even bother setting one toe in the door at that place .
i hate seeing good people get treated like garbage .
please do not waste your time coming here for glasses .
when i first walked in , everyone was friendly enough .
so again , i asked him to quote me the price .
it knocked it down to about $ _num_ .
after today , i 'll never go here again .
currently sitting here for _num_ minutes waiting for my appointment .
why make an appointment if you do n't honor them ?
ed and jessica are the worst .
a week ago jessica agreed to refund me _num_ dollars .
no management skills .
the quality of furniture is very low end .
this particular location is weird .
the took over _num_ minutes to find me package on back storage .
_num_ small stromboli and _num_ antipasto salad please .
_num_ waters .
i 'm thinking ... did n't we have this conversation an hour ago ?
their food really went downhill .
its not that it is a dive .
the disgusting food and poor service bothers me .
the bartender will not take your food order .
then , she served it in styrofoam containers .
she should have just thrown the crap away before she gave it to me .
the stromboli is disgusting .
the whole thing is disgusting .
guy fieri needs a slap in the face !
it was as if she was on medication or something worse .
very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat .
very disappointing .
but i do n't judge a book by its cover .
it was like pulling teeth to get any service there .
this bartender really had a bad vibe .
not welcoming at all .
bad service equals no tip !
bar food in a dirty run down place .
rude bartenders .
poor service .
arrived here at 6:30 am on sunday morning .
it was depressing .
the patrons and some of the staff just made me sad .
it put me off my feed and i had to leave .
the person taking our order did not seem to thrilled to be serving us .
it was crispy in some places and soggy in the rest .
my first hand experience is as follows .
cheap .
ca n't smoke in the restaurant side .
_num_ tvs on sports channels and some video poker inside .
big mistake !
beer battered shrimp .
$ _num_ chicken wings - basic order wings , hot sauce , ranch .
weird thought , tastes yuck .
$ _num_ kids grilled cheese and fries - better than the steak .
think nostalgia went more into the triple d pick than the food .
nope , not even remotely .
i recall having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that was mostly grease and dough .
primo , i 'm not a fan of carpets where you serve food .
it was n't bad , but very basic .
no no no !
terrible food & bad service .
they used american cheese , no option for cheddar , swiss , etc .
this place is mediocre at it 's very best .
have any of you actually had a stromboli before ?
oh ... there they are ... sitting in the window .
at least we got them , i guess ?
it was piss poor .
and the marinara was bland and tasteless .
if i could give it no stars i would .
the service was beyond poor and the stromboli was a total disappointment .
it was undercooked in places , lacked cheese and flavor !
beyond that ... it was a total dive .
lets just say it was pure disappointment .
it was so dry and flavorless .
the bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it .
my friends meatball sandwhich was cold .
he only ate half of it because of that reason .
i probably wouldnt check this place out again .
it just did n't leave a good taste in our mouths .
ordered a large pep pizza , chicken tenders , and chilli fries .
not worth the money no matter how cold it was .
simply had no good taste of flair at all .
the seating was very small .
my wife and i sat down and we ordered .
i had the house stromboli and my wife had chicken wings and fries .
my wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce .
it was very bland and lacked flavor .
i was really dissappointed .
the waitress asked me what was wrong and i explained to her the situation .
she then left my table and returned with a pizza sauce for the stromboli .
she said this was what was missing .
the customer service sucked .
it did not live up to the hype and expectations .
service was courteous and prompt .
then there 's the smell .
the aroma of stale spilled beer .
perhaps other menu items are edible but their veggie stromboli is disgusting .
only some of the veggies were actually cooked .
so there were partially raw onions in the mix .
waitress was fine , not overly friendly or helpful .
this place does n't even come close .
lousy atmosphere and sketchy cooks .
i am at a loss on why people like to come here .
it is disgusting .
this is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy .
while the server was nice and polite the food was horrible .
gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was nice .
i now remember why i have n't been here for a couple years .
not anything special .
soaked in hot sauce and served on foam plates .
pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place .
save yourself the trouble and avoid this experience .
the ribs was extremely dry .
the only thing that tasted good was the coleslaw .
disappointed .
wasnt impressed this time cheese burger overcooked and dry , fries cold .
did n't taste right , and now i 'm suffering for it .
really ... ... _num_ stars ?
the service is good ; but the food is mediocre at best .
the wait staff and bartenders are rude .
they did n't even cook it all the way .
the kitchen staff clearly does n't give a fuck .
i 've had hot pockets that tasted better .
i went to lunch with some coworkers .
i ordered the french dip sandwich , it was pathetic .
but , i doubt i will go there again .
first , we ordered the cajun fries and the mac and cheese bites .
the cajun fries are just fries tossed in buffalo sauce .
the chicken fingers were typical frozen chicken .
i did not like the sauce .
it was like a canned tomato with some sweetness .
overall , i wo n't be back .
absolutely no ventilation .
atmosphere is a _num_ .
bartender is less than zero .
the food is crap at best and inconsistent all the time .
not liking it anymore .
they also can use a better bbq sauce for it .
now back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love .
not so much for me .
why not ? ''
i got a small beef taco and a chicken taco .
no thanks .
but at night they are slower than slow .
waited _num_ minutes for a burrito and _num_ tacos in the drive thru .
is was very disappointing .
then after i fed my kids the crap they gave me .
quit so someone who wants to work can do it .
i wo n't be going there again .
worst customers service ever .
she blew me off and told me i will have to wait .
people pay for the service you provide and your service is terrible .
the pharmacy is the worst i have ever been to .
they are rude and blame things on everybody but themselves .
do n't get lied to like i did !
bad service .
they tried to sell me special oil change $ _num_ bucks .
had a _num_ dollar coupon from their web sight .
he would n't take it .
i ordered a hamburger with lettuce , tomato , pickles , and onions .
i got a soggy , disgusting pile of trash with cheese and ketchup .
if you see this review , never eat at this horrible place .
within five seconds another tech at the store was able to locate it .
nothing had been done at all during this period of time .
i would not recommend using this place .
go back again _num_ days later - 10:30 am - closed again ?
price for both w/ coffee - $ _num_ .
who the hell voted for this place ?
that was a _num_ star experience .
$ _num_ menu states comes with your choice of potatoes and veggies .
we are vegetarians , do n't eat any meat other than fish .
a little bowl of canned veg all and a stale roll .
disappointed !
so limit you visits to breakfast , we will if we return .
not necessarily flavorful - but humongous .
the bad .
and the ugly .
i ordered the chicken fried steak .
the gravy was all but tasteless white goo .
the steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts .
all in all , i would not go back .
i wanted to like this place , but i was disappointed .
the food was just not well prepared .
food was bland .
i 've had several items , all were average .
the worst .
rude rude rude .
no music !
i had high hopes for this diner , i wish it had been better .
no more !
worst service ever !
when my family and i was signing the lease i was very nervous !
it seems like it was at least _num_ pages long !
next month you pay $ _num_ for water and $ _num_ for lights !
the heat you will not use alot cause its hardly freezing outside !
but , i do n't care about furniture that much .
i will leave the points for the decorations to other reviewer .
unfortunately , the server had no idea either .
she had never tried any of the food .
it was just horrible .
but as my experience for the food , it was not good at all .
_num_ of them _num_ star , _num_ of them _num_ star .
average _num_ star .
the food was okay but nothing special .
because the steamed rice was edible , i decided to be fair .
the big problem is actually eating there .
the place looks like its abandoned .
really dim lights .
no music .
no sound .
had egg foo young for lunch , which was ok .
do n't waste your money !
i ordered delivery , my food showed up missing items .
no i paid for it this time .
she said she would credit my card back for the missing items .
the only edible item in the bag was the fortune cookie !
now i remember why i do n't try new places .
get your act together chinese village !
we tried a couple of different items that were just disappointing .
the only thing that was pretty good was their egg rolls .
we walked in and everything we knew was gone .
it 's so sad to see where this place gone .
the shrimp fried rice was the smell .
very fishy and rotten smell .
tasted like it had sat in the garbage for a day .
avoid this place at all costs if you are going there for food !
i ca n't write a review about the food as we never got ours .
sadly , they sell an overpriced product .
i only went because everyone says they have awesome apple fritters .
wo n't go back .
having said that i am sorely disappointed in this arby 's .
the dining room is just awful .
what ... the ... fuck ?
the restrooms are located outside the building , not readily visible or available .
save that nonsense .
no , sorry .
this was a huge mistake .
its such a mess !
avoid this place !
you can get a over priced haircut elsewhere .
do not go to this place !
my appointment was at _num_ o'clock .
the most pathetic excuse for a salon .
not only was my blow dry something out of the 80s .
steve is not a hairdresser , surely he ca n't be .
the worst place i have ever been in my life !
-- -- _num_ stars !
this is the worst place i have ever had my hair done !
what a nightmare !
no selection , and unhappy and unhelpful sales people .
ok if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
it was that bad !
it 's two saturdays before xmas and the mall is packed .
plus the line was crazy long and i did n't feel like waiting .
ok , so this location is like the size of my living room .
the three associates were all standing by the cash register .
there were no other customers in there except for me .
i was a customer willing to drop some money .
i work at the mall also , so i know customer service is priority .
i did not receive any of that here .
worst staff ever .
bad customer service .
i wish i could give them _num_ star for this rating .
i would like to give them _num_ .
it takes _num_ weeks and then they will send those to me .
they are not even sure if i can cancel my order after _num_ weeks .
the worst online shopping experience ever !
i am never ever gon na use lady 's foot locker .
apparently , english was n't her first language , either .
`` cough drops ? ''
and whatever does , i do n't want to know .
and no cough drops .
i could n't get help because no one seemed to understand english .
such a disappointment .
she is unhelpful rude and a bitch .
the site to store has certainly been a hit and miss .
as for the rest of the store , it 's only ok .
at the end of the transaction she gives me the ten dollars off anyway .
the deal was for all week not just thursday or maybe friday .
ridiculous !
i did not like how the pictures came out at all .
and i would n't recommend this place at all .
we got there and immediately noticed it was very hot !
this was ridiculous .
they did n't even warn me ahead of time the condition of the studio .
also , their props need to be updated because some are old and worn .
they really were n't prepared for the pictures we were doing .
the girl that was helping us was unprofessional and rude .
and she almost ordered the wrong photos because of her lack of attention .
horrible employee .
they also rushed us when it was our turn .
however , i did not like our family picture so much .
the absolute and worst customer service i have ever received in my entire life .
worst customer service ever .
waited _num_ min for a shoe size .
would n't call another employee to help .
then would not honor the coupon i had .
no wonder this place is such a **** hole .
: ) the story does n't end there .
this location has been nothing but a huge hassle .
fair selection on cars and all but had a terrible experience .
by $ _num_ really ?
ultimately , i feel they lied online to get customers in through the doors .
i explained my situation and was shown _num_ cars .
interest varies but the principle price should not .
no thanks .
left disappointed and empty handed .
_num_ minutes more , no car for me to see .
i hated the place wasted my time of _num_ hours .
do n't go here they waste ur time !
drove by to check out their inventory .
everything is going to crap now !
so a week later again they call me your car ready come get it .
so a week later i get call from them it 's ready .
so call them they ca n't do nothing until the next day .
chevy told them is losing pressure in motor .
but they wo n't do it .
they will not honor warranty .
come down to check it out !
i would not refer anyone to this car lot .
filled out an application , waited around for _num_ hrs , had to leave .
i have received no phone call or e mail and its been _num_ weeks .
do n't waste your time here !
`` we finance anyone '' is a bunch of crap .
please do n't waste your time here .
i was there for two hours and only _num_ other shoppers .
i guess they truly did n't wish to sell the car .
worst car dealership ever .
first off : i hate car buying .
carmax was alright , but i hate buying a car .
the salesman did n't even offer me a test drive .
oh , and the car was on empty .
i guess i was wrong .
all cars come with a two month , _num_ mile power train warranty .
the new manager there was awful no people skills what so ever .
long story short .
the manager did n't want to work with my daughter and i .
to bad there are n't negative stars !
mother of god this establishment is king of spam .
horrible service !
end of story i would not go back to this place ever again .
( short black hair , hispanic , long unprofessional black nails ) .
warning warning !
one word : disappointment .
i was so disappointed with the deal .
but i really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos .
not worth the price for what you get .
no .
no no no no no no no .
i was wrong !
first , the _num_ hosts ( why do you need _num_ hosts ? )
told us that it would be a _num_ minute wait .
i guess our waitress sucked ass , big time .
red lobster at decatur and us _num_ .
each time is same star .
dont know why we keep coming back .
we dont plan to eat in that place again for a long time anyway !
the last two dining experiences i have had there have been awful .
he then took _num_ minutes to bring me a side of dressing .
so , then he takes _num_ minutes to bring me cocktail sauce .
to sum up : mediocre , overpriced food , served by idiots .
i will not be back .
i showed pic of $ _num_ coupon and manager said it was okay .
husband ordered the stuffed tilapia , sorry , out of it at 4:30 pm !
bad sign , old !
lobster tail overcooked .
took back lobster tail , took back husbands fish .
cold !
husband still not getting his meal .
_num_ small pieces of fish wrapped around stuffing , _num_ pieces of lobster !
no broccoli , just a baked potato .
oh , he said `` i threw it in the garbage !
now it was $ _num_ plus the balance on the credit card .
instead , he came back and gave me a new card .
overpriced , incorrect and unbelievable !
the food was terrible .
very unhappy .
the lobster stuffed mushrooms that we ordered were ok .
the shrimp were also extremely small and appeared to be slimy and undercooked .
i ate one of them and refused to try another they were so bad .
this was not an inexpensive meal either .
i am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and i want a full refund immediately .
this particular experience was un acceptable .
the staff was friendly yet extremely rushed .
the fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning .
they were busy so obviously people come here but sorely disappointed is an understatement .
fortunately for i it was endless shrimp time at red lobster .
she brings back our cesar salads which are bland and tasteless at best .
but no worries i am here for the shrimp .
made us wait _num_ minutes for our check and box .
the busser was a better `` waiter '' than our actual waiter .
it took over _num_ minutes for them to to seat us .
never again will i step a foot into this place again .
the food was average , but the service was beyond slow .
the place was empty & it took for ever .
maybe she had a bad night .
i 'm not sure i 'll be back .
laughing , the server pointed to the empty lobster tank .
he told me he 'd bring me some biscuits and left .
the server promised biscuits again , and left .
however , i apparently waited to long .
i was promised biscuits each time the server came , but alas !
one may not notice .
once the food brought out , but wrong order .
she was not say any word about the wrong order .
soup & salad came out pretty quickly .
as a former server , there 's no excuse for that .
sorry , but the cheddar biscuits are n't enough to bring me back .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated .
on the way to our table we counted _num_ empty tables .
once we were seated we waited again _num_ minutes for our lobster .
simply unbelievable !
we had a party of _num_ ; _num_ adults and _num_ children .
when we arrived , we were told there would be a _num_ minute wait .
i sent it back and they replaced it .
fortunately , the bill that was presented had a survey on it .
maybe ... no , definitely avoid their chicken .
i highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken .
very unappetizing to see .
this place is only good if you have that seafood craving .
other than that is just not worth the money and sometimes the wait .
officially my last visit to one of these !
worst experience !
we were discounted $ _num_ dollars but that seemed like a big joke .
would not recommend this place at all .
the place is kind of outdated and needs new clean carpet !
im completely disgusted with this place and wont ever be going back .
not worth it .
service could have been better .
what bother me the most was the fact that i asked for water twice .
he did n't offer us desserts i had to ask for it myself .
he did n't check up on us to see how we were doing .
only thing i liked was the mashed potatoes .
e got the never ending shrimp .
_num_ minute wait for the next order of shrimp .
the wait time happened twice .
at that point he was just annoyed and said give us the bill .
the food was very filling but the service was not the best .
our waitress was very slow .
the occasion was my brother 's birthday dinner and this was his choice .
somehow they managed to mess this one up .
rainbow trout can definitely use some assistance with seasoning .
i had low expectations going in , and they did not meet them .
but this one has the worst service !
went to red lobster last night for my daughters birthday dinner .
then our waitress was friendly enough but not a good waitress .
my son in laws steak was overcooked and my daughters steak had no flavor .
never got refills on our drinks , so we sat there with empty glasses .
bad service , over priced and quality of the food is bad .
very disappointed customer !
as far as i 'm concerned you should be very ashamed of your establishment !
we sat in the bar and we had a piss poor server .
our lobster came still half alive ... slimy and not cooked .
do n't waste your money and tip money at this place .
holy cow this place is gross !
bad food , bad service , bad location .
i only ate here because my nephew wanted it for his bday .
it was a _num_ min wait for this place ?
this place has never and probably will never do seafood justice .
not acceptable , i am very , very , very disappointed .
have never been to a place with that slow service .
highly disappointed .
did not like service at all .
will not come again and will not recommend .
how things can change for the worse .
misleading advice from calling earlier to get seated for minimal wait time .
or negatives , even .
then they asked me to pull into the first bay again .
it was insane , man .
i love pep boys normally , and i would use others .
hubby steps in and says it 's the brakes .
when we left because i know my stuff , and i said everything right .
_num_ hours later , we walk back , during the cold snap .
it was really unbelievable some of the stuff he said .
hoping for another customer service representative ( nope ! )
dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with .
this was my worst automotive decision ever .
i was given a horrible customer service .
it took over _num_ hours to fix my car .
the labor per hour rate was $ _num_ !
not even cadillac would have charged me that much .
a condescending store manager .
shame on you , pep boys .
not new tires i have a new car .
he would n't listen rolled his eyes and was beyond rude .
then lost my keys for my car .
then acted like using my boyfriends rewards card was illegal .
worst service ever .
the service department is the worst i have ever seen .
i told them several times that the problem is something other than the bulb .
and they did n't even check there work .
sorry guys but after this our accounts will be canceled .
bad customer service .
no lie i waited _num_ .
min then i had to wait for _num_ hrs just for a oil change .
if i could , i would give them _num_ stars .
the first time i went here i got my oil changed .
i checked and i had no oil in my car .
i put oil back in my car , and guess what ?
there is no oil leak , all the oil is still there .
just paperwork for an oil change took _num_ minutes .
is the slowest , most unprofessional place i have ever been .
horrible !
could n't even get the car up the tiny incline of our driveway .
im done with pep boys as is my boyfriend .
highly inconvenient and expensive for shoddy work .
the staff in the office was crap .
almost like they just did n't care ?
this place is horrible it looks nice but so not worth it .
the management company and maintenance get _num_ star .
another new thing they started was _num_ day move out notice .
luckily i fell under the _num_ day with my lease .
i hear this is becoming common in lv but i find it ridiculous .
if i could give this place no stars i would .
my boyfriend and i recently moved out of this nightmare of a complex .
the staff is rude and very lazy .
worst apartment complex and management i 've ever dealt with .
cause at this point i 'll do anything to get you out of here .
i wish i could give them no stars honestly .
turn around !
if i could rate this place _num_ stars i would !
now the taste was n't great , the avocado does n't taste fresh .
the bacon does n't have any taste .
all in all , one of the reasons i stopped going to subway .
what a disappointment .
on the side , i ordered 1/2 slab or ribs which was _num_ dollars !
they also had too much salt in their batter or seasoning .
the dinner roll was a french bread loaf cut in half .
if you are looking for a pizza place , do not order from here .
i 'd give it a zero , but i 'm trying to be nice .
when it arrived it looked , smelled and tasted like a frozen pizza .
i 've ordered here twice and both times the food was horrible .
the only ok thing was the garlic bread out of the whole meal !
this is the worst place you can get your pizza .
at first i said ok thats too long but o well .
did n't care for it .
anyway , that 's my experience .
i wo n't be making that mistake again .
very disappointing .
terrible service .
so disappointed .
i do not recommend .
i wo n't listen to them next time .
was n't happy with what i picked up at all .
the next strike was the deal breaker .
next time im going to the butcher block on south rainbow .
sorry larry , your employee just pissed off a valuable customer .
go to any grocery chain they all use gloves !
unbelievable .
such poor service .
not going back .
before they have cooked so tender no knife needed .
anyway , bought them , cooked them the same as before but no joy .
too tough and fatty .
just told myself not get ribs there anymore .
they looked terrible .
did n't get that , got ground beef instead .
two visits ago , just after new year 's i was disappointed .
he came home with nasty looking steaks .
it was so tough you could barely chew it .
he told me that i overcooked it .
the butcher refused to sell me anything under _num_ pounds .
larry 's meats not owned by larry anymore and it shows .
ordered a prime rib _num_ weeks early for christmas dinner .
when i arrived the shop had _num_ other people , so not busy .
i gave them my name and waited .
i said $ _num_ dollar for my time and gas .
because the first one was _num_ lb bigger .
$ _num_ a pound .
not larry 's .
thank you for using yelp .
driving there and back just took an hour out of my day .
rudely again at this point i was off my phone .
i avoid this place if at all possible .
it 's not the employees fault though , they are all pretty decent .
it seems like a management issue .
poor selection and cheap quality products .
no thanks .
the employee turnover rate is ridiculous .
are you kidding me ?
i 've shopped here before in colorado and i sometimes find sales .
why do they have to charge an arm and a leg for clothes ?
paying _num_ $ for a pair of jeans is no bueno !
this place if awful .
avoid !
very disappointing , they were probably very expensive too !
absolutely , hands down the worst service i have ever had .
nothing like that ever happened .
horrible customer service .
never use this lady 's floral shop .
she should n't even have one to begin with .
the shelves are usually empty .
a polite no with an explanation why would suffice .
they 're much nicer over there plus they care about how their store looks .
worst run store i 've been in .
no service .
is that how a store is supposed to be run ?
the store was n't bright enough .
just trying to make you look at the stuff .
the selection was n't much .
was n't so happy & excited .
many of the bikes had no tickets .
avoid this store at all costs !
worst pickup experience ever .
purchased toys online for pickup at this location .
total times spent : _num_ minutes to pickup _num_ toys .
this is the last time i 'll choose to pickup at this store .
i do not like their nasty restroom !
but kudos to that employee because you are doing a stand up job .
i will not be shopping there any more ... their loss !
worst customer service ever !
this is ridiculous and very wrong .
they treated me as if i was stupid .
this is a terrible place to shop .
they said they could n't return them .
toys r us has gone down the hole over the years .
not a great experience and probably will tell everyone not to go here .
if i could have rated this _num_ stars , i would have !
the guy said that it was confusing directions which was why .
he offered no assistance whatsoever .
there were no prices posted anywhere .
quite an array of choices i might add .
i was too shocked to say forget it .
not a pleasant way to shop at victoria 's secret .
let me just say , take someone with you if you try it on .
my sister had to help me get out of the stupid thing !
i looked around the store and she was nowhere to be found .
employees look miserable and hardly anyone is smiling .
people all up in bins digging for stuff they do n't really need .
there is product messed up everywhere .
otherwise , people everywhere ... gross !
not at this store .
imo , this location is n't so great .
i went in at _num_ am on a thursday .
there was n't enough staff on the floor to help .
its a giant mess .
there is crap everywhere .
she left an electronic tag on my yoga pants .
a lovely employee ignored and walked past by us .
_num_ minutes passed buy _num_ more employees did the same thing .
no agent would ever break a rule ! ''
she gave me no paperwork to sign or anything .
simple order of spicy chicken nuggets and a small chili .
fair warning : do n't get it .
the outside of a building with four units ?
i do not recommend nor will i ever use them in the future .
service is slow .
my carrot strip had more flavor .
i paid _num_ too much .
we got _num_ wings sent back _num_ .
front row usually has something that fills the bill for me .
$ _num_ ?
i went to _num_ different ross las vegas locations looking for the sleep set .
but it was not on sale .
is n't ross a department store ?
i went back to the decatur store on may _num_ .
dear ross , can i please have the sale price ?
thank you for taking the time to contact ross stores .
this one 's terrible .
i gave the other store a four star review ( night and day ) .
the atmosphere is chaotic with lots of loud screaming children .
i hate shopping when there is too much noise .
i do n't last long , i usually leave .
we did n't stay for very long .
all in all , my husband did n't like it too much , either .
i do n't think i 'll bother going back to this store again .
the shelves and racks are empty .
the store is disorganized and nothing makes sense .
anyhow i just wanted to express my extreme disappointment in this particular location .
one of my least favorite ross locations .
unorganized and messy , it 's almost impossible to find anything purchase here .
the worst ross i have ever been to .
very horrible ross i will never come here again .
i do n't know how the workers can work here .
selection was horrible also .
merchandise looks dirty and not well taken care of .
awful , awful , awful !
after our wedding , i noticed that one of the diamonds fell out .
worse then a car dealership .
it was a stressful experience and i will never go back into that location .
this will probably be the only purchase we make with this company !
so here is an update , _num_ months later .
still the same horrible quality .
this is beyond ridiculous .
i am totally unsatisfied with this store .
so here is an update , _num_ months later .
still the same horrible quality .
this is beyond ridiculous .
i am totally unsatisfied with this store .
these employees are complete morons .
they have no courtesy whatsoever .
well , here it is , another day and no phone call .
bad customer service !
i regret opening store credit here .
the size of this place is ridiculously small .
this place used to be one of my favorite malls .
but like the boulevard mall , the years have not been kind to it .
the selection of stores here is only average .
too many places in here closed down in recent years .
a major blow .
only check this place out if you 're in the area .
it has gone downhill perhaps more than any other mall in the valley .
a waste of my time .
this mall could be in any city in the country .
being in so cali my whole life , we are mall snobs .
there 's at least _num_ shopping malls in each city .
the sales associates were very helpful .
but still ... there are way better malls here in vegas .
it has gone downhill over the past few years .
we only come here to see santa .
the pictures are horribly overpriced and you are forced to buy a package .
the restrooms are fairly gross .
vegas has very little to choose from when it comes to mall shopping .
but for a regular local there is n't much to see or do .
this mall leaves a lot to be desired .
the clientele is very ghetto .
aside from the location , it 's not a bad mall to shop at .
sears , macy 's , and dillard 's ) .
employees seem like they hate working here .
in every store i visited , rude customers and rude employees .
i choose not to go to this mall because of it 's boring stores .
unfortunately this mall has gone downhill over the past few years .
as a single female i was not comfortable walking around alone .
i 'm pretty sure all of the stores have locations elsewhere in vegas anyways .
i think the owners are going for quantity not quality .
they were disgusting .
i 'm not being snooty , but dang really !
the mall itself is very old looking from the outside .
i paid $ _num_ for _num_ .
the mushrooms are gross - straight from the can .
totally disappointed .
do n't waste your time .
was starving so decided to try it out .
$ _num_ later , i was bummed .
the meat was dry .
not impressed .
just no reason to ever go back .
the roll did n't even taste all the fresh at all .
$ _num_ for a cheesesteak and a soda .
the cheesesteak was a sloppy mess .
do n't waste your time .
i ate here before but will never eat here again .
so i made it a point to stop by .
no crowd , little wait , quick service .
not particularly flavorful or delicious .
it 's alright food , i would just rather spend my $ _num_ elsewhere .
and now here i am _num_ days later still throwing up .
only went once and was not really impressed enough to try it again .
i was disappointed .
not as good as i was hoping for .
i also could n't help but notice that everything was n't freshly prepared .
made me lose my appetite .
i barely would even consider there food edible if starving to death .
just gross .
maybe the cook had a bad night .
drove past this place so many times over the years and never stopped .
the lack of flavor made me wish i had kept going .
had a # _num_ philly w/ provolone and side of chili fries .
it was all bland .
as someone from the philly area , driving by had me pretty excited .
everything about it was bland .
it was weird .
not a fan of the philly cheese steak here .
it tasted a little bland .
cold cheese whiz .
nasty food and service .
decided to stop here for some late night eats after a night spent downtown .
they just rude , `` what do you want ?
if that was n't our first bad sign .
very bland & dreadful food .
cheese , i had onion & mushrooms were n't cooked !
i tipped & i still ended up feeling like i 'm the bad guy .
i 'm putting my foot down , this place deserves a one star rating .
just gross .
not a good dining experience with every fly in las vegas in your face .
very expensive for a sandwich with very little meat and even less cheese .
this is no big deal .
go to the grocery store buy all the stuff and make it at home .
_num_ x better plus the people who work their are rude .
there is no in door seating just the outdoor patio so dress accordingly .
the philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor .
both times we went and ordered our food they screwed up our sandwiches .
no onion .
okay well he tells me it was really flavorless .
we even went as late like everybody 's recommended .
still awful service .
not to mention the two guys working were miserable .
this place has sandwiches that are overpriced and is drowned in cheese whiz .
poor excuse for philly cheese steak sandwich .
maybe if i was really drunk this would be good .
to put it in perspective think your average cafeteria cheese steak .
bad quality meat .
not impressed at all with this place and i will not be back .
this is not what i expected for an _num_ plus tax sandwich .
you could n't give this to me for free .
she does n't typically like cheese steak sandwiches .
we can only assume it was food poisoning .
they were sick for three days with it .
let me tell you that it 's not worth the trouble .
and the service sucked .
do not go to pop 's cheese steak resturant .
it 's a waste of time and money .
not impressed by this place at all .
i was so disappointed by everything .
but oh well ... to each is own .
try it , but do n't say i did n't warn you .
the texture of the meat is totally off .
paid about _num_ dollars more than the same order in philly .
close , but does n't quite make the mark .
i wish i could give this _num_ stars for that alone .
terrible customer service from the large man behind the counter !
worst experience ever ordered a ham and cheese hoagie and got a philly steak .
new cooks , place sucks now .
not my fault you do n't understand english .
i ordered a beef and cheese sandwich , which was forgettable .
pop 's philly steaks they wont let me post on their wall any more .
these cheesesteaks are no longer the ( pop ) pride of philly .
the chicken philly was over priced and under seasoned .
we paid $ _num_ for _num_ sandwiches and we were not impressed at all .
the bread was dry and the chicken was bland .
umm , what normal philly steaks have ?
sandwich was super soggy and not enjoyable .
the food the first time was okay , philly cheese with swiss .
a little too greasy for me .
an absolute waste of _num_ bucks .
i 've been wanting to try this place for some time .
i was hoping for a truly legendary cheese steak experience .
unfortunately i was more than a bit disappointed with flavor .
i got the bacon and swiss cheese steak .
not that great .
i 've had cheesesteaks in philly several times and this does not compare .
you do n't serve kid friendly food !
fortunately i did n't see him cooking my food , so i was okay .
such a disappointment .
sandwich was just alright .
placed a order for wings french fries and fried green beans .
i was so excited to get some pop 's tonight !
they sucked !
i really hate to leave a bad review for this place .
so i really really really wanted a philly cheese steak tonight .
he made my sandwiches , then cut them wrapped them and put them aside .
i think the employees really dropped the ball this time .
if i 'm paying around $ _num_ a sandwich i want it hot .
i want the old grill master back .
the philly was stuffed to the rim and there was bacon in every bite .
i never once got cold food .
i took _num_ bites and threw it away .
waste of money !
sadly ... .
and it was really really slimy inside .
so sad as i love love me some fried okra .
not really crispy ... .
kinda sad soggy fries .
the philly with mushrooms and cheese ... .
the bread was freaking awesome !
but the meat ... mushrooms and onions were really really under seasoned .
it was very blah .
i mean the philly cheese steak at subway tasted better then this .
: ( very disappointing since this is what they are known for .
nothing mind blowing ... .
charging _num_ is bullshit too .
a dollar less maybe _num_ cents ?
not worth an extra star though .
shitty awful expensive and disappointing .
god knows i was craving since lunchtime .
well , the pastrami sandwich was as dry as the vegas air .
just trash .
feel sorry for the employees .
clean shop but we walked out b/c of the owner .
horrible !
would n't even give _num_ star .
needless to say i will never go back here .
never ever coming here again .
the lady hurt me numerous times .
i really think she had no clue on what she was doing .
they were also way too long .
i 'm not usually one to give bad reviews !
horrible place nobody go here .
this has to be the worst place in vegas .
messed up my nails horribly & would n't refund my money .
then tried charging me $ _num_ !
makes me never want to go back .
do n't give this place your money !
she could of just said no .
the owner told me `` _num_ minutes . ''
zero stars !
went there thinking this place would be good .
i 'm going to set up the story so that it 's clear .
my wife took my watch eight months ago to get it fixed .
prices seem to be a little high for the work they 're doing .
too bad i did n't have much time and just wanted the battery replaced .
wo n't ever be spending another penny inside this place again .
not happy with them .
poor quality of work , poor customer service .
warranty for a _num_ $ battery .
they wanted to charge me _num_ as if i was getting a discount .
their faces changed right away they immediately became short and rude with me .
because of this attitude you have earned my yelp review .
he was rude .
i went upstairs to bay watch watch repair , he charged me $ _num_ .
never again will i step foot in this ridiculous place .
not to mention the indian lady there was so rude also !
this place is terrible !
not a professional or talented place .
i would strongly urge anyone to think twice about going here .
my feet are really rough as i am a runner .
i walked in here twice .
bad costumer service .
super slow !
they so slow !
and probably not even doing their job .
i own the business across the street and they always waste my time .
i hate coming here .
the place inside is disgusting .
the play place is so filthy , and it smells .
the one that hands you the food has an attitude problem .
i ca n't wait for the other one to open up down the street .
this is one of the worst mc d 's .
trash is everywhere inside and outside .
the kitchen was so messy and floor was disgusting .
this is unbelievable !
do not stop there late in the evening .
this has to be the worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
the soda fountains are so dirty they do n't taste like soda .
also extremely ghetto looking employees .
he said it was to make up for my bad experience .
store manager made my bad experience a worst one for sure .
not coming back ever again .
the guy working , cesar , was so unbelievably rude .
he got so annoyed that we decided to get some sandwiches .
he informed me that they did n't have any salami .
i was annoyed and got a different sandwich .
after he rushed through my husband sandwich , he went on break .
will not be back again .
so far , the longest i have had to wait is about _num_ hour .
normally we have to wait about 15-20 minutes .
worst subway ever !
horrible service .
very very rude .
she said i have to buy a empty cup for $ _num_ !
never has this rude subway employee .
$ _num_ for a drink and he wanted to charge me for a refill .
worst subway ever .
oops , i forgot , airlines no longer serve food .
wanted to get a quick bite and stopped by this place .
not surprised to read his ratings at all .
it was a real disappointment .
the only thing that struck me as odd was his offering of cuban cigars .
it 's a big cigar shop no no and something that should n't happen .
i waited _num_ 1/2 hours for her to be be rude to me !
i walked out of her office that day and will not return ever !
when i arrived they requested these documents .
she stated she would input them and she may come back with more questions .
she returned _num_ minutes later and asked one question .
_num_ minutes later she came to ask another question .
_num_ minutes after that the dr entered .
she said that was not her job .
she stated my primary doctor ordered the wrong test and also not enough tests .
she did nothing and diagnosed nothing .
instead i listened to how other doctors did not do their job correctly .
they were not happy .
what an overall bad experience .
i would not recommend this doctor nor her office for medical care .
worst doctor ever .
do not waist your time here .
she does not address any of your concerns .
she needs a reality check and a slice of humble pie .
i am just tired .
please do n't make the same mistake i did and waste your time here .
i 've had _num_ appointments at this clinic and i will never go back .
i could n't believe i waited _num_ minutes just to hear that .
the first thing i noticed was that she orders lots of tests .
can not recommend !
i was grossly too slow on giving up on her !
agree with most of the negative reviews i have seen .
she is the worst doctor i 've seen .
i i 'll recommend to stay away from that office , find another doctor .
worst doctor ever .
she never gave me anything to replace it with either .
i 'm not wasting my time even going back to her .
such a waste of insurance money .
well the fat older lady just completely lost it .
the quality of alterations is n't great either .
however , _num_ out of _num_ things the hem is starting to fall out .
they did fix it for free but for it to keep happening is ridiculous !
$ _num_ to have two pairs of dress pants taken in .
ridiculously overpriced , you 're better off going anywhere else .
( a room across the hall also complained of stolen items ) .
i ended up demanding another room because of how they handled it .
i would never stay here again .
became a time share owner about _num_ years ago , what a big mistake !
you ca n't sell until you pay it off completely .
after reading yelp reviews i was hesitant and for good reason .
the valet sucked and was full every night we were there .
lame .
i could not fall asleep and woke up often .
i figured how bad can it be ?
well im learning the hard way how bad it is .
im renting a studio apt .
that comes out to $ _num_ .
_num_ a night .
cost : $ _num_ plus taxes fees etc .
problems began immediately .
prepare to crawl over your bed partner at _num_ am to use the facility .
stayed here for a few nights while in vegas waiting for another hotel .
the first room we had was horrible .
it was so small , it was like a child 's bedroom .
our first night there was absolutely terrible .
i finally fell back asleep and the trash service outside woke me up again !
absolutely ridiculous .
we 're waiting , and he brings out luggage that is n't ours !
overall , i expected a lot more from this hotel .
this was a terrible decision .
it was a truly strange and awful experience .
needless to say , we left without buying .
overall : the rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling .
also free towels and _num_ grills if you want to cook .
this was my 6th or 7th visit in _num_ years .
bad : property management system and staff not knowing how to use it .
this does n't take a manager , just training .
bad : housekeeping service .
nobody is responsible and you just leave guests hanging ?
they lie , internet does n't work .
i stayed at this hotel as a week from my parents ' timeshare .
but to make matters worse , parking was horrible .
the concierge desk was the only highlight to this trip .
again , the location is n't that bad .
it 's just a pool and a small hot tub .
the underground parking lot sucks and there 's about _num_ spots near the elevator .
one thing you should know is that the _num_ buildings actually connect .
overall , this is n't a bad place for the price .
worst experience of my life .
worst service , i checked out early .
beware - this is n't your typical las vegas hotel .
there is no restaurant .
the pool on the roof was expected to be a regular pool .
its only _num_ feet deep !
what really bothered me about this place ( more than already mentioned ) .
not true .
here is the big problem .
i ultimately walked away with nothing .
this is how they they deal with battered owners .
jumping up and down .
ended up back at the room later in the night .
the other person 's luggage was in the hallway too ... .
letting me get even more mad about the situation .
the other guest would have access to my room & would have came in .
they delivered new keys instead .
- plumbing is loud and there was no hot water on sunday morning .
do not stay here .
parking is a mess and way over priced .
paying hotel rates for a pull out couch was like visiting the parents .
i called front desk immediately and explained everything , but nothing could be done .
anywho , the rating is just for the entire first experience .
first off it was advertised with free internet , not .
no hot water the first night , said they were working on it .
toilet did n't flush properly .
it was that bad .
sorry , i do not recommend this hotel .
dishonest and high pressure .
rooms are okay , not that clean .
i found pills under my bed , there was soap stuck in the shower .
they send a security guard up and tell my best friend compliments from downstairs .
very tacky polo !
i feel sorry for people who have wasted their money on this place .
why !
ridiculously loud .
rude staff !
they try to sell you a time share and waste your day !
i went to a time share presentation here just for the gifts .
they just would n't stop .
then when it was time for the gifts ; it was such a fraud .
that even included drinking water .
when we expressed our concern we never even received a phone call back .
they have a $ _num_ hold on you card like what the fuck .
this place is terrible .
there 's so many things wrong with this place .
the property is dated .
housekeeping folks ( most ) walk right by you without even a glance .
too obvious .
gambling is about # _num_ on the list of vegas money makers .
the store selling starbucks was adequate with a very helpful clerk .
all in all nothing _num_ or _num_ star worthy .
the room was as excellent _num_ stars !
however service sucks _num_ stars .
then our third they lost our vehicle key at the bell desk .
this hotel was not is not recommended if you want to enjoy your vacation .
no friendly staff and shitty management !
poor service .
get new keys , go back up , same problem .
: ( go back downstairs , they apologize and give us a new room .
really pissed , but trying to manage a smile since tomorrow 's christmas .
but they pretty much ruined my christmas eve .
day _num_ , we found out the coffee maker was broken .
unfortunately , that shows how we feel we 've been treated throughout .
even checking out is not accommodating .
ridiculous !
the room was just ok .
the good part is it does n't have an casino full with cigarette smoke .
i 'm wondering if polo towers getting a cut out of it .
the front desk told me that i have to check out by 10:30 am !
some staff members were friendly , others not so much .
i would not stay here again unless it was free .
from the beginning , i was not impressed .
we will not be staying here again .
i 'm very disappointed with this place .
the villa is dated .
no room service .
price was $ _num_ per night .
absolutely the worst check in experience of my life .
do n't be a cheap ass .
go elsewhere cause this is not worth it .
do not stay here !
it took _num_ mins to check because they could n't find our reservation .
unbelievable .
nice gesture but this is not a welcome pack .
they want _num_ minutes of your time and $ _num_ deposit .
not comfortable at all .
it was never cleaned and they allowed us to check in still .
we showed him the bed and he returned _num_ minutes later with new sheets .
i wish i was exaggerating - but i 'm not .
did not know i would be staying at a time share .
the stay itself was alright .
calling at all times of the day , on every day of the week .
there is no actual street access .
it smelled terrible and was super tacky .
the room was decent , but unclean .
not impressed .
i have a same experience like judy in this review .
if you lose something at this resort , you will never get it back !
the front desk girl was also very rude .
overall a bad experience .
staff : not helpful and not friendly .
room : at same level or below a motel _num_ .
at least in a motel you get a real bed .
horribly uncomfortable .
overall a terrible experience .
avoid this place like the plague !
it was ok.
( fourth floor , room _num_ ) .
however , he knew what was going on and apologized for it .
by this time , we were frustrated , super tired and just angry .
come on now , that 's just unacceptable !
and would be ready soon , she would call us .
this experience , however , was not .
tip ... avoid room _num_ on any floor .
check in was bad .
my condo company booked it for me .
well there went my night .
really , come on .
i really want to say nice things about polo towers .
another thing that has become really irritating is the endless sales pitch .
`` no thanks !
the final straw for me is the difficulty in booking a room .
no more .
maybe she can have better luck dealing with the issues .
based on that along , i will never stay here again .
the rooms are fine ; very small and the bed is a murphy bed .
they 're borderline disrespectful on this .
as you can imagine i am pissed .
so i walk back to the clerk and the manager to discuss this more .
are you kidding me ?
polo towers never again !
parking sucks so bad !
its so annoying they will talk forever even after you say no .
the room was nice though .
had a little fridge and microwave and glass cups , even silverware .
also a balcony but we had a horrible view .
we also were expecting a bed but had a sofa bed instead .
the location of the hotel is bad too .
we will not consider staying here again .
been here for half an hour and already pissed off .
i would argue this is hardly a resort .
no no no no no no no and no !
if they want repeat business at the hotel , they did n't show it .
worst experience ever !
_num_ hours has passed and still no call .
by far the worst experience ever .
sad to say i will never book another reservation thru hotels.com ever .
worst customer service ever !
the hotel itself was n't even worth it .
also , the cleaning lady did n't do anything but give us new towels .
the place looks old and tired .
pool is disgusting .
find similar deals at much better properties .
casino sucks .
this place is for midwest tourists on a budget !
basically what it comes down to is do n't stay here .
tournament of kings show sucked .
do not go to this show even if you have a free ticket .
rest of it was a total waste of time .
in short , i do not recommend this show .
the place needs a desperate new coat of paint on the outside .
it 's definitely cheap to stay here , but why would you want to ?
so i just decided to rent out a room at excalibur .
the rooms were okay size but everything in it was just basic .
i didnt see anything that was gross or dirty .
go to that one unless you like excessive waiting .
we only used the room to shower and sleep .
the room was a standard hotel room , slightly dated .
btw , the buffet sucks .
i used to stay here relatively often because they often send me free rooms .
it 's awful awful awful .
however , the fact that i no longer accept free rooms here says something .
ya ya ya i know wtf am i doing staying here .
the shower wall has a huge ball of long hair stuck to it .
we only went there because we had just arrived and were starving .
this place does not deserve any stars .
worse customer service ever !
you can find better hotels with better security .
we got no help and no assistance from management .
would i like to complain ?
big mistake !
when we got there , it was empty .
we were very happy , we did n't have a crowd to fight through .
but then it was time to get change from the machine .
there is n't an employee at the game .
but the employees were so unprofessional and unsafe .
the arcade below the excalibur ?
it 's broken , if not enough to have not taken your money .
gross gross gross .
i do n't even like walking through the casino .
sure , it 's cheap .
hell , for the price , excalibur is n't that bad .
everything here was awful !
there wasnt even a bathtub in this upgraded room .
the maid went into my jewelry box and stole my earrings .
there was no sign saying there was a safe in the room .
the staff is rude and knows nothing about customer service .
the room 's bedding was about as nice as a motel _num_ 's .
the air would shut off in the middle of the night .
the spa was on of the worst ones i have ever attended .
the staff at the spa was young , snotty , and ghetto .
there was no fresh fruit or water in the locker room .
instead of relaxing i had to listen to these little kids run around .
the decor was awful and reminded of a bad nail salon in the hood .
my stylist was rude and was shaking when she was doing my hair .
the dinning options here are not acceptable .
it had a fast food food court and a questionable buffet .
and , i lost here .
i only played poker but the experience was n't that great .
coyote ugly ?
i would n't even go inside later to get to the tram quicker .
oh yeah ... dick 's last resort ?
coyote ugly ?
i would n't even go inside later to get to the tram quicker .
oh yeah ... dick 's last resort ?
my goodness is this place run terribly .
i would not come back .
so i would give more like a _num_ stars .
but tacos do n't cost $ _num_ .
their selection was n't very expansive or special .
very little amenities .
no fridge .
no microwave .
the tv had less channels than the free cable i get at home .
so i am freaking pissed off .
so i am like the old grandma playing slot machines .
next time i will waste my money at the mgm right across the street .
is there a way to avoid it ?
the charge you $ _num_ for high speed internet .
normally the fee is $ _num_ per day .
the bathtub was n't very inviting , even for a shower .
that is ridiculous .
none of the other casino 's seemed to have this problem .
the buffet at the excalibur was very cheap _num_ for _num_ ( _num_ ) .
the food was pretty disgusting .
they lacked a lot of foods and desserts most buffets have .
( gold coast was better i 'd go there instead for the same price .
you 're better off paying a little more for a better buffet .
worst buffet i 've ever eaten at .
i booked a week in advance , for saturday and sunday night .
when i came on saturday , they sent me right to an upgraded room .
so i might as well review the room .
also the bathrooms have no tubs , just standing showers .
pros -- cheap room price .
not to mention the huge arcade downstairs !
it was such a horrible and disgusting experience !
lame .
worst hotel ever !
there were _num_ young guys getting people 's bags .
anyway , the bell people were super rude .
they sent me to a manager 's voicemail .
i left a message and never got a call back .
avoid it at all cost !
yes , bad timing perhaps .
the shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub .
also no fridge or microwave .
the smell of the lobby is pretty bad .
it smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels .
the bed was very comfy and the flat screen tv was cool .
i wo n't stay there again .
we quit staying here _num_ _num_ years ago .
the place has gone to hell since the mgm bought it .
i would never bring my kids to vegas otherwise .
okay , it 's vegas , i can handle that .
the bathroom sink and floor were covered in hair .
there 's no safety bolt on the door .
no internet .
the starbucks wo n't take starbucks cards .
especially in _num_ degree plus weather .
horrible !
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
this place is pretty old , worn and nasty .
the casino , rooms , and restaurants are yuck .
i stayed at this hotel with my bf just last week .
the hotel does n't look that great or fancy from the outside .
i like the concept of the castle but not the way they executed it .
do n't expect anything super fancy though .
it took me and my bf like forever to find it .
the casino downstairs is okay , but not that great .
what the hell ?
for instance , there was only like _num_ channels that worked on the tv .
its like a motel _num_ on top of a casino .
the service was n't that good , either .
rude !
most hotels do n't care , besides we only wanted an hour extra time !
ugh .
this place really sucks .
the hotel is very old and smelly .
the lines are long and the food it awful !
the only thing that was edible was the pot stickers .
everything was stale and gross .
a total waste of money .
con : it 's excalibur at _num_ - falling apart .
crappy air inside .
torn wallpaper and mold are your most common decor .
buffet was a joke , even for a pretty low price for breakfast .
take them to a better and friendlier place .
clearly vegas is trying to shake their `` family friendly '' image .
hard to get service while i was playing video poker .
no thanks .
the iron was not cleaned and had old , cold water still in it .
i 'm sorry but i would n't want to stay here again .
inexpensive stay , expect inexpensive quality .
too dated , too dark .
a total joke .
, and the decor is generic and worn .
sadly excalibur is no exception .
* wifi would allow me to stay in my room instead of gambling .
no offer to help me find it .
not even an offer of a phone book or anything .
it was clean , machines were plentiful and well-maintained .
pathetic is one word to describe this hotel .
the elevators are super slow .
most of the lights in your room will not work .
and the entire hotel smells like stale smoke .
and do n't get me started about saturday night at the casino .
i will give las vegas wan na be 's some credit .
i feel bad giving two stars to the excalibur , but it deserves it .
that is actually false , apart from the eating with your hands part .
i am not even kidding .
the hotel bar is a dick 's last resort .
yes , it 's that bad .
the jello shots contain zero alcohol .
oh , and the staff hate the guests .
but - it is cheap .
i 'm not a fan of this casino or their rooms .
its dirt cheap and its easy to see why once you 're inside .
rough impression from visiting the other _num_ casinos ?
that being said , it was n't a terrible place to stay .
the tram runs directly from here to mandalay bay , the conference casino .
the biggest problem ?
because it was , it really was .
toilet seats .
toilet seats should n't just split apart !
ok , really , there are n't many problems to complain about .
nothing super stellar though , either .
ok , here goes nothing ... .
god only knows what kind of fluids left those stains !
all in all , a pretty horrible experience .
checked in early and the front desk were not helpful or friendly at all .
the registration process took _num_ minutes .
bathroom was horrible and dingy looking .
but please never intend to sleep here !
did n't feel that clean or anything .
it 's cheap if thats what you are looking for .
but the next trip , we 're definitely staying elsewhere .
buffet is nothing to write home about .
they also changed all of the linens which did n't help .
it was n't enough for us to stay again .
ok excalibur is n't a great hotel .
it is n't .
it 's cheap .
we walked in and i swear i rented a room at a motel _num_ .
actually , the rooms at motel _num_ probably would have been nicer .
i got _num_ full size beds in a smoking room .
i immediately went to the front desk and demanded a new room .
i guess we will have to wait to watch the place blow to pieces .
do n't say i did n't warn you .
so why the _num_ ?
the staff was very rude , all of them .
the rooms were just plain rooms i could have gotten at best western !
she said we would have to find out on our own .
room smelled like pissed & the sheets were dirty .
you got the wrong one !
they definately are not maintained however .
the employees were soo rude and annoying .
and that person had the nerve to tell me i was being rude .
i would never eat there again and would probably not stay there either .
stayed here once , for the price i was n't expecting much .
not much to do over here .
did i mention that i was a virgin until i was _num_ ?
but this never happened .
sadly , excalibur managed to screw up my reservation .
eventually , many of my friends stayed here and i went elsewhere .
lame .
the room was an upgrade , but only in the tv and granite counters .
the rest was stuck in the 90s .
ugh .
do yourself a favor -- do n't come here .
this is the worst vegas experience i have ever had .
easy access to all of the strip and a tram to other casinos .
tacky , stinky and rude !
so rude !
for rolling my luggage _num_ feet ?
no thanks .
so tacky and rude !
gross , yuck , disgusting , stinky hell hole .
walk into most other hotels on the strip and then walk into the excalibur .
if it 's free , i would n't mind .
cheap , for sure , but you get what you pay for .
if you 've got kids , it 's probably ok .
zero stars .
the elevators were awful .
the buffet was totally disappointing .
vegas buffets are my favorite and this one was cheap yes , but delicious ?
nothing to report there .
hence excalibur .
i must admit , it was cheap .
the room was $ _num_ and right on the strip .
the wall paper in the bathroom was peeling .
so it could n't have been that bad .
it is what it is , especially for $ _num_ a night .
this hotel is now probably the worst on the strip next to sahara .
needs a remodel in a bad way .
we get to the room and everything was just so tacky and old .
the theme was just so ridiculous .
at this point i am just hoping things are clean .
took them a really long time to get to the sink .
overall i would not stay here again .
the door locks need serious maintenance .
cheap and decent , but your towers are too far away from each other .
maybe they were tired .
not so much for adults wanting to avoid kids .
we are n't coming back .
we gave this place a 2nd shot and were disappointed again .
i could not wait to come home to write this review .
it was a disaster .
advice : spend the extra money and skip the castle .
disappointing .
our table was not clean .
the bathroom floor was not clean .
the ac smelled really gross at certain times when it was running .
there was a safe though .
anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the excalibur .
the customer service is horrific , especially for a vegas hotel .
the room has carpet from _num_ with wallpaper and furniture to match .
get to the room and ugh .
um , the lamp still has a pull down string to turn it on .
gross !
there is no tub , it 's just a stand up shower .
a little disappointing for a hotel on the strip .
this is the first time i stayed in an older vegas hotel .
it 's an old hotel , so i was n't expecting much .
everything in this hotel looks outdated although it does look clean and well kept .
i did n't have high expectations coming here anyways .
every casino looks the same to me : slot machines and card tables .
i guess it 's ok if you do n't mind the old vibe .
if at all possible , stay away from here .
and the smell of smoke is all over the casino floor .
the room was spacious and there was nothing wrong .
but when i went to shower the drain was clogged !
i asked guest services to come up _num_ different nights and nobody ever came .
got tower one which i believe is the older of the _num_ towers .
if you want to risk it , pay the lower price and stay here .
not a very good place to find a nice restaurant or for shopping .
the weekend rates were super cheap .
the casino floor was a bit depressing and so were the people playing there .
the decor was old and drab .
wrong .
two thumbs down .
we got a cheap rate and along with that you get an average room .
but all smokey , older casino 's are all the same .
the place has been around awhile and is pretty dated .
i had to travel different floors just to get _num_ - _num_ ice cubes .
this hotel has terrible customer service .
sit down , little boys and girls and let me tell you a story .
sunday afternoon : we return to find our room clean .
gross !
the rooms were outdated and kind of smelled .
smelly , smelly , smelly .
when the bell boy arrived he was in a bad mood .
crap .
crap .
crap .
it was cheap .
some random false alarm at _num_ am does n't help its case either .
the elevator entrance reeked of a less than sanitary odor .
took my daughter down to the arcade .
based upon our experience , excalibur is hardly of high caliber .
if i could give this place a zero i would .
this place sucks and the rooms stink .
avoid at all costs no matter the price .
it was total crap .
so if you 've had enough to drink you probably wo n't mind it .
avoid at all costs unless you are drunk .
another review from someone that has n't been impressed .
ended up staying here as my original vacation date changed due to work .
just expect hard beds , outdated decor and slim options for dining .
the casino is large though .
besides the low price , there 's nothing really special about the hotel .
just another way for the hotels to take your dollars away .
i wo n't be going back though .
unless you have kids , no .
i understand that it was cheap and old but it was absolutely disgusting .
they have _num_ people at every entrance !
very annoying !
i did n't even stay here .
actually it is extremely depressing .
remind me to never walk through there again !
could n't wait to get back to my hotel after this !
stayed here during my first time in vegas .
the room we got was part of the newly renovated section of the hotel .
going in and out was no problem .
i just did n't like the overall ambience .
do n't be fooled !
my boyfriend and i were very annoyed by them .
- it feels dirty .
the place is nothing special .
nothing crazy that makes me want to stick around .
, so the excalibur fit the bill .
literally we were in hell !
there were _num_ of us so we got _num_ rooms with _num_ beds .
the room felt like a motel rather than a hotel .
there was no i repeat no coffee maker in the room !
overall disappointed in staying at this hotel .
ugh .
i do not know what is wrong with them .
this hotel/casino is not cool .
what ? )
the casino is in a bad location , so far from the central strip .
all of the food in this casino is bad .
overall , i was not happy that we had to stay at this hotel .
let 's be honest ... no one was expecting _num_ stars here .
while the room was mostly clean and the casino was overly smokey .
basically this was a motel _num_ .
the room had a old smell to it .
the bathroom was a disaster .
the shower head was old and needed to be replaced .
if you go , ask for a recently renovated room if there is one .
i will not be staying at this hotel in the future .
i stayed here for an entire week for business in july _num_ .
i had no other choice , i was told to stay here .
excalibur did n't disappoint my low expectations .
the casino seems dark , smokey , and old .
th pool area was okay , nothing special .
really the only good thing was the view , because i did an upgrade .
i think i will stay elsewhere next time i am there .
yes it 's cheap but that 's because it sucks .
the inside is n't much better .
the casino is not great .
you should probably head to another casino if you want to do some gambling .
the arcade is awful .
it was basically falling apart and most of the games were awful .
i won her a stuffed dog at the water shooting horse race game .
nothing special .
after the first one i just thought whatever .
they told me they 'd comp me a night .
that sucked .
although the rates are good , i just spent three nights there .
spend a little more and get a decent room somewhere else !
everything seems to smell like smoke .
lines to check in and check out were long .
the hallways seem to be a little newer than the rooms .
the furniture is very dated , but they do have big flat screen tvs .
the concierge desk was a little rude .
i 'd rather pay more money for a better experience .
the room itself was pretty good .
this stay proved that to be the case in the hotel areas as well .
only one pool was open , but several hot tubs were available .
if you are a traveler seeking vegas luxury , i suggest booking elsewhere .
the pool scene was pretty sad .
excalibur , not a fan .
i found the check-in counters & it was quite confusing .
my room was average with two queen beds .
it was a bit strange .
no wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm !
seriously disappointed .
jacuzzi did n't work right .
furniture was falling apart .
very sad hotel .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
it was fine for one night but i will not stay there again .
our room had some trash left in it from a guest before .
gross .
it really is n't much .
very disappointed .
do n't let the castle exterior fool you .
they do not even have wifi .
never again will i stay here .
our room was descent , but this review will focus more on the casino .
first off , their ventilation system sucks ass .
i 'd hate to get stuck here ... worst nightmare come true .
so if you 're planning a stay here , request tower i .
no coffee machine !
no microwave !
i paid $ _num_ buck plus tax wtf step it up a notch .
the bed was comfy , the tv was nice , overall very clean .
to me , that 's unacceptable , regardless of how cheap the rooms are .
to be honest , i would just stay away .
unfortunately that is where the good ends .
so we stopped on every floor from the 21st , on .
but , we had a view of the brick wall of a tower .
no tub was a huge turn off for me .
i 've stayed at _num_ star hotels that had better accommodations .
not cool .
i wo n't be back .
the rooms smelt like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room .
after many years of wondering , wonder no more .
our room was clean , but the furniture was in need of replacement .
no coffee maker either .
oh , yeah , no bath tub .
there was no balance at all .
gross .
my recommendation , stay elsewhere .
at this price point , the luxor is a much better deal .
not kidding .
i stayed in tower _num_ a few months ago and the elevators were dirty .
our tower _num_ room had a view of the monorail .
in this case , perhaps a bit less .
_num_ yrs old facility going on _num_ .
excalibur wanted $ _num_ and wanted me out by 3pm !
the spa only gets one star from me .
my friend and i were getting the $ _num_ spa mani and pedi .
it would have been a better experience to do it myself at home .
this was the biggest waste of money ever !
$ _num_ for this !
save your money and avoid this scam .
excalibur did not live up to expectation .
the room was dark and gave out a `` haunted '' feelings .
i do n't know why , it just felt that way .
just do n't expect too much .
seriously , no other way to describe it other than butt .
not classy , even if you are a cheaper hotel .
no wifi to speak of .
_num_ ) no water pressure to speak of in the shower .
_num_ ) where is the wifi ?
i could do it and i 'm not even a professional .
nasty .
as for the rooms ... old old old .
also has some lower priced dining options .
popcorn ceilings and worn carpet show its age .
but then again , upgrades make the room price go up .
wrong !
rooms - terrible .
the room and furniture were old and low quality amenities in the rooms .
it just felt blah inside .
barely opened , but most rooms are completely sealed .
it was burned very bad on the bottom , very weird and gross .
- shower only , no bathtub .
the worst part ?
this has never happened to me at any hotel or motel , ever !
if you 're in vegas , do n't stay here .
the room service is only until _num_ p.m .
it is n't available after _num_ p.m .
also , there are no coffee pots in the rooms !
our friends ' room was less than clean .
you 're probably better off getting a microwave dinner .
annoying .
i however , mind and will not be staying here ever again .
i had a complaint and he started to get rude and condescending .
my room smelled like raw sewage .
it is just not worth it .
the excalibur has a major con : it is way too smokey .
stay here for the cheap room , but not much else .
this place is way over rated .
there were stains all over the carpets in the rooms as well .
this show was so fake and so obvious about it .
so i stayed here last weekend from thursday to sunday .
but the hotel part was n't as good.
8th floor and room _num_ . ''
next time i will not be staying at this hotel .
the carpets are dirty and grimy and the `` stores '' are lacking .
yeah ... not quite .
just do n't expect a magical experience .
our room smelled like sewer gas from day one .
after _num_ nights and no improvement i called the front desk .
why do they even put people in such conditions ?
telephone service which i did n't even use ?
there has to better choices off the strip .
it smells like smoke .
i stayed here with my boyfriend for our _num_ year anniversary .
it was n't the best looking hotel .
the rooms were mediocre ; reminded me of a motel rather than a hotel .
the buffet was ok ; i had better ones off the strip .
big mistake !
if you 're going to pay their rates , go spend it somewhere else .
nobody cares about you , they just see you as `` tip money '' .
ugh .
i was in tower _num_ .
room was $ _num_ weeknight , $ _num_ weekend .
that 's just dirt cheap for vegas .
no room service after _num_ pm .
i maybe would have given _num_ stars if it were n't for this .
like i said , its basically a holiday inn on the strip .
i was very dissatisfied with the room .
nasty and gross !
needless to say , i did not have good sleep at all .
there are many games including _num_ cent video poker ( my fav ) .
there is also convenient tram service to and from luxor and mandalay bay .
ugh .
its dirty , and smelly the moment you walk in .
she 's rude as hell .
gosh , i was so mad !
it was horrible ... .
he just threw to my husband 's hands and immediately walked away .
really terrible service ... .
it 's not worthy .
the food is not very good , no seafood , and not really tasty .
i 've never given a hotel just _num_ star before .
same bottle was still there at 10pm .
the clothing closet has no doors on it .
this place is bare bones , and your bones friggin ' stink !
however , the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing .
my advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere .
the rooms are unimpressive and the atmosphere was ehh .
only go to the buffet if you like macaroni salad and little night life .
ok hotel if you like empty promises .
needless to say that all changed upon our arrival .
it 's a total shame that the hotel does this .
just sad !
i have never stayed at a hotel and seen this .
this was definitely not the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
but i 'd rather not .
absolute worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
it did not come with a microwave , fridge , or a view .
we will not be back .
as far as casino hotels in vegas go , this is one of them .
no wifi , but i absolutely do not care .
the lost and found department closed sundays by 4pm .
i sure as hell do n't and i am in sales .
never again will i stay in this horror place !
the rooms were not that great .
place was really dirty like everyone had told me .
everything is broken and the staff is rude .
to my surprise , he came back with a bill for $ _num_ .
guess this guy missed vegas _num_ .
i will probably not go back to the excalibur based on this .
i would recommend walking down to new york new york .
a restaurant changes , they change the sign .
but apparently excalibur can not be bothered .
but they are not .
it 's so annoying .
but otherwise i try to avoid it if at all possible .
the good thing about their buffet is u serve ur own drinks .
he was n't rude but lacked enthusiasm & was n't helpful at all .
he was n't pleasant & barely even spoke .
oh & the resort fee is a rip off .
buffet is crap , do not do the breakfast or lunch buffet .
also , do not eat at any of the restaurants in excalibur .
i 've stayed here twice and that amount of times was too many .
i 've stayed in the updated tower and the ridiculously outdated tower .
i mean , you get what you pay for , i know .
everyone knows how bad this hotel is so i have nothing more to say .
this is not a good hotel .
my bath towel smelled like smoke .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
the window shade had holes in it .
another had a cigarette burn in it .
only one bar of soap in the bathroom and the body wash was terrible .
loud neighbors and drunk people .
we were tired and trying to just get into our room .
i am not comparing this budget hotel to those .
this is not a good hotel .
the excalibur is the worst hotel on the strip .
they have horrible cell phone reception .
the customer service is bad .
they are very rude .
i woke up one morning to find cockroaches crawling over my shoes .
i wish i could post pictures to this site .
here .
seriously , do not stay here .
worst hotel on the strip .
krispy kreme upstairs makes it less painful .
i wish i could give excalibur no stars .
unfortunately the place is a dump .
it stinks .
the buffet is horrible .
overall this place just needs to go away .
i too would have given this hotel a big fat zero !
this time around it was awful !
off to the pool .
seems they do n't have a set price .
and it did n't cost _num_ bucks for a _num_ dollar hot dog !
oh ... the `` free internet '' was awful !
so slow !
i just used my iphone !
just let me walk to the pool in peace , please !
when you come in smells like some one die in it !
yeah , just do n't .
yeah , just do n't .
is n't this damn hotel geared toward families ?
we did receive awesome discounts for food and drinks .
the lobby and casino were musty and outdated .
the air conditioning in the room was either too cold or not working .
a security alarm went off twice while we were there .
all to find out it was a mistake both times .
he would n't even take it if it was in a plastic bag .
in reading other reviews it seems that this is not out of the ordinary .
i did n't expect the ritz , but this place is just plain nasty .
her response of `` we never change the blankets '' was less than comforting .
btw , do n't get in the water !
horrible customer service and cleanliness , i guess you get what you pay for .
this is the worst experience i 've ever had in vegas .
absolutely absurd !
poor delivery and preparation for this event definitely gives this place _num_ star .
very disappointed .
ok , i am of two minds on this place .
i heard of stories of people waiting almost _num_ hours .
i personally had to wait _num_ hours to get to the desk .
my horror story does n't end with this .
i said , `` wtf , ok the computer messed up ! ''
the clerk apologized etc .
i do n't know if i 'll come back to this place .
this hotel was n't ready for the amount of guests that it booked .
she said `` no unless you use room service . ''
this place is terrible .
we will not stay here ever again .
the week i was in vegas they had the computer system down twice .
do not take this risk .
do n't gamble on your place to stay .
i am not impressed at all .
overall , it was a bad experience .
too bad you ca n't get drunk off their stingy well drinks .
you just gave us access to someone 's room .
i could 've easily stolen anything .
what the hell .
another strike , excalibur .
room service '' , an awful sound at 9am .
excuse me ! ''
i am struggling to find nice things to say about this place .
the view is terrible .
the restaurant are all cheap food , i would never recommend eating there .
this place is a nightmare .
but this does not compare to being scammed twice by the excalibur .
$ _num_ for _num_ nights and _num_ show tickets .
my boyfriend and i both asked it in complete horror .
as i mentioned before , pass .
so i 've been scammed twice by the excalibur .
that typically goes for $ _num_ a night .
suffice it to say , i will never stay here again .
unfortunately my girlfriend and i made the mistake of actually getting a room here .
i 've made that mistake once and i will never do it again .
we always pull the dry clean only comforter off the bed first thing .
do n't expect anything from a room upgrade in the ice skating rink .
oh , and all towels smelled of mildew .
it was disgusting and unacceptable .
in total $ _num_ was spent for two nights there .
the cleaning ladies were cool and accommodating , no complaints there .
no bueno .
the price is the only thing this place has going for itself .
i 'm gon na say that i 'll probably not stay here again .
sucks , but it is what is .
_num_ dollar for every arcade game ?
this was the worse hotel i 've stayed at in los vegas .
okay , i admit it , i 've stayed here .
while broke in college , this was the cheapest hotel we could get .
other than that , spend a little more money to stay somewhere nicer !
i do n't like being forced to pay for things i will not use .
so have booked a room for my son and i for golden nugget instead .
horrible .
the concierge was even rude .
the key word for our experience was : disappointment .
even though we wound up getting married elsewhere , we had a blast here .
do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for this .
i get that .
but really , a balance needs to be struck .
we left the excalibur feeling rather sad .
dirty filthy disgusting place with horrible service .
and its a shame because i really did like my room .
but why is it so damn cold at night during the summer !
also , the shower in our room was broken .
i would even prefer chuck e. cheese .
- no wifi ... .
- this place just sucked .
- at least i did n't have to pay for it .
just was not a good experience for me .
this is like a grown up disney world .
he was excited , thinking that we were staying in a castle .
the pool closed at _num_ pm ( the water slide at 6pm ) .
the pool hours really need to be extended .
they do n't take no for an answer .
his toe got stuck under the bottom , and it sliced his toe .
well , its actually two free drinks per stay , not day .
then we go to the pool , and there are no towels ready .
is n't this what we paid $ _num_ for ?
the ac does n't work right .
its also hard to navigate through .
that is n't an option on my mac .
facing the other tower .
next time i visit vegas .
the room had two small lights .
the rooms were completely gross .
to hell with this place .
circus circus is the place to go if you want cheap & family friendly !
then excalibur really dropped the ball !
however nobody informed my parents .
but no ... .
they where not offered assistance in any form .
problem _num_ , risk management .
be he refused !
do n't get fooled by the low rates .
excessive charge on the internet , uncomfortable and torn beds .
the front desk staff literally has no business being in customer service .
also , the timeshare people are pushy and annoying .
no wifi ( wtf ! )
the pool has no shade unless you pay for it .
but the hotel not so good not so clean .
i booked the room for pool view side .
they said that area is full is so ridiculous .
but the pool was nice and buffet is reasonable .
i waited about _num_ days , and no one called .
i was told someone would contact me within _num_ days , never happened .
no reply .
i left a message , no reply .
i asked for the name , and i could not have it .
if i could give this dump a zero i would !
pay $ _num_ to $ _num_ for a better hotel on the strip ... .
excalibur hotel , are you kidding me ?
yep , no bell men .
wrong !
it does n't make any sense ?
from my experience , breakfast seems to be the best meal in the buffets .
so there is no `` sure fire '' time to get valet .
our room _num_ reeked of mildew !
one of the worst hotels i 've stayed at in vegas .
do n't waist your money on this filthy dirty place !
our beds were hard and worn .
the sheet corners were ripped and stained with grease .
needless to say we wo n't recommend or every stay at the excalibur again .
the rooms here are dingy and outdated .
it is nowhere worth $ _num_ .
the bathrooms are gross .
the towels are cheap and stiff .
i would only stay here again if i was desperate .
you will waste your money and come out sick or hungry or both .
* check in area is old looking and long lines .
i just ignored them even when they are just saying good morning .
* the casino is depressing looking .
* there are no good restaurants in this hotel .
mediocre at the best .
i think this was one of the reasons we got sick .
there were hardly people there and it was n't fun at all .
will not stay here again , there are better options at the strip .
it looked pretty outdated and is mostly slots .
overall , a very depressing atmosphere .
the wife and i had no choice .
this place was awful .
i have made a point to avoid this place since .
i stayed here because i was forced to and i would never come back .
so i went without water in the desert .
even the lamp was hard to turn on .
it 's just too bad that they 're stuck at this crappy hotel .
what a sad , tired , shit hole this place is .
but it 's a sad , tired , shit hole nevertheless .
it was kind of gross .
this _num_ year old property still has no wi-fi .
the low ceiling and poor lighting are kind of depressing .
my advice for an old , rundown property like this ?
the first time was january _num_ .
checking in earlier costs money - $ _num_ .
third - the room is not horrible but it 's not great .
and ... ... the walls are freakin ' thin .
i can honesty say this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
from the moment we walked in the front door , i was terrified .
i was wrong .
even the restaurants within were terrible .
i did n't actually stay here , i 'm just reviewing the ambience .
huge disappointment .
do i need the voice of god telling me there is a fire alarm ?
i did not have fun .
rude employees & bad customer service !
anyway , we stayed at tower _num_ and the walls were thin .
you just wo n't feel welcome at all for being there .
i was disappointed that this place had pretty decent reviews after staying there .
after traveling for _num_ hours , this was not music to our ears .
my husband and i left vegas with lots of back pain !
their staff is incompetent .
housekeeping is so loud .
the whole hotel smelled awful .
all in all , we had a horrible trip .
the arcade smelled like mildew & made me want to gag .
smells terrible .
but you can get a room for $ _num_ sometimes !
me and my fiance stayed here while we were wedding venue hunting .
it was paper thin and did n't offer any warmth or comfort .
anything longer than a day or two and i would n't stay here .
they never cleaned the rest room from the last guest .
i am going to try to never have to stay here again.
the worse stay in vegas ever .
dumb move we left him in the room & went out on the town .
what a waste of time .
to get blankets we had to get approval again from the manager .
the place wasnt clean , the service was gross .
i dont think i ask for anything too much .
sadly , excalibur scores _num_ for _num_ on this measure .
lie to us and then stick us in a gross room .
stood in tower _num_ , needs to updated badly .
spent over $ _num_ a night on the room , not worth it .
it was n't worth it !
from the moment we walked in , we knew it was a mistake !
the place is just straight up trashy .
this place needs to be torn down .
felt this would be a better fit than the hard rock for them .
after check in we were stopped _num_ times by sales people .
we walked the strip and were stopped twice more on way in .
we wo n't be returning .
this is not a good hotel .
my bath towel smelled like smoke .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
the window shade had holes in it .
another had a cigarette burn in it .
only one bar of soap in the bathroom and the body wash was terrible .
loud neighbors and drunk people .
we were tired and trying to just get into our room .
i am not comparing this budget hotel to those .
this is not a good hotel .
spend the extra money and book at a cleaner hotel .
so gross .
overall , it was a nightmare and i left with a horrible headache .
it made chuck e cheese look like a luxurious spa destination .
many of the more popular games are $ _num_ or $ _num_ per person .
only three of the ticket counters were open .
_num_ tickets for a mini bottle of bubbles ?
sucks .
really run down .
unpleasant smell .
no bath tub .
cheap toiletries .
no decent restaurants .
the slot manager gets props for having some newer games , however .
also : vegas is not disney , folks .
our room was clean but we had a very ugly and limited view .
the big kicker about this place was the terrible and useless concierge desk .
rude or boring dealers and house keeping rushed us out .
everything in this hotel is run down .
we decided to grab a fast bite at the food court .
we stayed in the `` better tower '' which is number _num_ .
i could n't even imagine what one looks like .
unacceptable .
made me utterly sick .
needless to say , i changed my email .
the casino was ok , waitress was rude and never brought my drink .
so i booked this hotel for the same reason that most do .
as soon as i walked into the lobby the long lines shocked me .
i did not have a view so not much to note there .
it is what it is i guess .
there are plenty of options for grabbing a quick bite .
i do not recommend the buffet , but that was only me .
the service personnel in this hotel also had bad attitudes .
i understand thorough , but thorough can be done quickly .
so hopefully you find your things before you return home .
the arcade 's hours are the worst .
it closes too early and opens too late .
not sure if i would try this one again .
stayed here in october _num_ with my best friend for her birthday .
really , it should get _num_ 1/4 stars .
the bathroom had poor water pressure .
no fridge in the room .
the bed and furniture could be more comfortable .
outlets are an issue , and garbage cans are super small .
casino floor : _num_ stars .
though check in is a mile long , the casino floor is surprisingly empty .
overall , it was n't the worst i could have imagined .
what a creepy little shit hole .
lol it needs to be remodeled .
for those fees , there should be some actual amenities provided .
worst buffet and old building nothing else to say u probably got the point !
however the casino was nasty dirty .
there were parts disconnected and the filter needed to be changed .
and i could n't figure out how to shut it off !
some of them were rude about it .
i stayed here during the last week of june .
i think i stayed here _num_ years ago and everything looks just the same .
check in didnt take long , dude was ok .
it took forever to get our bags though .
the casino reeks of smoke .
my room was on floor _num_ , tower one .
not good .
fixtures and lamps and stuff were dirty .
towels were very thin and stained .
this is what happens to a casino when it is not kept up .
it 's pretty bad when the circus circus does a better job .
the casino is flat out dirty .
( it 's kind of like popcorn , smoke , and pee ) .
the staff is nothing to speak of .
it was cheap ?
just really really loudly ... .
besides that , this place sucks .
_num_ ) do they not clean their shot glasses ?
_num_ ) nasty pool .
cheap , feels dirty , and quality is just not there .
next time i think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere .
the bathroom could sure use a makeover , but was clean enough .
the casino is old , dark , dingy and not very lucky !
it was almost impossible to get a `` free '' drink .
the swimming pool was down right scary .
the restrooms in the pool area were absolutely disgusting .
parking was terrible !
( bc i felt it was taking too long !
_num_ ) yes , you can print your boarding passes .
that 'll be $ _num_ for ten minutes on the internet please .
_num_ ) room is ok .
my boyfriend and i spent three nights here last summer with no issues .
we wanted to take a nap after we checked in .
it was definitely not clean .
unfortunately , our stay did not end on a pleasant note .
my boyfriend and i were both very disappointed in our stay .
unfortunately , this stay was simply not up to par .
horrible !
but i guess you get what you pay for .
every other casino on the strip was booked .
thought this one would be decent ... wrong !
that 's the only reason i gave it one star .
rooms are totally outdated .
not even a clock radio .
no wifi .
stayed here _num_ times altogether .
mostly outdated .
please do not eat at the buffet .
worst food in history of las vegas buffet .
i upgraded to a suite & honestly it looked like a regular room .
this hotel smells ... ew i would never stay here .
i 'm so done staying here .
i 'm trying to relax .
do n't stay here !
reception desk people are less than friendly .
requested extra pillows , given a hard time .
not to our room .
very rundown hotel room .
no wi-fi either .
no room service ?
are you kidding me ?
we were put in tower one which is the worst .
avoid that tower at all cost !
everything looks dirty except the chapel , again the only highlight .
felt this would be a better fit than the hard rock for them .
after check in we were stopped _num_ times by sales people .
we walked the strip and were stopped twice more on way in .
we wo n't be returning .
i did not like this hotel at all .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
i 'm assuming they have the friday off for the labor day weekend .
no security camera on the hallways .
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
i 'm assuming they have the friday off for the labor day weekend .
no security camera on the hallways .
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .
the games are quite boring and not many selection .
other than that , the rooms are ok , but no fridge !
it 's cheap and all , but damn so far away from things !
but it 's not .
_num_ a night good deal through our event we did on sat .
the toilet ran the first night .
your clothes smell like it after _num_ mins in the hotel .
the only area that has wifi is the conference rooms .
this hotel is horrible .
so do n't upgrade .
it 's not worth it .
it gets very very old after a while .
they are aggressive and very rude .
i will never return just because of the show ticket sales people alone .
shame on excalibur hotel/casino .
it all came together , we were robbed in our own hotel room .
but someone out there stole my purse and my wallet in it .
her response was that my time starts _num_ minutes before my appointment .
i was there to relax , not be rushed by someone .
the amount of smoke was terrible .
only offered one show and that was the tournament of kings .
we will not stay here next time .
i talked to two different managers and nothing was ever done .
i would never stay there again .
the pool and spa closes at 6pm .
i was thinking of getting a shirt made up .
stayed in five hotels on out trip all around this price range .
this one was easily the worst .
oh , no wifi either .
i wish it was possible to give `` _num_ '' stars .
by far , the worst , most disgusting hotel i have ever stayed in .
stayed here for a `` cheap '' alternative while visiting for a bachelorette party .
did not even feel comfortable taking my shoes off in the room .
the sheets had holes and stains and the furniture was older than i am .
disgusting .
i will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either .
there is no wireless internet in the hotel .
my room did n't have an internet cable .
it had not been cleaned at all either .
thanks but free drinks are already provided when i gamble .
worst customer service ever .
never going back .
i just checked into the contemporary superior room and am definitely not impressed .
i do not recommend this room .
save your money and get one of the other rooms instead .
stayed here a few years ago and it was horrible .
if there was a zero star i would use it.
i 'll stay downtown where my business is appreciated .
the room itself was decent , nothing special .
p.s .
night time , it looks better , but then everything looks better at night .
the casino is big , but is dated .
the bad : this is not a hotel for couples .
my room was the standard king size room and was an okay room .
the mattress was worn out and needed to be replaced asap .
the ugly : the hotel is dated and needs a major facelift .
i hated paying the daily $ _num_ resort fee plus tax .
i cut them off and told them i was not interested in that garbage .
i will not be staying at this hotel ever again so bye bye excalibur .
we stayed for _num_ days .
as soon as the elevators opened , the smell was overwhelming .
it flat out sucks here .
casino is ok , everything is just out dated .
valet was n't the greatest .
the smell of smoke was everywhere .
you do n't see that very often .
there was no central ac .
no bath tub just shower .
but like the previous posts mentioned , felt like a motel _num_ set up .
no wifi in the room .
i called to request the connecting rooms and they were confirmed without a problem .
some negatives ... you can call ahead to request your car from valet .
prices were fair ( most games $ _num_ ) .
buffet was pretty bad ... see my review for it .
did not utilize fitness or spa .
pluses ... cheap prices on rooms .
resort fee is ridiculous ( $ _num_ ) , you get nothing for it .
no wifi .
so i ca n't really complain .
probably would not return .
i gave it one star because i could not give it a zero .
i am going to go after the door lock manufacturer and excalibur .
do not stay at here .
if you value your life do not stay here !
i will never stay here again _num_ main reasons .
cheap , old , dirty .
not sure how tower ii is .
probably not staying here again in the future .
horrible .
staying here because my friends are ... no !
i 'm in tower _num_ which is suppose to be the better tower .
i could 've paid a little more and stayed at a nicer place .
i 've stayed at excalibur quite a few times .
and my comforter had a cigarette burn on it .
rude bell hop that had a major attitude and was short with us .
then he stared at us and wondered why he did n't get a tip .
the pool with the slides the arcade with all those toys to win !
they really need to give this hotel a makeover .
i normally stay elsewhere .
contemporary means updated ( does n't it ? )
the problem is everything else .
i know , for $ _num_ .
this was a mistake .
gum stuck everywhere .
our room was no winner either .
its quite a shame .
everything is clearly reheated and none of that was even done well .
every thing we ate was cold in the middle .
even this was not cooked all the way .
i do n't believe he spoke english .
now for the biggest problem of all .
prepare to be approached by timeshare salesmen .
and even still , do n't buy it from here .
not a great location , rooms are small and guaranteed to smell bad .
as i said the rooms are small , the windows do n't really open .
excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square .
there 's just one thing going for excalibur - it 's cheap .
but you get what you pay for ... not much .
he said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine .
i have stayed there maybe 10-15 times .
i was disgusted to get into the shower even .
avoid playing slots at this hotel !
this place is nasty .
no way !
those people probably live in a barn .
i did n't want to take my shoes off .
there are no good restaurants here .
there is no wifi !
circus circus seems cleaner .
we should have rented palms place for $ _num_ a night .
the clientele in the casino were very creepy .
they looked like off duty renaissance fair workers .
rooms need a little tlc though .
wall paper was peeling and table had sticky stuff on it .
but i 'm also not thrilled with the excalibur .
so the rating can be explained either way .
when i travel for work , i travel cheap .
but no way would i skimp and book this place for a vacation .
does n't come on up into your space and leave a mess .
alas , there are so many more names i ca n't recall .
our room seems to be clean .
we did n't use room service so i do n't know about that .
our room was looking at a wall and trash exit of some restaurant .
and i got almost zero reception for my cell phone .
on top of that they charge hotel resort fee .
there is no wifi .
let me tell you `` just rip-off '' .
it is basically a money trap .
no kings !
i give this _num_ star just for the outside .
i could n't argue the price was great .
took us _num_ min to get someone to open it .
i felt gross knowing i stayed in that bed , used that hot tub .
have n't stayed here in a while and am reminded why .
this very smoky hotel seems old and outdated .
beds are comfy but it 's downhill from there .
not until our recent trip to vegas that we will never go back again .
i would give this hotel a zero if i could .
the room in tower i was very stuffy .
older hotel .
the receptionists at check-in were rude .
the buffet was awful , with price outrageous .
food cold , dry and no one attending the area .
do n't risk staying here no matter how good the deal is !
she told me the excalibur never checks anyone in before 3pm without the fee .
my fianc and i decided to check out bags and just walk around .
the doors for the rooms are around an inch off the floor .
the lady was very rude and tried to get me off the phone .
- no free wifi !
not a fan .
i tried the $ _num_ trick and it did not work !
so i said no thanks .
also , there is someone trying to sell you something every _num_ feet !
it became unbearable to simply walk in and out of the hotel !
what kind of a vegas hotel does n't have wifi in _num_ !
overall , just a bad experience .
excalibur hotel is a giant , cheap motel .
i have never stayed in any hotel / motel without a coffee maker !
what kinda cheap spit is that ?
the temperature of the room was either really hot or really cold .
the thermostat did n't do an actual , comfortable temperature .
the bathrooms are also only okay .
this place is cheap .
i tried to reach house keeping could not , waited forty minutes on hold .
would stay again , and hopefully get better service .
they said no and i left and went to caesars .
you ca n't just blame excalibur .
honestly , i would never pick excalibur to stay at .
the location is not ideal to me .
a few times we just parked at new york new york and walked over .
lame !
was n't really an upgrade , just a slightly larger room .
the ac worked but it was old and made a lot of noise .
some of our pillows were lumpy .
it was slow but still glad to have internet !
overall , this place could use a remodel .
i was not that impressed .
there was no wifi which was thoroughly disappointing .
the hotel itself is like a maze which i did n't enjoy .
i let it go thinking the smell would go away after a while .
they eventually gave me a new room and it was fine .
the rooms are all old but for the price i guess you cant complain .
what the hell is that .
i 've never been to a hotel that does n't serve past 2pm .
this place smells like shit and cigarettes !
i love mgm properties , but this place is garbage !
we were playing at a slot machine and got ignored by two cocktail waitresses .
forget this place and stay at the tropicana !
there are two hotel towers .
it is not like you are going to stay in the room that long .
also , i was somewhat annoyed that they charged an early check in fee .
you can not check into the hotel until 3pm .
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed !
the security guy said someone opened our door _num_ times use the key card !
and no one mentioned to compensate us !
pool : what a dump !
room : old , dirty , used up .
this was the first stop on a week long vacation .
we chose the excalibur because it was cheap .
we paid $ _num_ and $ _num_ was comped back to us .
we could n't have really asked for any more in that department .
leave me alone . '
the lack of wifi in the room was another huge turn off .
this year was a little different and we probably wo n't be back .
this place has really gone downhill since i last stayed here .
the safe in the room did not work .
the room looked dim and dingy .
it does not feel clean at all .
will not stay here again .
the resort fee is a joke .
you ca n't even pay for wi-fi in the rooms .
there is really nothing for them .
our first room was nasty .
clearly the room was not cleaned thoroughly , tv did not work .
my husband was ill and stayed behind .
it would n't shut ( again 25th floor ) .
called front desk , promised it would be fixed by noon .
got back around _num_ pm no one had fixed the window .
she refused to let him in .
i then realized the penny was the fix !
just thankful u did n't gave younger kids !
we stayed in tower _num_ which is supposedly the nicer of the two .
it really was fine , nothing bad or gross .
however , the furnishings are tired and worn .
i was there with another male friend and we are not sharing a bed .
dealers : be nice or you do n't get tips .
the arcade games are a bit pricy and the show is expensive .
have stayed at excalibur many times throughout the years .
called to resolve the problem .
finally after _num_ hours decided to deal with once in vegas .
the girl who helped us check in was very helpful .
refunded money , upgraded us , and gave us a late check out .
they do n't tell you online that there is a _num_ resort fee .
the rooms were very outdated .
our room also had a weird smell to it .
worst stay at a las vegas hotel so far .
the room is very basic .
the staff and dealers are rude .
i do n't know how this place is _num_ 1/2 stars .
it is extremely outdated .
thin walls .
bare minimum rooms .
could be worse , but we wo n't stay here again .
the rooms and bathrooms are badly outdated and dirty looking .
this place reminds me of a motel _num_ in a castle form .
this place is disgusting .
never again will i think of staying here again .
there are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom .
this place is the worst hotel in vegas .
i do not recommend anyone to stay here .
this place was such a disappointment on so many levels .
very very disappointing to say the least .
i will not be giving out recommendations for your company .
the stole my mother in laws purse and my daughters purse .
our room smelled like old moist !
the room showed online is not the room you 'll get .
from the minute you walk in it will be regret if you stay here .
on top of that the staff is horrible .
hands down has to be the worst hotel on the strip .
my first experience at the excalibur was not good not bad just okay .
as a vegas veteran , i know what to expect on the strip .
so i booked the room .
how annoying !
that is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .
we went to the wynn buffet one day and it was awesome .
for a nicer experience get a suite .
this has to be the worst hotel i have stayed at .
waste of money and will never stay their again .
i am a vegas veteran been there four times this year alone .
worst mistake ever !
the decor is old and ugly in the hallways and the rooms .
i would never stay there again even if it was free .
spend a little extra money and go stay somewhere better .
room are nice enough but has a few big fails in my book .
no wifi in the room is awful .
the resort fee is a total scam .
no resort here .
they clearly do not clean these rooms thoroughly .
i hated this place the whole time i was here .
secondly , the parking is awful .
service was alright , was n't rude and not a problem .
the first thing i noticed was the smell .
it is absolutely awful , it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must .
if you could book a non-smoking room there was n't a mention of it .
there was no wifi and there was n't a channel guide for the tv .
the tv also was not even close to hd .
the beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap .
this hotel also has the worst dining on the strip .
cheap , tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place .
this place is essentially the motel _num_ of the strip .
ok ... my issue is not the fact that they need to update .
my issue is bed bugs .
this is just dirty .
beds were comfy , but no coffee pot in room .
i 'm sorry , but , that 's bad customer service .
( we hated this hotel .
it was horrible .
very outdated and we booked a king room .
when we got to new rooms they were still disappointing .
the beds are hard and very uncomfortable .
the only positive thing about hotel was the food choices .
they had a variety and not all of them would break the bank .
as far as rooms go , i would never recommend excalibur .
the room is very dated .
no power outlets except for the one in the bathroom .
there is no safe and small fridge .
the pillows are nasty .
i tried second bed and it was better but not great .
no coffee machines in the room ?
beds sucked .
the most musty stale smell ever !
my first thing , check the bed for bugs or anything weird .
no bugs , but i did find hair ... and lots of it !
this hotel seriously needs an upgrade tho ... .
not to mention that the tv channels suck .
save some extra cash and go elsewhere .
as has been mentioned before , no wifi either .
but do n't play the slots there , you ca n't win !
honestly , i was asked that at least _num_ times in two days .
it was so bad that i had to find a different casino to gamble .
charges for room is misleading .
something like $ _num_ , so u think .
my previous day room charge was cheaper than my late check out .
this place is a disgrace .
the room had no coffee machine and no wifi .
to be fair , the latter is n't excalibur 's fault .
customer service at this hotel is absolutely horrible .
do n't waste your $ $ .
improving gambling and comps would make you more competitive .
room service did not clean our room till _num_ every day .
do not stay here .
sleep in bed , and stole the purse that was on the table .
after they investigate , they told me door was not locked ( what ?
old and ugly rooms .
my view looks like i 'm looking at a prison .
the room was so dirty that we couldnt breathe after sleeping .
they actually laugh at you when you lose money .
not too bad of a hike unless you 're stuck in _num_ degree heat .
a $ _num_ dollar room ?
overall : a very pedestrian experience .
we stayed at excalibur for _num_ days the week before christmas .
it was very dated and the wall paper was peeling .
did n't get any sleep .
i mean , really ?
went alone and will not be going back to this hotel .
staff friendly but they cant change the decor .
this ended up not being true , they did have a buffet .
this is a sorry excuse for a hotel .
nothing like spending your new years eve in a room infested with bed bugs !
gross .
i would never go back again .
would never ever return to stay .
the rooms are outdated and if you want an updated room it cost extra .
why not just update all the rooms ?
trashy .
very disappointed in the room .
big mistake .
on day _num_ when i left still broken .
the doors do not close all the way unless pushed or pulled .
even if i had a free night i would not stay there again .
i 'm sorry = i do n't care .
i understand = i do n't care .
finally we find parking .
rooms are not all that great .
beds are hard and there is no fridge or microwave .
first impression - the carpet and hallway were dirty and dingy .
looks like it has n't been upgraded in _num_ years .
the room was equally bad .
also , the parking is atrocious .
however , i wo n't be back .
parking sucks .
wo n't be going back there again .
i stayed in tower _num_ for _num_ days !
it smelled like weed the whole time !
also the annoying security asking for room keys everytime by the elevators !
let 's not forget the crappy food choices !
he did n't offer us a free room .
he just said that this was not his problem .
its was ok but not that great .
i paid for one of the remodeled rooms and it was a horrible experience .
security never smiles and it seems like everyone is drunk .
tram to and from excalibur , luxor , and mandalay bay .
the slots did n't pay out for us at all .
there are not enough waitresses .
the buffet left much to be desired at excalibur and luxor .
i went to las vegas for a small valentines getaway with my boyfriend .
we were lucky enough to get a complimentary room upgrade which was nice .
but do not assume that a guest is smoking drugs when they are n't .
my mistake .
false advertising and i was extremely disappointed .
entering the non smoking room , it smelled like smoke .
i immediately called guest services and requested a room change .
i would never step foot in this filthy casino again .
it 's not even worthy of a star .
i booked his hotel for my first visit to vegas .
the first night , the room was clean .
i waited a hour and no one showed up .
all they did was to offer me a refund on my resort taxes .
thanks for ruining my first trip u o vegas .
really bad theme for a gambling casino .
this is no man cave it 's a boy cave .
this hotel does n't deserve one star either .
i paid _num_ bucks through the app to buy the room .
it 's wednesday , and i have n't got anything from them .
i feel like i do n't have any power to fight back .
they are rude .
i knew i should have book at mgm again .
do n't think we will be staying here again .
ok , so check this out .
really disappointed in this place .
the problem started when we checked in .
i went back to registration and asked to move up even just one level .
the gentleman said he still did n't have any other rooms available .
we spent our time on our vacation trying to avoid the hotel room .
i was kinda iffy about staying here due to the cheap price .
i could not understand why dirty linens were folded and stocked on the cart .
they were unable to put sheets on our bed .
this hotel is cheap , so it brings in lower end customers .
this hotel is no place for a good family .
the pictures for this hotel were very misleading .
the bathrooms are disgusting .
he was so rude .
he rudely said ok and left me standing there .
next time , i 'd probably splurge a little more on a nicer hotel .
the huge pool was not open during our whole stay .
this was not explained to us and is a huge rip off .
i am not sure why they sent so much but there was no conditioner !
house keeping did not come once in _num_ days .
no new towels for _num_ days .
first room smelled like shit had to change rooms .
then housekeeping never came to clean the rooms .
this place is a disgusting joke .
`` terrible service and business , will never come back .
completely run down and stinks horribly .
wi-fi would n't stay connected anyway .
sad how this hotel is going downhill fast .
the guy at the front desk said i could check in at that point .
the beds are old and very uncomfortable .
he then offered to try and clean the shirt .
i way it could be cleaned .
he said ok sorry about that and that was it .
$ _num_ down the drain .
she said i would need to pay for more alcohol .
the room was clean but had the smell of a motel .
i 've stayed at the excalibur twice and the level of service is atrocious .
the staff is beyond surly and rude .
being kept waiting at tables for _num_ mins without service ?
there is construction being done at 7am and they were not aware .
never will i make that mistake again .
their signature restaurants are buca de beppo and dick 's last resort .
gross .
not even this lady could keep a straight face on the dick 's spot .
hmmm maybe excalibur is this way on purpose .
the linens really sucked .
the bathroom was extremely spacious and we were given plenty of towels .
it was around $ _num_ for a friday and saturday night .
nope nope nope .
spent one night there and could n't wait to get out .
it was a wednesday night that we stayed .
this is absolutely ridiculous !
not only that , they have horrible customer service !
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone !
not a good vibe , kinda prison feel .
garbage !
_num_ $ in savings but nothing 's worth getting .
when i got to hotel after driving all day there was no commercial parking .
even though my expectations were low i have to say that i am disappointed .
while we were a bit disappointed we understood .
hot room , not cleaned properly and just plain beat up .
looks like they parked another car too close .
no compensation or discounts , nothing .
only stay if everything else is booked .
a very sad mgm property .
was n't too impressed with the room though .
it is literally just a decent place to sleep and shower .
the room itself to me seemed a little dated .
after leaving i thought i could not come back to stay here unless free .
other reviews have stated that tower _num_ is more updated than tower _num_ .
for being a resort on the strip , i was pretty disappointed .
from the minute we walked into the resort , everything was pretty basic .
i was also extremely disappointed by the customer service .
every person made me feel like i was wasting their time .
proximity to the strip was n't bad .
but our room had roaches !
only gave _num_ stars because they sprayed our room and have a refund .
this place is shabby , thoroughly unimpressed .
not sure , but yuk .
cons : front desk staff hate their job .
the toilet runs all night .
tv does n't work 1/2 the time .
the blinds do n't keep the sun out .
they do n't even have a coffee maker .
our room got robbed in the middle of the night as we were sleeping .
management would n't lift a finger about the terrible situation .
horrible .
so nasty !
to think we were sleeping on that is disgusting !
management or house keeping or security never once checked up on us .
horrible establishment !
i dont recommend this place plus the service is horrible .
our room was not that great .
as for the `` baja fresh '' , was horrible .
iv never been treated so badly .
this was by no means fun !
not off to a great start .
we picked this one for our kids .
our room was dusty .
until then , i would not stay here again .
the pool area was just concrete & water , not much fun .
always seemed cheap feeling here .
i was not a fan of the dingy vibe just walking in here .
absolutely horrible and rude costumer service .
she was not helpful and sounded extremely cranky .
still no one .
no thank you .
if i could give no stars i would .
rude and not helpful at all .
when i checked out me total was _num_ .
i 'm never coming here again .
this was the last hotel stay during our national park tour before flying home .
it was cheap , in many ways .
the room was clean , just not kept up well .
could 've used a little tlc .
we also had a terrible view .
they are the worst here !
the buffet was terrible as well .
the only good part was the crepes made to order !
simply stay away from this hotel .
this is a budget friendly hotel .
i booked a room at the excalibur for my friends and me .
there are more updated rooms that were available but appears for a little more .
the one major perk of the excalibur is the location .
there is no coffee pot in your room and that sucks too .
whats the point if you cant use it anywhere in the casino .
even _num_ a night would have been fair to us but not $ _num_ .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
this would be that place .
i do n't know why anyone would feel comfortable staying here .
nasty game they play .
the basics in hotel amenities were not met .
there is a smell that i can not stand .
for $ _num_ more i could have stayed at a four star hotel .
worst hotel in las vegas .
the room smelled like cigarettes , the blow dryer burned .
soooo not coming back !
we stayed _num_ night in _num_ rooms in tower _num_ .
wallpaper was patch worked & falling off the walls .
the light in the lamp was falling out .
the shower ( no tub ) was dingy .
there was no fridge .
the toilet water was all over the wrap that i carry my baby in .
this is the 1st & last excalibur experience for us .
this is the second worst casino i have ever visited in my entire life .
the hotel reeks of smoke , unlike any other we visited .
the pool was freezing cold .
times have changed , but excalibur remains stuck in the middle ages .
we booked a room for _num_ nights at $ _num_ a night .
the hotel was easy to locate and parking was not much of a hassle .
our room was located in the 25th floor in tower _num_ .
are they just making the beds and not changing the sheets ?
i 'm will definitely not be spending my money here , ever again .
i 'm hard pressed to remember service as bad i experienced at this hotel .
i am so put out with this place .
customer service- horrible could not describe it .
cheap hotel do n't expect much .
room was clean , bathroom was fine .
would n't go there for dinner the wow factor just is n't there .
check in was terrible , super long slow line .
our room was robbed some time after 5pm yesterday .
filed a report .
in addition to this utter nonsense ?
horrible hotel .
horrible experience .
other receptionists call us down over to them .
very poor service .
extremely slow check in .
it reminded me of a greyhound bus terminal .
rooms are awful .
nasty looking bathroom with cracked counters .
the edges of the carpet were thick with dust .
overall our stay sucked !
no bacon at the buffet breakfast !
what the hell ?
could n't seem to ever get valet to park the darn car .
otherwise go elsewhere because this hotel sucks !
unfortunately , i really did n't like my stay .
dirty water does n't bother me so much as the smell .
it was big enough to fit _num_ girls comfortably .
the furniture and look of the rooms are very outdated .
i should n't even give this place a star !
hotel was fine but parking was horrible !
a stupid coupon book that did n't have much savings was what we received .
bed bugs !
tower _num_ .
was told i would be contacted by risk management but never heard a word .
i have left several messages but have not been called back .
will not stay here again .
never again though .
oh good lord , this place has n't changed in ages .
i went for breakfast and they were making omelette and crepes .
my biggest problem was the room .
i walked in and it looked no one had cleaned it .
also , the trash was n't taken out at all .
i was pretty disappointed .
i called housekeeping and they came and cleaned the room fairly quickly .
our first room in tower _num_ had missing wall plates for the outlets .
the excalibur has turned into a 3rd rate piece of crap property .
if you are looking for fast friendly efficient service , look elsewhere .
this is a piece of crap property .
it is not really cheap , but , they make it look that way .
for example , it would be approximately $ _num_ for _num_ breakfast buffets .
yikes , can anyone really eat $ _num_ worth of crappy food .
bad memory !
years ago , my toddler fell and split her bottom lip in the bath .
so very unhappy with what i am experiencing at this hotel at this moment .
here _num_ minutes and already had to call maintenance .
bad customer service .
if the machine is frozen then why would i want to spend anymore money .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
they made the situation like it was our fault .
to add insult to injury , it was the most expensive night of all .
rooms were old , smelled of smoke and wet carpet .
the smell was so bad i had to get a different room .
would you believe they moved someone into the mildew room later that night ?
this place is horrible .
did i say horrible ?
in case i did n't say it .
this place is horrible .
avoid this place like the plague .
bad customer service .
if the machine is frozen then why would i want to spend anymore money .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
they made the situation like it was our fault .
another suspicious thing occurred at this hotel .
when i came back at 8pm , our room was not cleaned .
we noticed that they took out the trash but did n't clean our room .
instead of apologizing to us , they questioned us .
the day before they cleaned our room , but not today .
horrible .
people working here ruined the mood .
i suggest spending your money elsewhere .
i emailed them about my horrible experience and no one replied .
huge disappointment .
stayed here for _num_ days .
first of all the tv in the room was n't even working .
second of all the air conditioning was way too loud .
the hotel refused to change my room without any sort of upgrades unfortunately .
the toilet ran all night ( very loud ) .
two trips to the front desk , and no results .
the towels were clean but the beds were horrible !
the food was decent , but the server was horrible .
now i ca n't wait to leave and find another hotel .
customer service _num_ stars .
i am very disappointed .
the casino smell so bad , the cigarette smoke was terrible .
there was no bed bugs and the bathroom was big .
to begin this hotel was relatively expensive compared to some places here in vegas .
when we got it we were disappointed .
the bedding was not comfortable , really nothing special about this place whatsoever .
having to go down to get the other ... kind of annoying .
since i 've always wanted to try out excalibur .
i guess that 's why excalibur is so cheap .
my friend and i recently went to vegas for _num_ days .
it probably took _num_ minutes to get to the desk .
the resort fee was $ _num_ ( including tax ) for _num_ days .
i have been in better , i have been in worse .
now it seems outdated .
there was no flair and no charm .
the only bright spot was buca di beppo .
i used to think the strip was the shit .
the mgm resorts company has squeezed its last nickel out of me .
refund some of the money i spent and maybe i will accept it .
it gets worse .
avoid this place at all costs .
the most disgusting hotel on the strip .
looks like it 's been there awhile .
yeah i do n't recommend staying here ever .
really that 's what i get told .
the casino was subpar and reeked of stale smoke .
it was not the worst but there is far better .
honestly , i had no choice .
this room was _num_ % better !
the initial experience at the lobby left a foul stench .
i hotel hopped several hotels and this was low on the list .
worst hotel ever !
the only thing it has going for it is location .
smelly and musty , the rooms are old and made my clothing smell .
the bathroom in the room was moldy and musty and needed a complete remodel .
the reason why i gave it another star was because of the customer service .
we did n't even sit down .
the problem remains is that the entire tower _num_ needs to be renovated .
it is the equivalent to a run down motel _num_ .
no other major casino on the strip left such a negative impression as excalibur .
cons : poor housekeeping .
there were peanuts and shells on the floor in the bedroom .
just a blanket with two sheets around it .
not up to my standards especially since i work in the industry .
this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed at on the strip .
we all know how vegas lines are !
i am never going to stay in this hotel ever again .
very disappointing , excalibur , very disappointing .
literally , 10+ an hour .
we were also very disappointed in the lack of security .
the food at the buffet was mediocre , but had a large selection .
the casino was n't anything to write home about .
in serious need of refreshing though ; it was quite dated .
the hotel room was what you 'd expect .
it practically sounded like the windows were open .
so we get up , open the hall door and here 's nothing .
rude .
if we could 've gotten a room elsewhere we would have .
my experience at excalibur was average at best .
as lame as you might expect .
bed is rock hard and the lights in the bathroom do n't work .
sucks .
everything that could go wrong with a room went wrong !
those beds are so hard it 's like sleeping on the ground !
i have n't stayed here since i was a child .
this place is a landmark of vegas but it needs some major improvements .
i am in a non smoking room but it still smells old and musty .
will never stay here nor recommend it unless you want a dirt cheap hotel .
they even have me comps for the buffet and comped my resort fee .
hotel hell should come to this place and help them .
i 've had a better sleep in holiday inn .
excalibur really has done a awful job making their guest feel safe and appreciated .
and was very helpful and knowledgeable with helping me understand `` the lines . ''
the room smelt funny , like moldy .
i will never come back to this place .
gross .
the pizza hut which is n't apart of hotel undercooked my pizza .
outdated .
relatively dull .
no coffee machine .
no microwave .
if you 're staying at a casino hotel , you should stay somewhere else .
keeps getting worse .
i .
we get into out room and it stinks from the start .
i am seriously so grossed out , i ca n't even fall asleep .
this is just unacceptable .
being ugly in decor is one thing .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
the lack of cleanliness is very evident in this hotel .
no excuses .
paying guests should have a place to park , no matter what .
however the staff itself was always friendly and courteous .
it 's a very disappointing hotel to stay at .
negative - wifi is awful !
food is awful .
check in line goes pretty quick but the actual process is slow .
when i come back to vegas i wo n't be coming back here again .
the view outside my room was all brick wall .
the room is straight up old , it has never been remodeled .
yeah , this place just does n't seem very clean to me .
the bed is really hard and uncomfortable .
also ... the ac units are crazy loud .
terrible experience !
the food here is really bad .
you know when it is bad when their dessert are not home made .
they have the nasty sushi but no wasabi available .
feel like the chef had no passion on what they are cooking .
for $ _num_ a person for dinner so not worth it .
go somewhere else if you want to spend $ _num_ .
the hotel lobby stinks .
no mini fridge .
that 's ridiculous and just wrong .
worst experience in vegas ever .
do not waste your money on this stupid hotel .
there was a light bulb missing in one of the lights .
the tv was broken and would n't turn on .
the walls are paper thin , this place smells like heavy smoke !
gross gross gross .
it 's all complete crap !
i will never step foot there again .
this hotel is very outdated .
there was no fire but that alarm is loud as all heck .
the hotel itself is n't too bad .
make sure you know there is $ _num_ resort fees per day !
if you want excitement , take $ _num_ and go to las vegas .
would not recommend !
then when we got to the room we had little hairs on our towel .
so we requested more and when it came , it smelt like smoke .
yes , lori i will keep following up until .
all i was offered by the hotel staff was _num_ small ice packs .
wan na take a nice shower ?
no , you do n't need one .
they should have paid me to stay here .
i stayed the royal tower rooms which are not nice .
very sparse on any room amenities however the bed was good .
it just seemed old and stale and dirty .
room smells , ugly view , for _num_ for two nights ?
the worst hotel ive ever stayed in .
no reply .
this hotel does n't offer anything for a business traveler ... go elsewhere !
the hotel as a whole is dated .
this could be lived with if the units were not so loud .
that would have been nice to know at booking .
checked in valentines to get married the next morning .
desk staff was awesome and helpful .
the wait was _num_ minutes which was fine .
probably understaffed for the night .
_num_ min later still no server .
my brother got impatient so we left .
restaurant was clean and i saw the bus boys cleaning .
food is a _num_ if i could rate it .
maybe next time we visit we 'll try again !
this has been the worst stay of any hotel we 've stayed at .
the view she went on and on about , was not so great .
the hotel itself was mediocre .
it was the worst mistake ever ... .
but then i also noticed that they opened my car hood ?
but in reality , i know there will be no outcome from this .
totally not cool .
if i 'd known the real price , i would have stayed somewhere else .
i ca n't believe it .
i ca n't stop crying .
best i can say is disappointing overall .
rooms in the resort tower are dated , at best .
the air conditioner cover was busted off .
the beds were hard as rocks !
the bathrooms were decent but i 've seen nicer showers at motel _num_ .
i personally would not stay here again .
the decor has n't changed in years .
the security is inept .
no i do n't want to see carrot top !
really disappointing .
i did n't sleep the whole time i was there .
cons : no room in the entire hotel has a bathtub .
pros : beds were comfortable and cheap .
eight days in this place was more than i will ever do again .
apparently , management has decided that is not an option .
i was afraid to see the lower priced , `` old '' rooms .
the restaurants are , at best , also mediocre and very expensive .
i 'm still trying to figure out what the hell that covered .
the excalibur certainly was not that place .
my husband and i were asked _num_ times in one day before _num_ am .
it was ridiculous .
i will bet staying elsewhere next time .
overall , i 'm not impressed with the rooms here .
i received a room with _num_ double beds in a non smoking room .
with that being said ... the whole casino smelled like smoke .
really , they need to upgrade their rooms with 21st century amenities .
the bathroom also was kept up the entire time i was there .
usually , the rates are cheaper if you stay on weekdays .
weekend stays are rather more expensive .
but sadly , i will not stay in the hotel here again .
i have more to say but i just do n't feel like it .
they overcharged me _num_ times ridiculous !
i stayed there this past friday night i was in a room _num_ .
this place is terrible .
terrible rooms and facilities .
the resort charge does n't get you anything either .
from october _num_ to _num_ , _num_ , i stayed at excalibur .
i get this happens and we get into our room .
now , again , i understand this , as frustrating as it was .
as a result , i 've booked to stay elsewhere .
the hotel itself is old and not clean .
we went into our room and it was dark and it smelled really bad .
the cheap prices are not worth it .
we go to vegas almost each summer and we are booked elsewhere this year .
there is n't much to offer here anyhow .
no fridge .
smelled like smoke when no smoking room .
rude at the front desk check in and check out .
pretty much an overpriced .
motel six without the amenities .
$ _num_ a night with resort fee .
nothing in room a stained old chair desk beds and tv .
bedding very low end .
find another place just off strip .
just weak on all levels .
i wish i had read the other reviews before booking .
i gave this hotel _num_ stars .
like the hotel is trying to make it smell better .
i would just work on the smell it smells really bad .
the room however did n't smell like the rest of the place .
she also gave no direction on how to get to the room .
well no fridge and to get one you pay _num_ per night with tax .
this is quickly turning into a trip into hell .
very disappointed very annoyed very frustrated .
still in hell .
came back to the room to rest , and the tv does not work .
the room was dirty and obviously somebody had been smoking in the room .
the carpet is dirty and worn out the fixtures are also old and worn .
disappointed all around .
our room was basic , which was to be expected .
i was n't expecting mgm style .
but it was n't even properly cleaned !
gross .
and there was no fridge .
their customer service is horrible !
no mention of this when i booked slow service if any at all .
nothing in the room is updated , and there is poop on our window !
when i walked in , a weird smell came from the bathroom .
the tub was very cozy !
_num_ dollars extra .
( not sure if it 's per night ) .
there is no coffee maker !
gross !
i went to use the outlet to charge my phone .
i also went to use the iron .
that did n't turn on .
i was gone all _num_ days just about .
he looked at me like i was lying .
i wo n't stay there again .
oh and do n't forget ... bring your own coffee maker !
horrible .
so disappointed !
long walk from the elevator to the room .
rooms have no mini fridge , microwave , or coffee pot which is inconvenient .
the room was mediocre .
i wo n't be making this my go to cheap hotel ever again .
oh & mind you , none of the management cares .
clearly that is not work .
thanks but no thanks .
i wore flip flops at all times .
seriously , get rid of these clowns !
casino and room hallway smell .
it does n't smell weird , either .
extremely disappointed in this hotel at every turn .
horribly unimpressive rooms .
embarrassing for las vegas .
my in laws room was the worst !
definitely not a way to end your trip .
not enough parking , no parking for guests .
right next door .
we also had $ _num_ worth of clothing removed from our room .
this time however , i was severely disappointed .
now i get home check my receipt and nothing was refunded .
it 's so frustrating !
warning , i am going to write a book .
on tuesday i called the security again around 10am but no answer .
i did n't even get an apology which is so crazy .
i stayed at the excalibur in november _num_ - not a great experience .
not impressed considering i 'm staying in a castle ... !
no thanks !
also , picked up _num_ plastic cups from the bottom of the pool .
disappointed to say the least and i had low expectations going into this place .
so i paid like $ _num_ more .
when we get up there was n't as clean as it should of been .
the blow dryer did not work .
the toilet wouldnt flush .
she said she would have a manager call me .
i stayed on saturday june 4th .
still no one realized they had double booked the room .
i called the front desk again , they assured they had called security .
they sent me to new york new york .
plenty of apologies , but none were apologies for using pathetic unsafe practices .
and as for the arcade a lot of the games were not working .
i will not be coming back here .
there are too many other hotels to choose from .
the casino has an old appearance , decor .
not so happy with my _num_ night stay .
i really did n't enjoy our stay at the excalibur .
if i could give it a zero i would .
it was disgusting .
so the hotel was not bad .
the bed was ok for me , but uncomfortable for my wife .
the whole experience was awful !
worst service ever here !
worst vegas trip of my life !
i 'm extremely disappointed .
makes no sense .
no mention of this when i booked slow service if any at all .
i am beyond frustrated .
we walked here and there just everywhere with our luggage with horrible customer service .
no wonder it has only _num_ starts not surprised .
its ridiculous to pay for parking and then for there to be none .
wtf is a hotel fee for !
there is n't enough to parking !
more then to deal with all this crap !
my husband and i stayed here over the forth of july weekend .
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew .
our room was _num_ % clean .
not too bad but what i did see dirty was gross .
the parking facilities are atrocious .
be cautious and remember you get what you pay for !
worst experience of my life !
i filed a complaint and nothing has been taken care of .
all of these items were brand new .
we are all lucky that nothing worse happened to us during our stay .
this experience has been terrible .
this is basically the same response i received .
when we arrived at our room , someone else was inside already .
this spot is a joke .
horrible !
no coffee maker , not even glasses so we could drink .
i wish i could give it zero stars !
what a disappointment for our girls ' getaway weekend !
front desk , are you asleep ?
the only upside is there are $ _num_ tables .
i wish i could give a better review .
will not recommend .
unless you are on a very low budget and every other hotel is booked .
long long check in lines .
pool closes before _num_ pm .
room service too .
( no room service after _num_ for a family friendly hotel ? )
been to vegas so many times and never really stayed at this place .
ca n't believe they are charging parking now .
the hotel is old and stinks .
i think circus circus is better than this place .
zero stars !
what a terrible place .
i think the hotel staff should put an application in to work there .
the checkin was about _num_ people -- it was insane !
did n't think much about it since we were n't staying there .
i was wrong !
parking is not included in the $ _num_ resort fee !
its $ _num_ per night !
of $ _num_ per day , during the week .
the reviews on the buffet ( included in our reservations ) were horrible !
the reviews on the service at the pool were horrible .
infused water available at _num_ different locations , comfy towels .
do n't settle just to be on the strip .
what a horrible experience !
we have been waiting for _num_ hours for the checking line to get shorter !
unbelievable .
waste of time !
vacation time is precious and excalibur does not get out !
they were thin and worn out !
no coffee in the room .
was too tired to enjoy vegas that night .
i ca n't say i enjoyed myself here .
we just stayed _num_ nights at this hotel .
when we got to our room _num_ lamps did n't work .
i tried to call , but the phone rang and rang .
the air conditioning was cold and consistent .
the furniture in the room was old and worn down .
but i 've been in worse hotels .
a lot of food items were dried out like the potatoes .
the scrambled eggs were watery .
the french toast and pancakes were hard .
i felt gross .
the pool was so gross and it 's freezing cold as well .
you will be treated much better a few doors down !
good thing about it is that it is open _num_ hours .
i did find some batteries here as my camera ran out of power .
though no sunscreen .
drink and $ _num_ a beer .
customer service training is in order .
did i mention that this was after work and i was in my uniform ?
now i 'm at home , in pain with no meds .
my jaw hurts .
my pain relief meds , etc .
i only gave this locations stars because i had to .
they have the worst customer service i have ever seen .
no one else was using the self service however .
i 've never dealt with such rude employees .
just save yourself the headache and go to the walgreens across the street .
this is by far the worst serves ever !
just the worst ever .
a tired convention center in need of a tear down and remake .
the worst was the food court .
in this case , `` food '' however is a stretch .
the choices there overpriced and disgusting .
also the traffic can be a nightmare with a big convention .
lame .
that 's so frustrating .
and plus , it 's just bad for business .
so ladies , just leave the heels at home .
parking is ridiculous .
i do n't think it is in the best part of town .
do pairs , go in groups , just do n't walk by yourself .
but that has already been said .
the food is mediocre at best .
also , waiting in line _num_ minutes for a cup of coffee seems excessive .
i mean seriously , this is a convention center .
figure out how to get them the basics quickly .
they will check your bags for you for $ _num_ per bag .
food is too expensive .
its ok .
for a convention center , i 've had better , much better .
seriously , that bad .
no veggie anything at the grill and fox on every tv .
that is not easy here .
never seen such a horribly designed parking structure at a convention center .
then , they hire a bunch of security guards to guide traffic .
these people are rude and no professional .
the place does have a starbucks and a american express open lounge .
ridiculous .
the bathrooms are disgusting with piss everywhere and the whole place is just filthy .
audio staff is awful .
has to be one of the worst place for a trade show .
no place to sit to eat .
bathrooms get overcrowded and filthy inside like a college football game .
i do n't understand how the food owners continue to have this account .
get some better food in there , it 's _num_ not _num_ .
i was starving and had to get something else to eat .
they could use an extensive upgrade .
food service is not acceptable .
short staff , long lines , and multiple outlets .
trash cans not empty often enough .
this is my 3rd visit .
it was appalling !
this place sucks and it 's unfortunate when guests have no choice really .
nothing like taking the long way around when it 's _num_ outside .
love the con ... hate the venue .
first off this rating is based on the horrible food service scene here .
again bad food service management .
they could use an extensive upgrade .
for vegas , it is surprisingly dated convention center .
too bad though cause dr .
wait times are incredibly long .
i had a jambalaya and it was just awful .
not good at all .
it was a disaster from the beginning .
the waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink .
the salmon she ordered was n't fully cooked !
for some reason my manager gave ya 'll a _num_ % discount !
just another example of why drugs are bad for you kids .
just a hit or miss place for food and service .
they serve lots of beers and mixed drinks and have outdoor seating .
just want to qualify my review before i get into it .
i spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly .
the restaurant was n't very crowded at all for a friday evening at 7pm .
anyway , service was okay .
also the water served did n't taste that good .
food was just not that good .
but food really was a major let down .
the chicken wings were way too sweet .
the quality and presentation of the food is bad .
but , my recent experiences have been disappointing .
we were told that was the only available table ... but it was n't .
all in all , i see no reason to give them a 5th chance .
* no reservations at bar .
not even for large groups !
* happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area .
it 's a disappointment that the service was subpar .
the waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering .
it was not crowded .
only about _num_ customers .
i 'd say the two hostesses were quite rude if you ask me .
so maybe the _num_ out of _num_ of us , actually order food .
just regular plain tomato juice .
but _num_ minutes later , we get the tomato juice ?
so here 's where i absolutely could not stand the rest of our experience .
and thankfully that 's all we gave our server for the experience .
so another friend ordered a side of fruit , which we never got .
thanks , but no thanks .
consistency in food preparation does not exist between locations .
the chicken wings dry ( lacking glaze ) and over cooked .
but no worries .
when i had eaten all i could , there was still alot left over .
otherwise , a decent night can become an embarrassing nightmare .
according to my friend , steak tacos were meh .
flatbread had no flavor .
too bad that this place was n't that great .
sucks for him .
and then tell your waitress it 's nevada state law .
i 'm not a tourist .
such a waste .
it was n't even my order .
other than that , the food was meh .
not as good as i remembered .
i just ca n't quite get past the kobe burger thing .
`` sorry , are we bothering you ? ''
the turkey burger looked , tasted , and felt like leftover meatloaf .
not leftover from last night , but maybe last week .
i think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread .
or hell , just walk across the street to firefly for actual tasty food !
portions and quality went down quite a bit .
i have to assume they are trying to cut costs and it shows .
everything seems to be a little more bland .
maybe there 's a food shortage in vegas .
potatoes and cabbage out of season , perhaps .
anyway , fish was ok.
overcooked and dry .
i 'm sure she had better things to do ... not a bad experience .
but would n't go back .
i 've cooked better stir fry at home .
worst service i 've ever had .
rude , disrespectful , and way too much attitude .
our server would n't take our order without rolling her eyes .
slammed our waters down on the table .
gave sassy one word answers to questions and refused to be helpful .
we left after _num_ minutes .
friendly service but the wait for the food is out of this world .
once the right dish actually arrived only lack luster can describe the food .
i am not impressed with this restaurant .
the ribeye was less than great quality .
too thick and not much flavor , other than the gorgonzola on top .
the ahi tuna salad was very blend .
the rating is solely based on experience with the general manager - mike wong .
such a disappointment .
well i was wrong to pick this place .
server was alright not that she was great but she was n't bad .
we ordered _num_ burgers : _num_ cali 's and _num_ veg .
horrible turnover from one server to the next .
are the empty beer and water glasses not enough of a clue ?
not sure i care to give this place another try in the near future .
the food was delicious , however the service was horrible .
unfortunately , all good things apparently must come to an end .
we have visited less and less because of it .
tonight may be the last night we ever go there .
the food was terrible .
they were tasteless and smelled like old beef .
the brats were tasteless .
even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting .
it was abysmal in every possible way .
they have lost good customers tonight .
no more .
the two stars are based on the food only , which was amazing .
the garlic fries were to die for !
the bartender seemed annoyed even though the bar was full .
the mahi we ordered was okay but so dry it was inedible .
the lobster mac was bland but okay !
why are they so salty ?
is lettuce not in season ?
i went here for dinner last night because i was craving a margherita pizza .
not spending my money at a place like that .
i have no desire to ever have it again .
did not eat and would not make a special trip for happy hour again .
the service started out like crap and picked up toward the end .
it was like _num_ bucks so i had high expectations .
my burger was ordered medium and came out well done and not hot .
in fact none of our food was hot !
the asparagus was cooked well with a good char but no spice at all .
and again came out barely warm .
it was a little bitter for my taste .
it was rather dry considering it 's price .
chips were crisp , fish was battered and crisp without being oily .
the portion size was large ( she was unable to finish ) .
there was plenty of blue cheese dressing .
the kitchen was very slow , the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing .
the total with tax was $ _num_ .
truly disappointing experience .
waitress never came back by to check on us .
happy hour prices are ridiculous .
till then , it 's for drinks only , if even that .
first off they changed the menu but not for the better .
it was ridiculous .
while waiting for rest of party , _num_ of us sat in the bar .
worst service possible .
they did n't want to serve us and made it very clear .
our server was hostile .
the seating areas are for customers . ''
a large group of us decided to go out here tonight .
all sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor .
however today my burger was more like a slider .
that moment was _num_ minutes later .
she only had _num_ tables so not quite sure why that took so long .
_num_ minutes later i got my coke .
not good , not bad .
over the past year the food has really gone downhill .
service was friendly but so-so .
wo n't be back .
anyway ... . )
wo n't be going back , which is a shame .
the beer and sausage sliders were yummy though !
the steak was burnt and the mushrooms for the side tasted canned .
after ordering brownie with ice cream i gave up .
next time , i do n't think there will be one .
the food alone is maybe a _num_ star .
definitely a disappointing meal .
service was not very good .
the waitress was n't super friendly and their food runner was extremely rude .
well , after the terrible service the beer just did n't taste very good .
just got the worst customer service ever !
they were rude and completely horrible .
avoid this place at all cost !
bad service .
we walk in and they take _num_ minutes for a server to show up .
this meant sending the food back and waiting for it to be cooked again .
our servers name was josh , and he was terrible .
brought a party of _num_ people there last night .
you ca n't really mess up a salad so those were fine ... .
i hate writing crappy reviews .
i know some people relish it , i do n't .
businesses are trying hard .
owners , staff and managers are trying hard .
literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading .
zero stars .
flat bread pizza .
just a complete miss .
it was tiny and completely lacking any touch .
zero stars .
the management agreed it was disgusting and yet did nothing about it .
this place said no to separate checks , so many of our group left .
could have been a bit better in price .
i know now why the other _num_ locations are permanently closed .
service was good enough .
ribs was not part of it .
of course , hours go by and we 've just completely missed the boat .
the stuff looked like it 'd been sitting there forever .
our slices were n't all that great either .
no , i 'll never have pizza here again .
gross !
i know places have bugs that us customers never see .
so would n't i just be able to build a margherita pizza ?
man people are idiots .
not really .
$ _num_ dollar , hour and a half long delivery time pizza .
burnt and cold .
certainly not with all that grease .
the sauce was ok , and the ingredients were flat .
extremely rude staff member .
way too many options to tolerate this treatment .
this is the worse pizza i 've ever eaten .
i 'm from chicago and we use real cheese !
no one was there !
it seems to stop there though .
got same reception when we checked out on monday .
free wi-fi advertised but very weak signal - constantly lost contact .
this place is really gross .
old tv that i could not make work .
the linens appeared clean and the towels were abundant .
upon arrival to my room the bathroom did n't have any bath towels .
the shower head sprayed all over the ceiling and walls .
this was a holiday weekend and this place was empty .
i checked out of this filthy place _num_ hrs later and will never return .
very upsetting ... .
all delivered from an uncaring staff .
i do n't know why so many insurance companies have her as a provider .
we then waited an additional _num_ minutes past the original appointment time .
at this point my daughter was extremely upset and crying .
worst experience ever coming to this doctor .
i have never been so disrespected in my entire life .
just an assistant of some kind .
are you kidding me ?
`` she can pay with a check why would you tell her that ? ''
do n't waist your time with this office , find a different one .
this is pretty boring .
i 'd rather go watch the bellagio fountains again .
skip this expensive place .
it is hit or miss .
plus they are so limited .
it 's dark , you ca n't see anything .
at first , i was extremely excited to go to this wax museum .
there were a few who were very far off .
not even close .
a thing i did n't like too much was the size .
if you have , i think you can pass on this one .
luckily i had my student id and paid $ _num_ .
the only good part of this location as opposed to the london location ?
the scary part was entirely closed .
hmm , that 's weird .
he kinda listens , but is really looking at my tickets .
i 'm so sad she 's not here . ''
`` i do n't live here , i live in seattle . ''
silly , i know , but i felt really bad .
because to me , $ _num_ is a lot of money for nothing .
so got the money back , but what a lot of trouble .
and disappointment .
unfortunately , my experience was this .
on the whole , this place is just meh .
way overpriced and not enough wax figures to see .
very disappointed and would never go back .
kinda pricey at _num_ a head to look at some wax statues .
no one has returned our multiple calls and emails .
this is so beyond acceptable , i am at a loss .
warning : to all future vegas tourists , this is overpriced .
also it 's $ _num_ for a bottle of water .
i thought it was overpriced and a waste of time .
i was disappointed that there were n't more wax figures .
we paid $ _num_ with a _num_ % discount .
not worth the trip .
there were not many figures , and was not worth the money .
this was not worth the money .
the figures were life like , but this is no museum .
very disappointing .
some of the figures were so life like it was creepy .
this place is the absolute worst .
this is the worst for a disabled person to have to go through .
complete waste of my money .
no good celebrities .
i was n't tempted to take pictures with anyone .
extremely disappointing .
pretty bad experience .
the exhibit is probably fine , i would n't know .
caused my children to be upset and almost ruined our vegas family vacation .
oh god , i pity him now .
the kitchen could n't even spare a second to check if it was done ?
i could 've eaten that thing with a spoon !
this is n't going to be a positive post .
that day it was n't so bad .
i ate it and left .
horrible service .
it then took another _num_ or _num_ minutes before we got our drinks .
i eventually canceled my order because everybody was almost done with their food already .
i used to love going to that one with my mom as a child .
what really put me off about this place is the service .
that cost $ _num_ extra , each plate .
not worth discussing .
i 'd suggest going somewhere else , though .
apparently you folks are not so consistent from location to location .
first off , who puts pink roses on a ninja turtle cake ?
that 's just bad planning right there .
secondly , the cake was terribly bland .
them people that works there do n't know how to greet customers properly .
i do n't recommend going to this place at all .
yuck , after my first experience here i will never come back .
it 's overpriced & not really authentic to begin with .
how hard is it to wash your vegetables !
food was alright , not the best .
wo n't be back .
waitresses are horrible !
change your service or get the heck out of hospitality business !
most bullshit business ever !
stay far away from this place !
at this time , we already lost our appetite .
this is a shame for an established food chain !
how many customers like us have been treated this way .
customer service was terrible !
not a fan of this particular location .
sent it back and came back less salty .
assuming water was added because it was not that hot .
no meat and disappointing .
only coming here for the bakery in the future .
much better filipino food elsewhere and not overpriced as this place .
the food was average , nothing over the top .
it was however , very greasy .
almost yellow in color , smells nasty and the meat is just little bit .
i wish employees would be more friendly and open to the guests .
waste of money and overrated !
i am pissed .
horrible customer service .
i am so insulted .
plus they still had plenty of breakfast food left .
terrible .
so you wo n't be getting these crappy reviews .
the service just sucks .
change it & you might just drive better business .
man , what a very rude old lady .
but our other coworker did not .
but , i like the ones from crown bakery in chinatown much better .
they never fail me !
portions sucks .
service was n't so great either !
poor customer service .
i normally tip even for just picking up food from a restaurant but this time.
i was so angry that i did n't bother .
it was extremely small and parts of it were over cooked .
it was also extremely salty .
every filipino restaurant in new york gives a free order of rice per person .
they charge when additional rice is ordered .
i walked in with very specific requirements for new work shoes .
i should have talked to a manager .
the worst customer service ever .
but it is not a option .
not paying for something that i did not receive .
i will update this review if i ever get an appointment .
their front office staff is apparently really bad and has no customer focus .
she allowed the appointment to stand .
next , i leave the office .
and then they made me sit for an hour .
horrible experience !
the sales people and owner are not honest .
but that is not the biggest problem .
my request was ignored .
i was disappointed .
my repeated request for this information was ignored .
this is not a trustworthy or honest business .
they made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience .
if the manager is reading this , all those bitches should be fired .
lady asked me where my cup is .
whoa she gave me very bad look like i am stupid .
that information was obviously wrong .
i have never seen worse customer service .
called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed .
they were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me .
horrible is an understatement !
well it was no where in sight .
wishing _num_ minutes it disappeared and was turned off .
my find your phone service showed the phone was turned off in that store .
horrible service .
first , the place is butt ugly .
tacky paintings .
bad lighting .
service was slow but i 'm thinking maybe it 's relaxing and not slow .
i ask the waiter and he says the a/c has failed .
at best , everyone 's dish was mediocre .
mine was overly salty .
the manager says , `` well , have you already eaten ?
one of the all time worst meals i 've ever had .
if i could give it negative stars , i would .
if you want great italian at a better price , go to pasta mia .
all i can say is very very disappointed !
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
the side dishes arrived at the table for my guests and myself cold .
no one came to the table to check on us and follow-up .
i ordered osso bucco so did _num_ of the other _num_ people .
when it finally arrived it was tender but with very little taste .
very bland !
( waiter tuxedo restaurant ) .
i 'm not .
_num_ star dump .
a table of _num_ , entrees all around , two bottles of wine .
the service however was very poor .
we recently had dinner here as a party of _num_ .
first off this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift .
it 's decor is not only very dated but a bit shabby .
second the service is slow .
after that long of a wait i was n't sending it back .
it was overall cooked perfectly but very bland .
lastly the restaurant was noisy .
noisy to the point of nearly ruining our dining experience .
salads were bland and tasteless .
a lot of reviews talked about spinach raviolis in cream sauce .
it was the highlight of our meal ( as was the creamed corn ) .
the veal shank ( osso bucco ) was fork tender but bland .
honestly , there has to be better italian food or vegas is in trouble .
considering the prices i would never return to this establishment for any reason .
huge disappointment .
this was incredibly annoying .
vegas is n't exactly lacking expensive high quality restaurants .
strike _num_ !
after the specials were presented _num_ entrees were selected .
all come with their house salad and potatoes & vegetables .
the sides were ice cold a mashed potatoes & grilled carrot & greens .
both sides of pasta were poor simple as that .
will i go back , maybe if someone else buys .
that was my fault but i hate to break the flow of a meal .
the least expensive bottle of wine was the house wine at $ _num_ .
our bill came to $ _num_ without the _num_ % tip that we include .
this will not fly with locals .
it is a shame but we will never return .
i 'll pay top dollar for food- if it 's worth it .
truly disappointing that this place has turned into a joke .
i was so excited to try this las vegas landmark .
i finally went and was disappointed beyond belief .
the service was rushed , the food was bland and expensive .
totally not worth the price of admission .
mark our waiter was the worst i have ever had in vegas .
it 's a shame that the bus boy had to do all the work .
he was much better than the waiter .
last night something went horribly wrong .
avoid !
good food but bad service .
i went with a party of _num_ , so tip was automatically included .
it took another _num_ minutes for me to find someone to pay the bill .
some lady runs up to me screaming i cant park here .
im not a limo stupid lady .
i left never to go back .
so bad , that i had to post this .
the bartender just placed _num_ different open bottles on the bar to look at .
dinner came and my veal bolognese was horrible .
lacked flavor and was just plain bad , especially for $ _num_ .
_num_ star ?
$ _num_ dollars i wish had back .
looking for italian in las vegas , look elsewhere .
i am hoping they management reads this and takes appropriate actions .
i could bare my hear the waiter or the other guests at my table .
the veal was overcooked and drowned in sauce .
and prices are not too bad for vegas .
but with all the great restaurants in vegas there are better options .
out of the four dinners , not one of us was satisfied .
waitress was fair , will not return .
i ate here this week and brought very good clients .
the food is extremely over priced and it was not just bad but horrible .
the salmon entre was over _num_ dollars and it was dry and tasteless .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
just terrible .
entree 's came out during salads , waters were empty and staff was absent .
i 'm the manager here and i need this table . ''
there are two empty tables next to us .
worst service ever .
party of _num_ , over _num_ hours .
the food was decent , i just could n't stand the service .
zero stars , dont even go there .
the food sucks too , no taste , yuck to bland food !
we left somewhat disappointed .
food was bland and service was not the greatest .
not sure we will go back .
this is not a gluten free friendly place .
they do n't know what to do if you have a gluten allergy .
it was a stunning disappointment .
i am a huge osso bucco fan and this was below average .
to cap it off we could n't get a cab for about _num_ minutes .
valet : cordial , but did not look clean .
do not eat the food off the grill here .
good cheap beer and slot machines but stay away from the hot dogs .
you really do n't want to stop here .
this place is dirty and the employees are rude .
ok -- - fat tuesday = not a bar .
`` yea and can i get one for my girlfriend too ?
the line is annoying to pass on the way to real bars .
didnt even care to wipe it down .
the whole enterprise is an embarrassment to good taste .
i was disappointed .
really are you kidding me ?
only thing i have to say is i come from south florida .
thus , no business for them .
it was n't as good as i expected .
you also do n't benefit from generous bartenders like you would at evening call .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
are you effing kidding me ?
this is completely unacceptable .
sugar content : extremely high .
alcohol content : extremely low .
price : you 're paying a lot for a bunch of sugar .
doughy and bland .
my travel companions were equally disappointed .
if you go here , do n't expect anything special .
it 's not authentic , and it does not have a great menu offering .
the food they do offer is very bland , and simply below average .
each time i went there , i took advantage of the tuesday special .
she then drives _num_ minutes back home .
i left , never to return .
she could have saved me an hour trip .
i went here after reading all the yelp reviews .
i do n't understand all the rave reviews .
it was all overcooked and brown .
the omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes .
the bagel : nothing special at all .
it was not extra tasty or extra large .
not this time .
these diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way .
it was just weird .
that i found it that the cheese was $ _num_ .
with tax my total bill was $ _num_ not counting a tip .
so yes , you could very easily get your entre $ _num_ cheaper .
it 's in a real crappy part of town .
my husband , visited the store earlier this morning to get our family breakfast .
the food , when i finally ate it was n't that good .
terrible service .
this place is run terribly avoid at all costs !
now it is the most bland disgusting watered down garbage ever .
i have not been here since and do not plan on going back .
however this time the soup tasted like a bowl of water .
i would never go back again .
bagels was n't the best i 've had .
we arrived at 12:30 noon to an absolutely empty restaurant .
anyway , i 'll get to the point .
the food is okay but expensive for vegas .
the real problem is the restaurant itself .
the back near the restroom has narrow hallways , is darker and feels dirty .
he had no idea how to blow dry curly hair .
worst place ever !
customer service is pretty much non existent , they 're rude and slow .
also their gel products are cheap .
i chose a different color just in case it was that one batch .
but no .
same thing happened again and they refused to give me my money back .
do n't waist your time or money with these people .
complete rip off !
they decided to charge me extra _num_ for gel polish .
but no those prices do n't matter !
i do not recommend this place .
but i had the worse experience ever .
i got a gel manicure and a spa pedicure .
i probably wo n't come back here again unless i 'm short on time .
i could 've left to get food and been back in that time !
worst place in town by far !
ive been here three times and it gets worse every time .
bad service and would not recommend this salon to anyone .
worst decision ever .
my toes are still not dry .
it was so irritating .
i 'm glad i did n't .
i could n't believe it .
imagine if i would have got the cheap one ?
it was horrible .
seriously the worst place ever .
they are slow , rude and overpriced .
i was there for _num_ hours .
they were not busy at all still took so long to get me started .
i almost did n't because she was rude and slow .
the sangria was okay but not great .
the food was so greasy it was gross .
totally ruined my vegas vacation !
so , we ordered more ... big mistake .
everything else was just as disappointing .
and after all , it 's not his fault the kitchen is disgusting .
but if you like food and being alive do not eat here !
the worst meal ever !
it ruined out trip .
like a chain restaurant , straight out of a can .
the dessert was good , but not amazing .
must have been a bad day ?
cheap drinks !
that was ridiculous .
the portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish .
overall , the service was poor .
atmosphere was trying but lacking !
it was really loud and crowded .
the menu did not have anything very adventurous , in fact quite the opposite .
if you are looking for great tapas , this just is n't the place .
big mistake .
the tuna tartare looked like cat food .
i tasted no salt at all .
the thai beef salad was okay .
i found this very irritating .
the paella was really bad no flavor , the sangria no good .
my first firefly experience was at the downtown location and it was amazing .
so i then said , `` nope , i 'm done thank you '' .
did not enjoy the food .
it was nothing special .
service was terrible !
the _num_ star just goes to the sangria and that is it .
he was lucky he got anything at all .
so delicous !
this is the 2nd time i 've been here .
real mistake on my part .
so i wait some more .
there was me , and maybe _num_ other people at this bar .
i 'm thinking he just decided to blow me off .
it is fine if you do n't really know food .
i must say , i am glad we only ordered _num_ plates .
the thai beef salad tasted boring .
and the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much .
creme cheese ?
you would think someone would get _num_ + _num_ .
two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered .
at this point , i was at my limit .
firefly , this is my second visit .
i wont be returning for a long long long time , if ever .
the atmosphere was cool , but maybe i 'm not a spanish cuisine person ?
i swear to god , i tried almost every .
and i honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best .
tapas , no .
it 's crowded , dark , and festive .
ok - so far i 'm thinking we 're starting off right .
way watered down .
the better tapas were completely forgettable , the rest were actually bad .
i 'm sure we will not return .
results from the food samples may not be known until late in the week .
food was ok and service was really bad .
however , i think this place is over rated .
this place is soooo off and on to me .
ate there tonight .
i had zero to drink - zero !
then just shrugged me off .
worse experience ever !
we went back outside and waited another _num_ minutes ... still no one .
this was by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had .
they have _num_ locations ... this one is on eastern ave .
sliders were mediocre and a little overdone for my taste .
- the lobster `` escargot '' was terrible !
glad the server took it off our bill .
something going on with yelp review situation and this restaurant .
do n't let it happen to you .
stuffed eggplant and meatballs were good .
do not go here thinking you 're getting a great dinner .
food quality is average at best preparation completely uneven .
the favors were perhaps too bold for me that i could only eat one .
the tastes were unremarkable .
however , i do believe i 've tasted much better tapas before .
firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table .
the eggplant was so little , could barely taste it .
the salad was so salty that it was hard to finish .
i have been here maybe _num_ times .
bad idea .
we ordered _num_ different tapas , as well as alcoholic beverages .
i would come back , as long as i do n't have him again .
once they were dropped off , he came back to take our food order .
man , everything was awesome !
but our waiter was mia .
finally , i flagged down a busboy and asked for the check .
should 've gone zero .
_num_ stars for this location , _num_ stars for other locations .
sad how poor management can ruin a location .
guess they did n't learn much from that experience .
this is terrible .
however , this is not the first time i became ill after eating here .
after some time , i decided to give this place another chance .
it 's such a shame because firefly has delicious tapas and drinks .
this was my go-to place for a long time .
i 've already given this place a second chance .
i highly doubt it .
be warned , if they open again .
what happens in vegas does not stay there .
i just happened to get it the worst !
i 've been a firefly customer for _num_ years !
never have i gone through anything like this .
i 'm still in shock this has happened .
most expensive dining experience ever .
this place was not closed for `` renovations '' .
gals , i know what you go through and i feel ya !
shame on you .
the service was as snooty as i remembered it .
not my go to anymore , sadly enough .
i do n't know why i keep coming in these stores .
therefore i associate junk with the brand .
from start to finish it was truly an awful experience .
ridiculous how unprofessional he was .
totally unprofessional and uncaring to say the least .
i did n't want to put him through that again on another day .
i 'm so glad i never have to see them again .
i hate that he gets paid ( lots of money ! )
my insurance must of sent the referral over _num_ times .
i called and called and they said no no nope .
they said no because we had insurance .
i am completely amazed .
spend your dollars elsewhere .
fyi ... that triple shot game is a tourist trap and a scam .
in fact , why would even think like that ?
what a mistake .
the worst .
i had to spend a week in this garbage pit .
i was there for a convention , not gambling .
first , the mgm lion thing and now this .
anyway , on with the review .
i 'm not really sure what the theme of this hotel is .
there was hardly any walking space between and around the _num_ queen beds .
i 'm not even exaggerating .
the tables and the dealers were worn out and not in a good way .
oh well , at least this place provided me with another place to yelp !
if it was n't for the free offers i would n't stay here !
sometimes rio is just too far from all the action so we stay here .
the rooms are small and the walls are sooooooo thin .
everytime someone goes to the bathroom or shower ... ... .
ok , the casino is not that great .
it can get packed and that carnival thing outside is loud !
i know to us our brother is slow , but come on !
you ca n't judge him , you do n't even know him .
this is a really crappy hotel with really crappy customer service .
but i stayed calm and walked away .
it was ridiculous !
harrah 's is old vegas , meaning smokey and nasty .
they want your money .
just make sure you do n't have any breathing problems .
nothing interesting there .
with that in mind , this hotel did not impress me very much .
sparse would be one word that comes to mind .
some are quite annoying but they never stop !
worse still , harrah 's seems to be the only one .
the rooms are small and nothing special .
this hotel gave me the most frustrating experience i 've ever had in vegas .
i actually could n't wait to leave vegas because it was so miserable .
that is the biggest bull crap i have ever heard .
i will never stay or even enter this hotel again .
their service and quality were just poor all around .
ok , seriously , dude .
i am not about to get into everything , but be warned .
the prices are cheap and it is for a good reason .
of course they denied the whole thing .
even if they offer me a comped room , i will never go back .
las vegas first timer !
: ) so upgrade it is , to a suite .
so i guess it was ok ... but check this out .
sofa bed was hard .
so uncomfortable .
suite my butt .
probably wo n't come back here again for a stay .
as well has terrible customer service .
other than that i know why my stay was only $ _num_ a night !
the bathroom was extremely ridiculous ; it was something i have never seen before .
it was really disgusting .
however that lasted only so long , we were tired .
went back to the room around 6:30 in the morning and slept .
paris and all the other related hotels was booked .
never again harrahs , never !
my group decided on harrah 's for its location and relatively low room rates .
star reviews do n't make sense to me .
harrah 's was filthy , inefficient and sad .
then my room was n't ready for another two hours .
worst customer service ever ever ever .
have been here maybe _num_ years ago , pretty disappointing .
went to the cafe for diner and there _num_ prime rib special .
show just ok , long line to get drinks .
generally not good .
wo n't come back to harrahs again .
only problem we had was the noise factor !
it was very hard to sleep !
no view .
if the following did not happen , _num_ stars .
however , service is lacking .
security was rude and ignorant .
manager was rude as well .
the a/c in our room was so loud ... sounded like something was broken .
i stayed here for _num_ nights and i regretted every one of them .
they took _num_ days to set up the internet and still didnt get there .
go here to ruin your vacation ... .
i wish i would 've rather stayed at flamingo for the same price .
the service was very rude and unfriendly .
the rooms were quite noisy and not the cleanest either .
the cafe was decent for breakfast but we ate our other meals elsewhere .
the casino feels old and stinky .
overall , the hotel is not that great and the service is poor .
i would rather stay elsewhere next time .
if you do plan to stay here , please do n't have high expectations .
it feels like you went back to the 70s .
the room was so small and so was everything else in the room .
place is run down .
slow to get drinks .
luckily place was too expensive to stay .
if you 're booking a room , there are better options in vegas .
simply unacceptable in my eyes .
i called and complained and the first manager did n't even compensate me .
there is a serious lack of communication at this hotel .
it stinks of raw sewage and the bathrooms are awful !
needs renovations ... i definitely will not pay to stay here .
check in line was slow ... total rewards was a mess .
okay , i might be biased because i stayed at a different hotel .
i did n't even stay here so i am reviewing their casino floor .
stuffy is the word for it .
i confirmed that we would be given two beds and we accepted .
shame .
thoroughly disgusted with their pathetic hotel and security staff .
what goes around comes around , and they will get theirs !
update : again , just heard more stuff have been stolen from rooms .
i 'm begging you , please stay somewhere else .
this was not the case here .
i requested _num_ attached rooms for my party .
when i checked in , they gave me _num_ rooms on different floors .
the next day i went down and requested my room change .
anyway , the rooms are the pretty standard low budget hotel rooms in vegas .
you really get what you pay for here .
second , $ _num_ per day for internet ?
fourth , the room was not clean .
i would n't stay here again .
seriously , security needs to take a giant step back .
ridiculous !
this place sucks ass .
all in all , i would not stay there again .
rooms are also not very good .
unless you got nothing to loose with you do n't go here .
really have received no satisfaction from hotel or risk management firm .
also rooms a little worn .
i stayed here the past month and did not like it at all .
i stayed at harrah 's the past week and it sucked .
also it was more expensive than before .
when i checked into my room , the bathtub had a clogged drain .
so after asshole leaves , me and my dad left the room shortly after .
the tables are hit or miss and the amount of smoke is ridiculous .
_num_ star : cheap cost of hotels , good location to venetian and bellagio .
nothing drops besides the bills in your wallet .
i actually tend to really like harrah 's casinos .
this one , however , not so much .
in all honesty , i 'd prefer my _num_ minutes back .
it took me the entire trip to figure out my way around .
the pool is the worst i have seen in vegas .
there is no sun on the pool at all .
i would not stay here again .
another comped room so we gave it a try twice .
hotel gets very crowded and there is not much walking space .
not very big , but they do the trick .
just make sure you do not get rooms with connecting doors .
this was the worst casino we visited while in vegas .
one word : gross .
the room itself is n't horrible .
the bed in comfy though , so that 's a plus .
almost $ _num_ for eggs , bland potatoes and sausage links .
she said it might cost $ _num_ for a half day rate .
mini suite room - more expensive no couch room was run down .
windows so dirty you could n't see through them .
room service got a simple one entree order wrong .
gross would never stay here again and i am pretty easy to please .
my husband and i came here to gamble during our stay in las vegas .
the service was just all around terrible .
the dealers we had were just awful , we were at the blackjack table .
kind of ridiculous i thought .
she was just absolutely terrible .
she was rude and just so cold .
i ca n't imagine what this place is like as a hotel .
just about everything here is understaffed .
wifi is there , but hella hard to connect to .
it is _num_ .
what kind of hotel does not have wifi ?
not for fee and not for free .
harrahs has no .
not at any price not free not for a fee .
motel _num_ has wifi .
the starbucks in paris has wifi .
the starbucks in harrahs does not .
is wifi so important ?
harrahs is not where i will be staying ever again .
so forget them and the horse they rode in on .
there on business and not good .
front desk was not helpful at all .
i had mixed feelings about the other features of the hotel .
beware - poorly run operation here .
was in two different rooms , neither had internet available .
its obvious the do n't vacuum here .
drain in the bath tub could n't keep up with the shower .
for the price here its not worth it .
the rooms are very outdated early _num_ 's maybe ?
we wo n't be back .
our stay at harrah 's was a big disappointment .
just okay : room , service , pool , prices .
preferred the flamingo from previous trip .
nothing terrible , just no reason to go back .
room _num_ : rude front desk managers .
dog urine stains on sofa corners shower curtain full of mold .
i stayed here and hated it .
there just feels like there 's nothing special here .
if there were 1/2 star options i would rate it a _num_ .
but ... and it 's a big one - the room sucked .
oh , and if you want to enjoy the pool - it sucks .
sucked .
old and musty smelling room .
well , smelled more like an ash tray now that i remember .
i would be very very careful about going back there .
it put a bad taste in all our mouths .
at 4pm this would be annoying , but at 10pm this is unacceptable .
i dont want to give them even one star .
slow to check in , old and parking lot smells .
my boyfriend , his dad , and i stayed at harrahs .
so , they came and ripped off the blow dryer from the wall .
ugh .
this is by far the worst experience i have had at any hotel .
we will not be coming back to stay , ever .
the worst hotel experience ever !
they said ok , you just need to come down to the lobby .
why do n't you tell me when i called ?
this is not it .
then he goes , '' ok , i get it .
-- -- -the hotel itself was also disgusting !
someone 's vomit was on the hallway outside the elevator for the whole night .
do not put your vacation in risk !
it 's ridiculous .
last , and certainly not least , they lack wifi .
pretty bad experience with this hotel .
this hotel has no customer services at all .
check out early because did not feels safe in the hotel another day .
very sad !
my room was very substandard .
this place sucks compared to newer hotels .
i looked around and left , it was just too busy .
the real problem later was the way i was treated by security .
there were no cabs outside .
shame on harrah 's .
i was pretty disappointed with their front desk customer service .
the lady i had was not very professional at all .
negative : this is one of the older hotels .
stayed in the mardi gras tower on the 16th floor .
the room was dirty and several things were broken or in need of maintenance .
air quality is poor .
casino is very smokey and the air does n't seem to be filtered .
free shuttle to rio , bally 's and paris .
airport shuttle is $ _num_ per person - cash only .
higher tier rooms are of better quality .
the place has aged and is in need of some serious updating and renovation .
the casino is nothing special .
the buffet is just o.k .
worst of the worst in customer satisfaction .
no more .
the hotel room was fairly clean , bed was comfy .
we had a few problems with the room though .
the thermostat did n't work .
it stayed _num_ and above in the room .
not cool .
the tv remote was missing but did n't call for that .
i just got tired of calling .
and harrah 's does not have wireless !
we wo n't stay here again .
plain and simple , the lobby in here has seen better days !
now i totally understand the ash tray smell in vegas .
however , this lobby absolutely reeked of cigarettes !
cheap place to stay .
but the rooms are tiny and the beds are not that great .
the best cheap hotel that i prefer is the flamingo .
around the same price so i wo n't be staying here again .
first , i made a reservation on a third party website for _num_ rooms .
harrah 's said , `` no prob . ''
then i show up , and my reservation has been cancelled .
i am not kidding .
our particular room was very dark even with all the lights turned on .
the casino is outdated and lacking in the slot machine area .
me , i think harrah 's sucks .
the carpets are stained , the ceilings are low , not very inviting .
the casino was pretty good and you could get drinks without waiting too long .
the only good thing about this hotel is the location .
my 10th time to vegas and this is my least favorite hotel .
he doesnt offer to give me another one and was very rude .
alot of trash walking around if ya know what i mean .
the carpet is nasty .
for $ _num_ extra dollars .
resort fees were indeed included , as well as upgrade fees .
however , we definitely will not be staying here again .
i mean everything from the parking garage , elevators , walls etc .
this place is disgusting .
horrible mistake !
fridge did n't work until the next day and got that comp 'd too .
our room seems to be assigned to someone else .
the bathrooms are horrible though , you ca n't hardly see anything in them .
over all i probably wo n't choose to stay here on my own .
the only reason why i went here was someone else was paying for it .
as another reviewer said , this place is dirty .
ok , do casinos attract the greatest of folks ?
no , but the crowd at harrah 's seemed extra scary .
the next time i 'm in lv , i 'll be skipping this place .
she offered to upgrade our room to a pool view for an extra fee .
after suggesting a free upgrade for his birthday , i was rudely shot down .
_num_ queen beds instead of one king !
we have had a bad experience since day one at this hotel .
on the second day we realized that the walls are not sound proof .
we could hear our loud neighbors .
instead i got a service that even the worst motel would never give .
buyers beware you have been warned .
the location did n't disappoint .
the rooms sport terrible lighting and there is no free wi-fi .
_num_ ) rude .
this gentleman was very accommodating and polite .
all-in-all , vegas was great , harrah 's was not .
save yourself some trouble and take your business elsewhere .
i just signed up for yelp to write a review of this hotel .
( but that thing never happened . )
rest of staff never gave me a shit .
also , i witnessed _num_ more people having trouble with their keys .
the hotel does not have wifi access .
i saw a women fighting with manager for that issue , which was useless .
the safe also was n't working .
i was so frustrated with this hotel and casino .
everything else was just ok .
worse customer service , specially in the cafe .
we will no come back .
poor service .
because i certainly left with a bitter taste in my mouth .
_num_ minutes ?
_num_ minutes ?
_num_ minutes ?
borderline ridiculous .
unacceptable .
no one in that line will be staying at harrah 's again .
can i tell you how totally disappointed i was in my stay ?
the manager was a tall man , bald and was not sympathetic at all .
`` new york is very expensive '' .
then when the clerk asks for my id she comments on my coach wallet .
coach is very expensive '' .
another issue once in the room at harrahs was the ac .
once we went outside or to another hotel , we were fine .
do not get the buffet .
not good .
rooms are old as well as old nasty carpet .
do n't do it word of advise .
told me my room as recently renovated .
either that 's not true or they upgraded with cheap material .
there was mold in the shower .
room just looks cheap .
carpets in the hallways were completely dirty and stained .
on the upside , the blackjack dealers were great .
but even for a free room , i would n't return .
and lastly , no wifi .
only old school cable internet .
this place is an absolute joke .
sat down with my boyfriend and a friend at the electronic roulette table .
unfortunately , he was worse than her .
i advise that you avoid this place at all costs .
and as an added peeve , the bathroom light is n't very great .
i would also not use their on-line deals .
stay away and have a better experience in las vegas .
first of all the rooms are very outdated .
the hotel has not internet .
no i didnt mean no wifi , i mean no internet !
people this is _num_ what are you thinking off ?
aside from that not worth staying there unless they comp you a room .
stay away if you have moderate standard requirements .
i think it sums up how old and backwards the hotel is .
on a good note , the room is clean and the beds were comfortable .
the only positive is its at the center of the strip .
as most of vegas , the hotel smells like smoke .
rooms are ok clean but no wifi , are you kidding ?
absolutely terrible hotel , the worst i have experienced within the north america .
no internet , noisy crappy conditioner , no ventilation in the rooms .
worse than any hotel or motel i have ever been to !
the next thing why i do n't like this hotel are the rooms .
and not to mention the shower drain was terrible .
but we notice not one difference in the room after that whole ordeal .
all in all i 'm pretty disappointed with this hotel .
hell the super _num_ across the way was a better stay than here !
we paid _num_ the shit .
the only good thing about this hotel is it 's location .
circus circus is cheaper and they actually have wi-fi there !
great location on the strip , but this place is otherwise pathetic .
half the elevators work , half of them do not .
i can not wait to check out of this place .
i called guest services and they were really rude to me about it .
a half hour later , no one had come .
_num_ minutes later , still nothing .
it was a mess , i was very disappointed .
yeah , no never again will i stay here .
visited during spring break _num_ with my husband .
which is n't saying much .
would not pay to eat or gamble there .
reeked of cigarette smoke , looked outdated and the staff looked dated too .
the rooms are small and the check-in staff is barely accomodating .
worst experience in vegas by far !
and it wouldnt turn back off !
so i had to sleep with the tv on all night .
( without a picture ) what a nightmare .
horrible service , dirty rooms and broken tvs !
horrible place to stay !
rooms are gross !
_num_ min to check in .
we had such an unpleasant experience i need to warn people .
rude does n't begin to cover it .
we left and went to starbucks , where the counter woman was delightful !
they do n't tell you that when you book the hotel .
stayed friday and saturday night there this weekend .
no big deal , right ?
nope ... was n't me .
told my husband to hit the rain locker because he stunk .
wo n't be going back anytime soon .
this place just really needs an overhaul to bring it up to speed .
do n't ever stay here !
they give you soap for the shower but no hand soap for the bathroom .
the only problem was the bed and the awful sheets !
the ladies then went out around _num_ .
a fairly miserable night for $ _num_ more than the original price .
the hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip .
i recently stayed here on a quick _num_ night trip to vegas .
the only good thing about this location is the location .
no theme to the casino as opposed to other hotels .
the gambling options are limited and the slots are outdated .
no wifi offered either .
i would choose the flamingo rather than harrahs .
virtually every person was displeased with their room in one way or another .
wo n't stay there again .
_num_ nights $ _num_ , not well spent .
slots were good , tables not good .
getting a drink while playing was n't always the fastest .
_num_ minutes at least with no clean up .
ca n't take food to go unless you sit down .
terrible service .
checking in , the lady was rude .
the go into _num_ room & it was dirty .
trash on the floor and someone had obviously been laying on the bed .
the refrigerator was not working & had mold all in it .
the worst first impression ever !
the internet is horrible .
most pages wo n't load , if they do it takes 3-4 minutes .
booked this hotel for a business event -- meeting room and several guest rooms .
they were very courteous and helpful .
this place does n't care about you at all .
worst hotel experience of my life !
i have never seen an air filter as filthy as this one .
disgusting and filthy dirty carpets in the guest rooms .
gross !
no excuse for this .
not worth it .
_num_ for room service , the food was actually awesome .
cheap hotel on the strip with an embarrassing atmosphere ( circus ?
worst customer service ever !
not to mention the best rooms !
if u gamble do n't waste ur money to any total rewards casino !
i got sick after a day being there real quick .
the whole room was pretty dirty especially the whole bathroom .
i could not win with these rooms .
i was treated very poorly by their supervisor joy .
instead of helping the situation , she wanted to get rid of me quickly .
beware , they only want your money .
to this day , i still have not received my refund back .
worst hotel ever !
terrible management , terrible food , terrible rooms !
does n't deserve a star at all !
very disappointed customer .
so i purchased the closest available seats which were around $ _num_ a ticket .
thanks for nothing .
in a jungle full of competitive hotel service , harrahs lost my business .
but the pillows were hard and the beds were harder .
will not be visiting harrahs in the future .
this is just terrible and unacceptable .
could n't sleep at night and was very uncomfortable .
first of all , they now stop serving breakfast at 11am .
between 11pm and 6am , your room service food options are ... nothing .
what a disappointment .
a year ago , i probably would have given harrah 's three stars .
the smell is that of a _num_ year old ash tray .
the uniforms , brand in general is just terrible .
no water in the room .
the a/c 's auto function didnt work .
harrahs casino in las vegas , what can i say .
anything to try and take a buck from ya .
gross .
nothing luxury about it .
rooms are very old and tired .
everything in the room is beat up , old and/or stained .
, but harrah 's has nothing to set it apart .
the sports book is small and cramped , as is the poker room .
there are n't a lot of great restaurants .
like i say , getting in and out of there now is a nightmare .
if you 're renting a car though , stay away !
a confusing parking structure with zero signage to help you get to the hotel .
i would n't stay here again if you paid for my room .
my room was a standard room , and it was motel sized .
the door nearly hit the toilet when you would close it .
the shower never completely stopped running during my entire visit .
i tried to pull the water temperature handle tight and this did n't work .
my first day when i arrived in the room it was _num_ degrees .
i like it cold , i usually set the thermostat at _num_ .
so , i set it at _num_ before going to gamble for the afternoon .
needless to say , this was incredibly annoying .
we did try the oyster bar for lunch , and it was okay .
newer casinos have bathrooms placed better along the gaming floor .
this place is an absolute dump !
i do n't get how this place has so many good reviews !
the 1st impression when we walked into out room was omg !
the only great thing about harrahs is the location which is central to everything .
the smoke became overwhelming ... most casino 's have great ventilation .
this room is painted white with nothing in it .
i was disappointed and disgusted .
the spa was the worst experience i have ever had in a spa .
purchased weekend stay thru expedia .
car window was broken into in their parking garage .
did not think one would actually be my car unfortunately .
find a hotel with parking security , saves you more money in the end .
got a comped room for _num_ nights here .
very disappointed this time .
get to room and it does not look newly renovated .
worst setup i 've seen in a hotel room .
no counter space at all to set and alcohol or food or anything on .
upon staying i realized more and more things wrong .
there is a tv in the restroom but no remote for it .
mechanics might need some more training too .
but no .
i never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers .
( spa , gym , pool , wi-fi , etc ) .
cheap price .
room is outdated .
this hotel sucks .
this place is the complete opposite .
this place is extremely understaffed .
would n't stay here again .
as soon as you walk in the door , you can smell the smoke .
if not , they need a new one .
overall disappointing .
harrah 's is in serious need of a complete renovation top to bottom .
our room in the mardi gras tower was sub par at best .
the sink was clogged even after maintenance worked on it for _num_ minutes .
my aunt was in shock and she was embarrassed .
she did n't want to stay at harrahs anymore .
i am totally disappointed that this is what the new harrahs has become .
but they could n't with harrah 's terrible wifi .
interesting and very cheesy since the room was ready anyway .
no coffee maker in room .
toilet would n't flush properly .
had to add water to get any pressure at all .
i hate they charge for wifi .
i went downstairs to print out my boarding passes on a paid terminal .
he was very rude and even said `` welcome to big business ! ''
the poker room card shuffle machines hardly work .
i wish i could review the hotel separate from the staff .
too yucky to take pictures .
my room , i did not love it .
i would say the worst was that the ac did not work !
it was to hot in there i could n't sleep .
if i could give negative stars i would .
worst customer service i have ever ever witnessed .
no one did anything .
no one offered to comp my room .
the gm did n't even apologize .
do n't worry this establishment will be hearing from my attorney .
it smelled like old motel .
it does not compare to the one in southern california which is way newer .
too pricey for the quality .
worst place i have ever stayed at .
this hotel seems to be very poorly run .
the room itself needs some work .
they literally walk around and kick people out of the pool area at _num_ .
yet our friends had called _num_ minutes before and got the extra hour .
well , i m not standing in line again for sure .
she says `` your room might not be ready !
but of course , i didnt say a word .
i felt awkward and said good morning .
is n't it your responsibility to greet the customers first ?
that _num_ star is for hospitality .
did they ever bother to call us ?
staff was extremely unhelpful .
no one said `` oh that sucks i 'm sorry . ''
for what its worse : they said car break ins happen regularly .
i upgraded to a suite , total nightmare .
harrahs room was old , stinky and in horrible condition .
the couch did n't even belong in the goodwill .
stains on the carpet , and the beds were in horrible condition .
bye bye harrahs .
i was very disappointed with this property .
i 've stayed at many caesars properties but this one has been the worst .
we arrive and there are _num_ front desk windows open .
the other lady was trying to rush through the busy line .
and yet i do n't care i refuse to wait in line any longer .
two dirty coffee cups are outside my door when i checked in .
worse than that , they were still there when i checked out .
this casino is a bit tired for las vegas .
, things got annoying upon our arrival at the harrah 's .
there goes _num_ star .
that 's horrible !
there goes _num_ star .
the decor is very outdated and dingy , they need a whole update !
the colors are just dreadful .
the room was just a basic king room , but the tv channels sucked .
come one , this is _num_ !
there goes _num_ more star !
the wifi was `` down '' for the whole time we stayed there .
the staff seemed burned out , and not to care about good customer service .
customer service not nice at all .
ridiculous !
out dated casino , this visit brought too many additional ridiculous charges .
such a nasty attitude .
do n't believe their advertisement of `` free '' wireless .
old , dingy , better places to stay .
apparently it 's a `` request '' not a reservation .
it was room _num_ .
here comes the biggest problem ... .
the hotel is ok nothing special but not horrible .
so , _num_ minutes later , we were finally on our way .
we called back , were put on hold and disconnected .
really , is this how you run a business ?
it was truly disgusting .
words can not describe the disappointment i feel .
_num_ minutes after that we ordered water to drink .
_num_ minutes later , no water .
the lady looked at us like we had _num_ heads .
it took them _num_ minutes of research to get nothing .
if i could give this hotel _num_ stars , i would .
that 's just horrible management and customer service !
it took security at least _num_ minutes or more to come to the room .
the lights were so dim that you could barely see anything .
that took about _num_ minutes as my phone was dying .
the iron was broken so i could n't iron my clothes while i waited .
i reached out to a manager to inform her of the horrible experience .
checked in here to mardi gras tower .
there went our upgrade and we had to cancel our dinner plans .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
do n't stay here .
by far the worst service i 've ever experienced during a stay in vegas .
so we are upset but obviously need to catch some sleep .
worst hotel ever .
everyday i need a new room key they never work .
anyway , the slots downstairs in the casinos were actually pretty cool .
when i sat down , the bartender greeted me and i ordered a water .
he refused me again , so i requested the supervisor .
over _num_ hours for check in .
only _num_ check in agents .
overall not a good time .
she could n't explain it .
finally she hands me the confirmation that it sent .
staying in this hotel was the worst experience we had .
the parking lot has no cameras .
probably not .
we have been loyal to harrah for over _num_ years .
sorry harrah but you lost our business .
should be no star .
pee in the toilet , towels on the floor .
wait time is over _num_ hours , and we are still in line .
i never stayed at the harrahs , and i never will !
motel _num_ with a casino attached .
the whole floor that my room is on smells like a locker room .
do not stay here .
the manager could not handle the situation .
( waiting since 11pm ) .
more than a _num_ people were left stranded for hours .
i stayed here last week for _num_ nights and quite frankly it sucked .
also , no fridge !
terrible service .
room was n't great by any standard .
check in took over an hour , with only _num_ people work .
i would n't recommend this hotel , if you could avoid it .
my family stayed here for _num_ nights when we went to vegas .
but it is really quite a shame that this only deserves one star .
one being that the toilet was making a lot of noise .
it left the floor very wet and yucky .
overall , harrah 's is a terrible hotel .
i do not recommend this hotel to anyone .
worst `` premium '' room ever .
black mold under the sink and on the cabinet .
unfortunately we are stuck in this horrible room for the next _num_ nights .
do n't do it unless you absolutely have to .
the mardi gras tower needs an update badly .
the halls smell , and the rooms are small and ugly .
the carpet is disgusting .
housekeeping did a mediocre job .
we get on the shuttle only to find it charges _num_ a head .
i do n't care about the fee i care because he lied to us .
unfriendly clerk at counters .
the carpets stink , the rooms were not cleaned and also stunk .
very poor customer service at front counters and cleanliness .
we rate the place less than a star !
i would not suggest staying here if you can afford better .
our room smelled awful and the floor was wet .
the casino staff is more helpful than the hotel staff .
every thing else sucks .
it was _num_ pm by the time my name issue was resolved .
found out our room was not ready .
it was supposed to be ready by _num_ pm .
the front desk lady kept trying to put me into a smaller room .
leave our luggage with her and come back at _num_ am to check in .
no employee or manager once apologized for their screw up .
they made no attempt to make the situation right .
their rates are n't nearly cheap enough to justify the extreme poor customer service .
_num_ hours to check in !
waited _num_ hours !
manager was rude , grumpy and unapologetic .
room is outdated and not properly cleaned .
why would anyone want to play here ?
only reason to stay here is for a cheap night along the strip .
this place has gone downhill .
what a mistake .
all of the poor reviews are right .
our poor experience started right away .
_num_ minutes later , we got checked in .
shower was n't even hot one morning , and leaked .
shady business practice , but that 's vegas .
the only plus was the location , which was next door to my conference .
but this property in las vegas is old , dirty and low class now .
i mean black and dirty on the cushions , arms and back .
i did n't sit in it or set my luggage on it .
the windows were so dirty it was honestly hard to see out them .
there 's no mini bar or snack center in the room .
we wo n't be staying there again .
if you 're getting free room offers , this is an okay hotel .
i spent so much money to play in this casino .
so rude !
worst experience ever !
will not be coming back .
horrible experience .
the pool was also just ok .
some where you would think ok this could happen or whatever .
she honestly ruined my entire experience at this hotel .
i think i might think it twice .
do n't even want to take a picture for the room .
i stayed out to gambling all night rather than sleeping in the room .
this is the worst worst place ever !
did n't give us confirmation of this ur reservation .
the most racist people ever and thieves !
of course there were n't any seats at this point .
amazingly , no one bothered us .
then why was the check-out sign placed there ?
i wish i could give zero stars .
we were ignored by almost every staff member .
very disappointed with their lack of customer service .
will not return again and will not recommend anyone else either .
it was a huge mistake .
i 'm thinking omg this is discussing .
next thing we know , our door room is open .
no hair !
are n't they making enough money off the casino ?
during my stay here i 've been quite disappointed .
in the mardi gras floor the rooms are extremely dated .
the food in the restaurant is extremely overpriced .
one bowl of soup from their food court was $ _num_ .
a caesar salad $ _num_ for a sit down breakfast $ _num_ .
old and tired hotel !
very disappointing for a las vegas hotel .
i agree with all the bad reviews , save your money !
generally the hotel is n't too bad .
a little out dated and the air quality is n't the best .
i paid $ _num_ for early check in and it was ready as promised .
they also offered to remove the $ _num_ early check in fee .
i mentioned the cigarette butt in the hall as well .
tv was ok , though for some reason the sound kept going out .
there was a tv in the bathroom but there was no remote to it .
by the way , the butt stayed there for _num_ days .
stayed there recently with my husband and two daughters .
items stolen valued at approximately $ _num_ .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in !
horrible !
i have stayed in a much better motel _num_ .
the only thing i liked about this hotel was the casino and location .
the temperature said it was _num_ , but it felt like _num_ .
i booked a reservation online for $ _num_ ( december _num_ ) .
the location is fantastic for visiting the strip .
the people at the front desk are rude and incompetent .
paid $ _num_ for one drink , really ?
at first , i did n't mind paying for the drinks .
but the drinks contained almost no alcohol .
order shots or beer , do not get mixed drinks here .
the poker room sucked .
atmosphere was not live .
of the maid .
i would suggest bally 's or planet hollywood for the younger crowd .
i would not stay here again even if they paid me .
it is dirty and the clientele leaves a lot to be desired .
the employees are rude due partially to ownership changes over the last _num_ years .
many people do not know that harrah 's used to be a holiday inn .
only go here if you are expecting for over an hour to check in .
freaking long line but they only have _num_ employees working .
the third night the water was freezing cold and never got hot .
your housekeeping staff simply forgot us .
the floor we were on and the room itself were musty and moldy smelling .
i have never stayed at harrahs , so figured i 'd try it .
big mistake !
wrong !
she first said none were available .
told her it was unacceptable .
when i complained , they did n't even apologize .
i do n't recommend & wo n't be back !
i feel like there is no way possible to win .
played almost all week , nothing .
my advice ... do n't even try it .
but nothing like this .
that 's how horrible it is .
there was no mention of resort fees being added .
zero stars would be too generous for this crap hole .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
mini fridge did not work .
the walls are also paper thin .
my tip , do not come here .
the staff made things worst .
i 've stayed here almost every time i visit vegas .
fyi i have always called in to book my reservation .
calls does n't take several days to pull .
it was so loud and lasted it for over _num_ minutes .
i 'm sick of this shit .
this hotel was booked in error .
but , i had trouble .
check-in was a disaster .
she sent me to the platinum line , where i still had to wait .
`` no , your staff sent me here . ''
nowhere on my receipts did it mention the $ _num_ .
she insisted that i would get it back if the room was not damaged .
the room i was sent to was already damaged .
the door frame that houses the numbers was torn off .
and the room did not have a window that opened .
i called , `` yes , there is a technical problem .
no shower , etc .
worst part : i wrote one of the operations managers .
avoid this hotel , .
if you want them to print out your boarding pass another $ _num_ .
there are much better options on the strip and especially off the strip .
we stayed here for about _num_ days .
our hotel room was clean and tidy , nothing special though .
my biggest complaint was our hotel room key cards would not work !
do n't come here if you want to stay because of the service .
since i could not get back to sleep , i decided to go out .
_num_ hours later , i returned to my room .
it had not been touched !
they also charge over $ _num_ per day for a resort fee .
stayed here for _num_ nights on a recent trip .
the room was large enough to accomodate the roll away without feeling cramped .
the smell when you walk in is overwhelming .
not sure if it 's really any better than the smoke itself .
serious gives me an instant headache .
not much good to say .
lame .
as far as standard bathroom amenities go , this room was totally sub-par .
there was a bath bar , facial bar , and bottle of hand lotion .
do not stay here .
thrown in the towel ?
speaking of towels , the pool is n't open at all .
full cost for resort fees though .
returned to our room at 3pm and there has n't been any maid service .
gross !
zero satisfaction .
they have let themselves totally go down the toilet .
the room and hallway look tired and dumpy .
the ceiling has an ugly water leak stain across the top .
it was disgusting .
by the way the room service stops at 11:00 pm and the menu sucks !
a lot to be desired .
wifi did n't work .
the worst hotel i 've ever had in vegas or maybe anywhere .
whether you 're on a smoking floor or not , you are .
it was a nightmare .
i have not stayed here in years .
horrible stay !
had to go up _num_ floors for an ice machine !
i just left ; hungry and disappointed !
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or coffee maker .
the deposit was to be refunded if not used .
i was not refunded the deposit and it was charged to my credit card .
we have stayed at harrahs las vegas a half dozen times .
unfortunately this last stay rubbed me wrong at the start .
finally about _num_ i go wait in line again.
they told me to speak to a hotel manager , yet none were available .
he could not have been any more rude .
he told me that there was nothing he could do for me .
horrible host !
standing around chit chatting asked for a host _num_ times !
so disgusting to live and sleep in a room that reeks of stale smoke .
this was n't just our problem .
the customer service was terrible .
very disappointing .
me and my wife will not be coming to this place again .
the location is great but the check-in process is the worst .
i could n't believe it .
it was a horrible experience do not stay here !
no explanation , just `` you ca n't '' .
the maintenance man that came was grumpy and halfway rude .
overall , a terrible experience on day _num_ .
the silver lining ... the valet guy was super nice .
the worst place i 've experienced in vegas !
but what do you know it fails yet again .
strike one .
staff is rude and not helpful .
bad experience from start to now .
worst hotel in vegas !
i cant find any other words to describe this wait besides pure torture !
my advice : stay away from harrahs !
i wish i could leave zero stars !
we came back _num_ hours later and the room still was not ready .
and most likely it 's going to be more than _num_ minutes !
overall hotel look is very outdated .
the resort fee was a little pricey considering how outdated the hotel is .
most disrespectful , horrible customer service ever !
they never even sent someone up to clean our room !
i 'll give the _num_ star to that !
never did i ever questioned any charges until this year .
charging me extra in my _num_ stays this year ?
would not stay here again .
after staying at the cosmo , we missed our flight .
even the toilet paper was of poor quality , like dollar store quality .
the furniture was all out dated .
and the entire casino smells like an ash tray .
worst hotel on the strip .
room was dirty , musty , smelled .
- the room , omg , the room .
even with the discount i would n't come back here .
they could care less about customer satisfaction .
_num_ ) of all my friends , checked in first .
was told there were no non-smoking rooms , so i took a smoking room .
i 'm not sure i understand why they did it .
they sure are terrible , though .
only gets a two star because of the location on the strip .
10/10 would not stay again .
rooms are quite run down .
no fridge or microwave in the room .
no remote for the smaller tv in the bathroom .
once we got to the room we could not cool it off fast enough .
the shower is terrible !
it 's just not my thing .
after reading the reviews maybe i should n't complain .
i probably wo n't be back for another _num_ years .
there are better places for me to spend my money and enjoy myself .
i think the resort fees are such a scam but no way out .
they are _num_ plus tax per day .
linens and towels were cheap and meh .
really would have preferred the old rooms .
really disappointed that a free room was a loss for me .
not excited about harrah 's as future accommodations .
this is a major hotel on lv blvd .
there are _num_ clerks working .
while checking in i was asked to pay $ _num_ for a resort fee .
no refrigerator .
blow dryer is broken and missing pieces .
bathroom tile is cracked and has chunks out of it .
when they did , _num_ days later ... no clean sheets .
this is not my first visit to a hotel or resort .
in fact , i lived in las vegas for _num_ years .
i am posting photos to back up my post .
shame on you harrahs !
either way , bad job !
the only positive thing about this harrah 's hotel is the location .
the food options in the hotel were terrible and were not open late .
and we do n't even know why the fire alarm went off .
the service is also very slow and the employees are not convenient .
terrible front desk service .
management was so poor that they could not help even when people were complaining !
terrible customer service !
booked the room though total rewards .
anyway i go to the vip area to check in .
desk clerk says can not take it .
not a problem at mandalay bay or gold coast we stayed at this trip .
the bathtub was disgusting , the fridge did not work .
this hotel is okay if you are barely in your room .
just to shower and sleep .
we stayed in the mardi gras tower and our room was outdated .
we also did the _num_ hr pass for the option of _num_ buffets .
i was shocked at how terrible my experience was this past june .
each employee we came into contact with was very helpful and apologetic .
i filled out the form , enclosed the keys and left .
clearly checking out of harrah 's is not a priority for management .
harrah 's has a serious problem with their check-in process .
i will never , ever , ever book harrah 's in las vegas again .
we got to play together , just not at harrah 's .
management would only comp one night of resort fees ( _num_ ) .
the front desk manager was rude to me .
i am platinum member and was treated terribly .
i do n't know what happen with this company but it 's horrible .
there was a very huge cockroach smashed in the bathroom .
no way .
i went in wanting to buy chocolate strawberries .
i put my chocolate strawberries back down and left .
major fail !
i did n't even like it .
sometimes , not everything is meant to .
i can get better quality food at a wolfgang puck express .
luckily , my company picked up the tab for this crap .
i 'd be embarrassed to come here again .
a wolfgang puck chinese restaurant .
expensive and not good .
why would anyone even consider eating here ?
note that drinks are extremely overpriced .
our waiter was practically invisible , until it came time to pay the bill .
i freakin hate that .
the only saving grace was that the drinks were strong .
i was so excited to try a wolfgang puck restaurant .
wow , this place was not good at all !
they also do n't know how to cook rice here !
was n't very warm either .
it 's shocking that it 's a wolfgang puck restaurant .
wolfgang , im disappointed in you !
the jasmine rice was also flavorless and a little rubbery .
for the price , this is not a good experience .
so obnoxious .
if your looking for excellent food for an affordable price , look elsewhere .
$ _num_ for my risotto entree ?
it was mediocre , and slightly undercooked .
but that was not worth it .
but again , not worth it .
i think in general service was terrible but the food was alright .
not awesome ... hey i live in chicago we know awesome filet !
after being seated ... no paella .
it 's vegas there are plenty of options !
very expensive for just pizza .
my halibut was decent , but presentation sucked .
the service was n't that friendly or that great .
i thought food was bland and you 're mostly paying for the ambiance .
the food was mediocre at best .
service was absolutely horrible .
our waiter was the worst i have ever encountered in my travels .
spago at the forum shops las vegas .
i was disappointed to say the least .
the calamari was not as disappointing , but i have had better .
dessert was a disaster .
no server stopped to see how everything was or if everything tasted ok .
i guess they do n't really care .
is n't wolfgang puck known for his pizza ?
it was covered in that orange grease and the plate was soaked with it .
we did eventually get our drinks , though .
i did not see the point to this place .
it was a bomb -- note , not the bomb , but a bomb .
as you go back into the restaurant , you never lose that mall feel .
the food did not save it .
so , picky had to send it back .
it 's not living up to the spago brand .
ate here on a saturday night .
overcooked and too much salt .
it was literally three bites .
i was with a group , so did not send it back .
quite frankly , the combination just did not work .
when i am paying over $ _num_ for a pizza , i expect better .
this is the second time i 've been disappointed with a wolfgang puck restaurant .
she was awful .
i ordered the pepperoni and asked for anchovies on it too .
the restaurant was n't even pack and there was barely anyone around us !
& & we did not plan to stay here for _num_ hours !
their vegetarian options were basically pastas so they were n't anything special .
there were about _num_ of us in the party .
it took us over _num_ hrs to get food .
the service as far as refilling our drinks was also horrible .
the place was basically empty , so i expect much better service .
needless to say , i wo n't be coming back .
the service was n't so great either .
i just did n't get the feel of an upscale pizzeria here .
i 've had way better pizzas .
_num_ star for our server which was horrible !
on to the food .
with the veal , i would skip it .
however the food was underwhelming to say the least .
yeah you do n't care .
hey spago , remember me ?
f u spago .
i came here like _num_ years ago , and i 'm still bitter .
this place does n't deserve the name `` spago '' on the sign .
the service sucked .
the food is very mediocre .
it was mushy and the sauce had the same taste as the canned stuff .
none of which has anything to do with the food .
first we arrived and they had lost our reservation .
so i 'm all dressed up and nowhere to go .
it was only 5pm so the place was only half full !
i would not recommend eating here unless you like to be treated like crap .
i have not walked out of a restaurant in _num_ years .
i did tonight .
believe it our not .
there are so many better choices .
the server was pretty poor .
we eventually asked for our check and left with an overall negative impression .
their was no wait to get a table .
i was soooo ... disappointed with my experience at spago , las vegas .
first off , the service was awful .
i really was disappointed .
based on our disappointing meal , we opted to skip dessert .
oh well ... better luck next time vegas .
absolutely the worst food !
not even one star !
the pizzas were soggy .
the pasta we ordered was very salty .
the lamb pizza was n't very good .
it was dry and flavorless .
other than that , the service was ok .
for such a `` fancy '' restaurant , this place was a disappointment .
we made a reservation , got in quickly , and put in our orders .
for two hours , all we ate was bread .
once we got the food , it was mediocre .
the dessert sounded so appetizing on the menu but i was very disappointed .
the food was over priced and had no flavor .
i just kept thinking this is such a waste of money .
wow what a huge disappointment .
the food was ok , i was n't impressed .
it was n't bad , but it was n't amazing .
the food here was the absolute worst .
food was tasteless , including the sauces , especially on the pizza .
so many places to dine along the strip - spend your money elsewhere .
garbage .
garbage .
garbage !
the entire back room was empty and ready for customers .
she just thought we were n't dressed well enough for the establishment .
thanks , but no thanks .
for an upscale restaurant , the service was horrible .
although the food was good , we 'll never go back .
terrible service !
white asparagus salad was tasty but tiny portion .
did n't live up to the waiter 's raves .
this was a big disappointment .
eh , not impressed .
we were checked on multiple times , water refilled often , etc .
honestly , i would much rather go to panera .
i would n't return or recommend .
pasta , pizza , salads , sandwiches .
everything was just eh .
would dine again , just at another table .
one of the most disappointing nights .
embarrassed as i took clients and raved about the service and food .
so disappointed .
worst meal i have ever had in vegas .
our fourth time eating at las vegas spago , not so good this time .
and i could not chew it at all .
very disappointed .
ps / not once did anyone ask us how our food was .
very disappointing !
the staff is indifferent !
left us for another _num_ or _num_ minutes , before coming back .
guess he did n't want us to try dessert .
our server comes over and says `` your entrees will be out shortly '' .
a few minutes later , he returned with our food .
literally ran through the casino to make it to our show on time .
_num_ stars only because the food was good - not amazing , but good .
my first course was the lobster salad ... .
it was not good at all .
minimal amounts of lobster ( come on , this is vegas !
my second course was the seafood risotto which was not bad .
i would have loved dessert , but that was not in the cards anymore .
nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters .
horrible table after setting up a reservation .
was not at all impressed with the food .
did not finish that dish .
disappointed in the meal and would not eat here again .
so i have bread and oil .
no pepper .
no salt .
no parm cheese .
this is nothing more than a huge tourist trap !
spago a total ripoff !
we had used a charge card , they had used a debit card .
he promised to investigate and get back to me promptly .
and no manager came out to apologize .
the staff seemed busy , but barely paid any attention to my table .
asked for a refill in our water , did n't get it .
the food is way too overpriced and not even good .
i wish i can give no star because i really hated this place .
this place really threw me off .
honestly one of the worst places ive eaten .
the servers were nice but the food is horrible !
i could not enjoy any entree on the menu .
we informed the bus boy and our waitress and nothing !
at some point , we were busy talking business and tried to ignore it .
at times , restaurants get confused between al dente and uncooked .
although the setting is beautiful , the experience was n't for us .
on the other side , servers were polite and the ambience were good .
service was awful .
overall , i was not happy .
the bill for four came to almost $ _num_ .
secondly my boyfriends pasta was luke warm .
he also said he would get it.
not sure what they could have done third time .
there are so many better choices in vegas .
another disappointing experience at a wolfgang puck restaurant .
the restaurant makes dinning difficult .
and the chef has a loud foul mouth .
what a disappointment .
poor .
overall , a disappointing meal .
shame , we had our hopes up .
maybe the staff was not well but i wo n't go there anymore .
do n't come here for the food .
go for the atmosphere , the name , to be seen , whatever .
i 've had better meals for 1/4 the price .
the tuna sashimi was almost flavorless .
prime filet mignon a little dry .
i used to eat here often , it 's gone downhill .
our most recent visit , however , was disappointing .
we wo n't be going back .
not off to a good start .
if i wanted fried vegetables , i would n't have ordered calamari .
bread - cold and burnt but the olive oil for dipping was good .
margarita pizza - mediocre .
they ran out of anchovies so i did n't get to taste that .
however , lacking in flavor all over .
pasta bolognese - i was underwhelmed and kind of sad by this dish .
not terrible , just ok .
which really made the overall experience worse .
overall , i 'm disappointed with the food .
it was not terrible at all .
the food was mediocre .
what a shame !
the food was delightful , but the service was lacking .
big mistake !
sadly , we probably wo n't be back .
what a disappointment ... we ordered _num_ pizzas .
should n't an expensive pizza have sauce and cheese ?
could hardly see it and certainly did n't taste it .
too bad they do n't put any ingredients on it .
over all a very overpriced mediocre experience from a big name chef .
waited about _num_ minutes for hostess to acknowledge us .
so we walked out !
nothing !
no dice .
i like the taco salad but havent eaten here in years .
i know mistakes are made .
he could of fixed it and blew me off .
she completely forgot about me and left me standing there .
please tell me why i would spend money with you ?
the worst service i have ever ever ever had !
however , the service at this particular store was sub-par .
i was pretty much ignored when i walked in and wandered around .
i totally would have bought more if the service would have been better .
i was completely embarrassed because i was covered in hot pink makeup .
awful awful awful service .
these girls were so unfriendly and completely wasted mine and my friend 's time .
um , no thanks .
she also took so long to refill it.
like on purpose , so slow .
it was really really disrespectful .
she also gave my friend the wrong products .
it was a truly terrible experience .
so wrong !
even my make up artist would n't ring me up .
this is by far my worst experience at a mac store .
surprisingly the places was pretty empty .
she just said `` oh okay '' and left .
she was helpful but looked like she did n't even want to be there .
all in all , this mac store is horrible .
this is by far my worst experience at a mac store .
surprisingly the places was pretty empty .
not a single employee offered to help at all . ''
so i grab in and go to the cashier .
no thanks !
never again will i set foot in this shop .
if you do not have an appointment there is a $ _num_ product fee .
i will not be booking at mac .
worst customer service ever !
i 'm giving one star but would give _num_ if i could .
we did n't feel like customers we felt like we were an inconvenience .
but instead we were treated like crap .
whatever , no problem .
the customer service here is horrible .
my second time around i called to make an appointment .
awful customer service !
no one greets me .
also , the manager , not too nice either !
guess their is just no winning with this location .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
nothing really different .
i was not even freaking out .
i am never going to shop there ever again .
a customer 's job is to browse , select and pay .
it was not my fault in the first place .
yet they made it seem like it was my fault .
i figured i could get that in a mac store ... i was wrong !
it was so weird .
he finished and handed me the mirror .
he insisted that i need to match my chest .
it was horrible !
maybe it was a fluke and it was just a bad artist i had .
terrible customer service .
will not be returning .
some of the so called make-up artist are not make-up artist at all .
there customer service is horrible .
never once did i get a greeting .
never again will i return .
terrible customer service !
next time we will go elsewhere !
the eye shadow display is not in order and missing at least _num_ colors .
i 'm embarrassed for you !
no smile and very rude .
: ( that 's so sad .
i wish i took the names down of the ladies .
the store was n't even busy at all .
boo , stay away from this store and check out the other locations .
and the store stinks like a sewer .
it was totally unacceptable for a restaurant to treat guests like this .
no offer to make things right or acknowledge his staff 's rudeness .
but i thought this place was terrible .
if the food is good , i really would n't mind or care .
the food was very underwhelming .
but this place was just ridiculous .
there was nothing surprising about the flavors out of every dish i tried .
actually , there were even parts of my pasta that were not fully cooked .
in addition , my friend asked for sorbet for dessert .
do n't be confused !
the food was n't bad but nothing too special !
i hate dark chocolate !
walked out .
no thanks .
way too expensive .
i would n't recommend anyone to this place .
as soon as we presented our coupon the attitude by the restaurant staff changed .
the original waitress that started us turned us over to another waiter .
then we were given a special menu and the choices were slim .
this should not have been presented as dinner , but rather a snack break .
overall poor experience .
this restaurant was a great disappointment .
unfortunately , the service was very slow .
we knew this was a bad sign .
but will not go back and will not recommend the place .
i 've never had service so bad at a fine dining restaurant .
the dessert was okay , chocolate ravioli and a berry and mint soup .
the problem was how we were treated .
i so wish that my review could be better .
but this wine list was overwhelming to say the least .
disappointing at best and i have a feeling the dressing was from a bottle .
it was not special and lacked flavor .
it was definitely not spicy , so that was a little disappointing .
sadly , we left before dessert .
like i mentioned , i wanted this to be better .
there is nothing wrong with this place .
overall , nothing was too spectacular about this place , but it tasted fine .
i sure as heck did n't want too .
frankly , the servers might have been pleased .
oysters are getting warm and there 's no champagne .
we see the manager , george , walk by with the champagne .
has no one trained these servers how to work in a nice restaurant ?
i was def expecting more out of this place .
this place has a lot to change , the decor is bad .
the food and drinks are bad , especially for vegas and the venetian .
the food is way over priced .
not home made at all .
do n't bother .
not bad , but not wow .
service is lacking .
went for brunch , which was expensive yet bland and ordinary .
others in my party of four were similarly underwhelmed .
i would n't recommend this soup .
my boyfriend had the veal dish with polenta .
our one friend ordered the swordfish rolls which she was actually very disappointed in .
besides the food being mediocre , the wait was forever .
this is where the nightmare began .
needless to say , we missed the show .
he really made the dinner uncomfortable .
the salmon was dry and lacking flavor .
for their specials they offered a short rib ravioli with black truffle .
but i was a bit let down by what i was served .
for dessert , the chocolate ravioli berries were delicious .
i do not think i would eat here again .
this was the most disappointing of all my dining experiences in vegas .
however , the service was a bit lacking and the food was rather simple .
i doubt they have many repeat customers .
the food was very salty and the serving portions were inconsistent .
i would not recommend this to anyone .
the mushroom pizza as an appetizer was very average .
the seafood linguine , however , as my main course was sub-par .
bland , with chewy bits of seafood .
the pasta even tasted cold .
i hardly tasted the cheese on my breakfast sandwich .
was the bbq stand next to the cafe .
none of us finished our scoops !
some of the bites were icy with only a hint of its flavor .
gross !
where in the world did you people get your gelato standards !
this gelato is awful .
maybe it was a bad apple day .
theirs is not .
cost me an arm and two legs : $ _num_ for two scoops .
hazelnut was not that good .
i wish an italian themed hotel & casino would serve better sweets .
their pistachio flavor did n't even taste like pistachio !
it tasted more like mint !
take your business somewhere friendlier , cheaper , better .
it almost convinced me it was worth the $ _num_ .
this is not it .
but seriously _num_ for one scoop ?
the service was horrific .
cost with tax : $ _num_ .
i ordered two scoops of hazelnut and vanilla for $ _num_ .
the gelato was very creamy .
that 's not how it 's supposed to taste .
come on guys , it 's not that hard .
my gelato tasted like crap .
not the best gelato i 've had in the states .
absolutely the worst gelato i have had .
i could n't even finish it .
what a waste of money .
this place should be ashamed for trying to sell gelato of such low quality .
the worst gelato i 've ever had .
ridiculous .
so many places to eat on the strip , i wo n't be back .
avoid avoid avoid !
service was horrible .
as a result , we were basically short of $ _num_ .
he was soo rude .
i left incredibly angry .
i would not recommend coming here at all .
their gelato was n't even that good .
the flavor was n't very brought out and it was too watery .
abysmal customer service .
also the one flavor i did try was bad .
my wife sampled _num_ and decided while son was still deciding .
she rudely said sorry no more .
i walked out of there .
not recommended at all .
worst customer service ever .
she asked my family _num_ times if we were together !
and she stayed to see if we left a tip .
gelato was tasteless and over priced .
i would n't eat there again .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing here .
i dunno .
but i was not pleased .
i am from la and i know mexican .
and this place is not mexican .
that is not authentic .
no flavor .
like _num_ cents for this , or a dollar for that .
our meals ( beef & chicken enchiladas ) were very very bland .
no spice , no flavor , bland , bland , bland .
but i would not go back here or recommend it to anyone going either .
but everything fell apart when my entree came out .
this was the most bland mexican food i ever tasted in my life .
i 'm not joking .
oh , and yes , the chicken also did n't even taste like anything .
i was n't impress .
even though the place was dead , service was slow .
a bit of a disappointment .
the hostess was very friendly and promptly seated us next to the canal .
this was very disappointing as the restaurant was by no means full .
the waiter never checked back in nor did the manager .
we left cash to cover the drinks , no tip .
i doubt i will ever go back .
ugh .
do n't set those expectations if you 're going to eat here .
they were awful !
the mushrooms were over-cooked and rubbery .
the queso on the tacos was bland and tasteless .
the tortilla for the tacos themselves was bland as well .
such a waste of food !
it really pains me to waste anything , especially food .
the service was also slow , curt and overall rather grumpy .
meat not that flavorful , and food served not piping hot .
ambiance / seating along the canal - _num_ stars .
nah , not great food , but at least it 's cheap .
food gets _num_ stars , but price gets _num_ stars .
_num_ tacos for $ _num_ - tasted like it was from taco bell .
salsa & chips for under $ _num_ and they gave a lot of salsa .
is it cheap ?
terrible coffee .
like real bad .
the chicken version went for $ _num_ cheaper .
the beans and rice were mediocre at best .
also , the hosts did n't smile at all .
but the service is terrible .
from there it was just a service nightmare .
most bizarre comment ever .
skip it !
it was just huge chunks of jalapeno and very little cheese and almost inedible .
$ _num_ house margarita for happy hour was nice .
coming from los angeles , i 've had my fair share of mexican food .
we ate here last saturday night .
we were really disappointed in our meals .
service was terrible .
the food was borderline at best - bland and unremarkable .
overall , the experience will not be bringing us back .
far too many errors for a sit down restaurant to be any good .
on the plus side , the tequila helped me forget the awful food .
this looked like it would fit the bill .
despite no reservation , we were seated in short order next to the canal .
it was perfectly adequate but nothing special .
to me , this was totally inedible .
needless to say , this was not a $ _num_ quality meal .
i was n't too hungry , so i just ordered chips and guacamole .
my other coworker got food poisoning after eating here .
all in all , i '' d never go back here .
horrible !
we ate out entire meal without any refills of our beverages .
when we discussed our concerns with the manager , his only response was sorry .
the experience did not make me want to frequent the establishment again .
the tortilla soup was more like a mole dip .
_num_ star is too much for this place .
the salsa is bland & no flavor .
the ceviche trio was not fresh n we had to send back .
the chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes .
i 'm embarrassed for this place and the mgr .
this place just is n't what it used to be .
not by a long shot .
and the relleno was just plain disgusting now .
it went from being their best dish in my opinion to the worst .
there is way better choices when it comes to mexican food in vegas .
very disappointed .
omg by far the worse .
it 's nothing but lemon juice , salt and beer .
do n't nickel and dime patrons paying $ _num_ for a burrito .
this place is not good at all .
the food was bland as well .
an hour into our meal , our dishes arrived and were flavorless and uncooked .
as it to your las vegas do n't do list .
this place is terrible .
nice spot by the canal , but food was n't worth the price point .
terrible .
ordered _num_ dishes and margarita - possibly the worst i have had .
chips and salsa are n't free .
no spanish rice .
but forget all that , the food is bland .
no taste .
disappointed for sure .
i was terribly dissatisfied by the pitcher of margarita that we ordered .
they were too sour to enjoy .
i would not come here for margarita unless it 's happy hour .
bad service with sub par food .
my toast for breakfast was on a hamburger bun !
cons : terrible & poor quality food .
now , i do n't even want to return .
meat just should n't smell or taste like it was made last week .
overall , just a horrible experience .
not what i want to be greeted with .
the tortillas were flavorless and basically fell apart in my hands .
we waited _num_ minutes before anyone greeted us or gave us water .
we were there for _num_ hours when it should have taken half the time .
the only thing delicious here are the chips .
drinks were ok , nothing special .
my boyfriend ordered the chicken fajitas and said they were terrible .
disappointed we wasted a meal here .
the customer service was awful .
very pricey for very bad quality food .
this place has a lot of potential for great food .
your money is much better spent in the venetian food court .
just ignored me .
bad stomach pain .
another person at our table had the same thing and same feeling .
i 'd skip this one .
unfortunately this time i came alone and received the worst service ever .
did n't help me not once i had to ask her for my bill .
awful .
the canal tables remained empty through our entire meal .
they charge _num_ dollars for chips and salsa .
any mexican place that charges for this is a joke .
then they delivered some barbacoa with rice and beans .
the rice was green and flavorless .
i 've had better seasoning on beans from a can .
the barbacoa was tender , but the sauce was awful .
there was no heat at all in anything .
it 's not worth going out of your way for .
it fell apart with a fork and was a little on the sweet side .
there are much better places for mexican food on the strip .
the food was n't so great .
the service here is very poor and slow .
slow to get drinks ordered and then the drinks .
our server seemed unhappy to wait on our large party and generally unhelpful .
they charge for chips and salsa as an appetizer .
the cheese enchiladas are ok covered with a spicy mole sauce .
- but the flavors are not right .
the tacos are neither street nor gourmet : on a par with chipotle .
horrible horrible place to shop .
when it comes to this one , i say just pass it up .
the walk ways are pretty narrow which makes things worse .
lots of random stores selling weird crap , and crowded !
a little dirty , and cheap feeling .
wish the shops were better .
i 've been in this place probably 20+ times and i still get lost .
it was in the sale section and was $ _num_ .
i 'm glad i at least really like the wallet !
ugh ... worst mall with so much promise .
unbelievable .
rude rude rude .
( ugh ) .
she opened the door only to find it occupied already .
i then headed back to the long line to wait my turn .
this place is the worst .
you ca n't find any restrooms .
i realize its vegas but no .
gross .
their staff was unapologetic and ignorant of their own facilities .
no ?
you fail hard .
this place sucks .
is n't this vegas ?
i wasted $ _num_ here when i could have spent it on something else .
that was the only cool thing about this place .
what a total waste of time !
no problem i thought , and proceeded to exchange my voucher .
after waiting a while , i asked the cashier where the operator was .
when i came back it was the same bs story .
do yourself a favor and stay far and away from this poorly run arcade .
i was just pissed that most of these freakin games were broken .
i hardly played anything else .
next time i can just use up this card real quick i guess .
not my first choice , but whatever .
i got the ribs dinner with _num_ sides for $ _num_ .
taste wise , it had no flavor at all .
the mash potatoes just suck .
i could n't quiet put my finger on what it tasted like .
the fries was n't anything special .
i got a steak knife , but no napkins or a fork .
food is your typical bar food , that just is n't good .
happy hour makes the prices better , but the food still taste bad .
staff really sucks here and do n't really want to help you .
it is n't quite as fun anymore .
me and my poor memory .
stopped by again _num_ days ago .
nothing special , but not bad .
this place just really is n't for locals over _num_ .
there was n't a very good selection of games in my opinion .
anything worth a damn is out of order .
waste of time .
the arcade was also a bit too dark and very dingy for my liking .
it 's not a huge place , either .
they only allowed drinks on the arcade floor anyways .
do n't waste your money or time .
it was the place to be when i was under _num_ though .
since i turned _num_ i never really gave the place a second look haha .
just hold out until you are _num_ boys .
i walked so much in two days that my feet had enough .
she looks at my purchase and starts talking to a customer about the merchandise .
the customer service not just sucked , but super sucked .
i could n't wait to get inside and try it out .
it too was bland !
damn , that 's too bad .
this did n't bother me much because i 'm tiny too .
there was shredded chicken and mexican rice in the bottom of the clear broth .
it 's not a place i would come to again .
the excitement ended with that sentence .
it was n't good at all .
i also was n't crazy about the take out presentation .
not sure i will be back to try another .
i ordered the torta and a mushroom quesadilla , based on another review .
but back to the torta that originally brought me in .
what was most disappointing was the flavor : there really was n't any .
i am not a huge mole fan , but it was tasty .
taco y taco is so much better ?
it 's ok not the best in the world .
the burger though , well , i think it needs a bit of help .
the bacon just left a bad taste in my mouth .
i would almost prefer no tomatoes by that point .
they got my order wrong .
customer service : the worst .
that 's the first thing that happened when i walked in .
and he did n't stop .
so i to get the one i wanted i had to pay the difference .
it all came out for $ _num_ .
i hate the help here .
even through the drive through people get weird .
ahh but make sure to check your things before you leave .
the cashier looked high and could n't understand who ordered what .
he did however give us a card for a free frosty next visit .
they have a system that does n't work .
when you come here do n't have high expectations about this place .
they simply do n't care .
she was extremely condescending .
these people are terrible .
do n't waste your time with this place .
if there was a way to give a place negative stars , i would .
she could not have been more correct .
this membership is $ _num_ .
she deserves a slap in the face .
you 're better off in the sun .
just paid my bill and closed out my account .
this is bad business .
all kinds of hidden fees they do n't tell you about .
ew seriously the worst company i 've ever dealt with .
sorry discount , i wo n't be back next week .
decent selection ok prices but very lacking on customer service .
i 'm officially done with discount firearms .
most are rude , condescending and unhelpful .
he just shook his head and walked away .
he took the gun from me and just walked away .
wiped it down , put it back in the display case and walked away .
he then just started chatting with other employees .
i still gave this place _num_ stars because their prices are hard to beat .
monday , june _num_ th .
they cater to tourist wanting to shoot guns .
there is no `` discount '' at this business .
it was pitiful .
my overall message to future gun and ammo buyers is to shop around .
most of the tourist i saw there were having a good time .
i would be very very concerned shooting in this environment .
there is nothing discount about this place .
on balance , the service here is hit or miss ( ha !
no pun ) .
from the moment i walked in the door i felt unwelcome .
both times i have been in here i have been disappointed .
as a result , this was a waste of my money .
he treated me like a kid who had no clue what he wanted .
he is an asshole worst service i 've ever had .
never get helped when i go in .
you have to try to find someone yourself , which is n't easy .
walked around for over _num_ minutes and no one said a word to me .
this is n't the first time this has happened either .
they do n't , but i should get the expensive one .
when john with the red shirt left , so did the integrity .
nothing special here .
a sales associate walked by and said he would be right back .
i tried to get there attention and they kept ignoring me .
maybe they were having a bad day .
we have been repeatedly disappointed by discount on basically every level .
big fat fail , discount .
ok so i come to discount every sunday or monday everytime without incident .
but today was the worst .
horrible .
i 'm always very polite and respectful but they are n't .
one time i had an incredibly bizarre experience with an african american salesman .
the bizarre thing was that i had clearly asked him if he minded .
i then replied `` i 'm testing the reset '' .
i could n't believe it .
the guy was condescending and rude .
this was our go-to indoor spot .
im usually not off sundays and i usually use their range on the weekdays .
am i losing sleep over $ _num_ ?
instead , they would rather take advantage of us .
i had to chase him down to get some questions answered .
thanks but no thanks .
this place is an ok place to shoot .
why buy things priced over what a manufacturer says it should be ?
it was truly disappointing .
$ _num_ they just lost .
and i will be purchasing more firearms in the near future .
not worth your time and money .
hopefully the other helicopter tours over the strip are better than this .
would not dream of recommending this to anyone .
the pilot had the tour down he was very knowledgeable about the strip etc .
ok , so this was miserable .
so _num_ hours later , i called .
keep in mind i was told previously 4:30 and 6:30 .
no ac .
cheap champagne .
and for a _num_ minute flight !
i just ca n't explain to you how miserable this whole ordeal was .
skip it !
i was wrong .
the office , looks like the waiting room at my mechanic 's shop .
there were about _num_ plastic glasses filled ( _num_ oz ) with champagne .
very tacky in my mind .
if you have to ask for tips , is n't that similar to begging ?
ok , i can see that but i have a reservation .
the ride is only _num_ minutes for goodness sake !
ok , at least she offered me something for their royal mistake .
i remain thankful for my luck .
found a deal online making the fly over the strip $ _num_ less .
_num_ ) the ride itself was okay .
however the company should change their name to hell air .
wandered back in to the packed waiting area .
* girl at counter was not helpful at all and had a bad attitude .
see the picture i took of their pathetic `` vip area ' .
ummm , hello ?
he slammed the door and gave pilot the thumbs up to go .
dont waste your money !
the night flight helicopter tour over the strip was extremely disappointing .
so disappointing , extreme waste of time and money .
staff is inattentive in their offices , letting people cut in line , etc .
this place needs a management overhaul and customer service skills .
unacceptable !
do n't use this company !
even after we landed the pilot said nothing .
i can not believe anyone was able to give this company a good review !
the phone call was n't all that pleasant but it was n't bad either .
ugh , it would n't let me give _num_ stars .
no one is answering the phone which turns out is a cell phone .
while waiting _num_ other groups showed up who were also supposed to fly .
long story short no one went up and we never reached them .
it was a total waste of time for all of us .
dont risk it book with another company .
this company is terrible !
i would not recommend to anyone !
every time they called and cancelled and rescheduled it was a different excuse .
i mean , $ _num_ for a sirloin steak ?
unfortunately my friends , count me back out .
service sucked as well .
the staff are second rate and are tired .
save your money and go to prime rib buffet .
i have never experienced a night like this .
skip it , took _num_ minutes to get a beer , in the bar !
food was pretty mediocre and the service was pretty terrible .
eat while watching your favorite sports teams .
the service actually is not good .
the waiter even gave my mother attitude when she asked him about a drink .
all we could hear was the booth 's next to us feed .
not so .
service was also somewhat lacking , despite it being early like i said .
`` uh , you are open , are n't you ?
i was annoyed .
overpriced , mediocre food .
`` _num_ min wait '' didnt sound bad so okay we waited .
so we get seated in a conference style room .
then the burger i had , tasted like cheap beef .
god awful food !
avoid their boneless buffalo wings at all costs .
no wonder they 're all closing down !
better luck next time !
first problem is their prices .
oh and btw there is also a weekly fee on top of all that .
our current daycare is only $ _num_ .
claimed they could n't handle her .
and the director is not helpful at all , she is rude and condescending .
the locker room is small .
the wet area is gross .
did a free day to try it out and did not like at all .
i have been paying for membership for over a year .
the equipment is broken , and desperately needs to be cleaned .
there 's mold on the floor around the pool and the spa .
benches .
i am so disgusted at the failure of this gym .
ladies locker room are not properly cleaned .
we do n't deserve poor quality because of you budget cuts !
worst gym ever .
i tried this gym for five straight nights .
except for one female employee , all of the staff are unfriendly .
not really a fan .
hotel needs is in need of renovation .
i spent _num_ nights _num_ days in this hotel in my visit .
meaning you have to spend about a minute to open facebook .
- they will barely give you shampoo .
am i lucky or is it a standard in the scrambled eggs !
would n't go back to this hotel .
well they must 've missed my room !
greeted by a rude and aggressive guy at the front desk .
no coffee in the lobby after 9am ?
i 'm staying here for _num_ weeks for work .
i was looking at a urine stain on the comforter .
long story short we are in a new room after _num_ am .
my husband lost sleep , and i am appalled !
so we 're in room _num_ now , we were in room _num_ .
this is appalling , seriously !
what 's worse than broken equipment at the gym ?
the lobby has a little smell but our room was horrible !
the guy at the desk just said its a problem with the hotel .
they were unable to move us or do anything about the odor .
the breakfast was n't very good .
the `` hot water '' for tea was coffee .
the towels also had a sewage smell .
this was the worst experience i 've ever had using marriott .
clearly , the quality of our stay was not priority .
it will not be worth the $ _num_ spent for two nights of horror .
the whole trip was a mistake .
she said there was nothing she could do .
not to mention , you never checked for id or paperwork later .
no parking lot cameras , no security .
do not stay here .
we left & stayed @ another hotel .
the hotel is in desperate need of new carpeting , it is disgusting .
come on this ai n't no place for dine and dash .
i felt horrible in front of all those people .
the lack of understand and empathy for a customer was very shocking here .
warning warning warning warning ... .
the worst experience i have ever had .
are you fucking kidding me ?
since there were two , i just chose not to use that one .
the id numbers were literally one number off .
only after showing that photo , the employee allowed me to take my luggage .
the hotel did not step up to do anything .
it 's difficult to remember all the things that were horrible about this hotel .
the housekeeping was also terrible .
i also found hair all over the toilet , which is a little disgusting .
finally , this hotel is really poorly located .
the taxi to the strip cost almost $ _num_ .
worst hotel in vegas !
this is the worst banana republic that i 've ever been too .
but you understand '' and walked away while i was still talking to her .
i will never shop at banana again , one store ruined it all .
had a terrible experience at this store .
awful customer service .
then she told me the item was not on sale .
worst customer service experience ever .
kinda weird u have to ring a door bell to enter .
thumbs down the business owner should update the info with yelp !
reservations were made for _num_ rooms .
i have never been so disappointed there were so many things that were wrong .
my son checked in first with me wednesday the 25th .
i ca n't even express how bad that was .
later that night , due to a leak they had to be moved .
we also paid your resort fees .
the pool is closed , we paid extra for the secret garden .
i sent an email to their customer care team .
if we stay there again she will personally make sure everything runs smoothly .
i rather go to the outlets in vegas and find cheaper items .
the service here sucks .
no greeting .
their behavior was grossly inappropriate , highly unprofessional .
i walked away after staring at the watch for some minute or two .
i presented my clothes to her , she said nothing .
i am sorry i bothered you , i thought .
you all have trouble even closing on a t shirt .
and then , i tried to find her and found .
she was talking and laughing with other employees .
as far as the iphone is concerned , i think i can wait .
its not quite worth it yet for me .
worst customer service ever !
i 'm thinking , `` no big deal , it 's a battery . ''
i 'm standing right there in the store and they turn me away .
tuesday came and went without a call , so did wednesday .
i do n't have a problem with apple .
really , i have no problem with the company that is apple .
disclaimer : i 've been a huge apple fan years before apple was cool .
he could find a prior ipad purchase , but no airport .
from the beginning , this young man gave us attitude .
all the time he was dismissive and kept looking past us .
we searched through her email accounts and still no receipt .
and he turned and walked away .
las vegas fashion show mall was my one sour apple experience .
i do n't even know what 's going on half of the time .
my least favorite experience was trying to get an iphone _num_ with them .
the whole experience was miserable .
like _num_ hours fast .
wait to be acknowledged .
i got there on time , but absolutely no employee would look at me .
he told me , `` electronics are just like that . ''
i am never buying another apple product again ! ''
first of all , why did n't he try that in the first place ?
i stopped in because my iphone was not working .
my model was not in stock .
they do n't care about helping you .
i 've been here for _num_ hours and counting .
i 'm giving them _num_ star .
the wait here is ridiculous !
ok , rant complete .
no i guess i did n't .
we were really irritated by that comment .
never going back to apple .
because it was past warranty they would not replace it .
not the store itself but the main customer service is terrible .
so i drove there again for nothing !
i swear the incompetence of the employees from apple is ridiculous .
i 'm tired of apples abysmal customer service .
tim cook you might want to pay attention .
this store is no exception .
i tried to make an appointment but there were nine for days .
it is almost _num_ years old .
_num_ days later i still have n't heard from them .
she proceeds to wish me a good day and hang up on me .
worst experience ever .
third apple store in two days .
not impressed with the customer service .
should n't u have scheduled less appointments if that was the case .
will never return to this location .
town square , summerlin and forum shops will get my business from here on .
totally ignorant .
not the best of apple locations ... .
awful service at apple store in fashion mall .
lost photos , notes , and other content .
but , overall , it was n't really that bad '' .
circus circus is half ghetto , half trailer park and _num_ % hell .
not anymore .
after all , mom and dad have money to lose .
but this is ridiculous .
otherwise , it 's a seriously dismal place .
i did n't stay too long after winning the $ _num_ .
poor thing .
it 's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts .
( ok , maybe then . )
there 's a reason why they 're cheap .
as your attorney , i advise you to take mr. duke 's advice .
so nasty ... do not eat at the buffet here !
circus circus sucked .
really bad .
it is very dumpy and `` all used up '' .
the rude service at the hotel desk .
the beds were very uncomfortable ( the floor was more comfortable ! )
our non-smoking room smelled like stale smoke , worse than the hallways .
clowns .
thankfully none in the hotel room .
it 's a $ _num_ cab ride to the bellagio !
the shops suck and the restaurants were just mediocre .
they have a really disgusting buffet !
what the hell was i thinking ?
this place was awesome when i was a kid but not its trash .
but the last time i went to cc ... ... damn !
wrong .
even the kids were disgusted .
what a complete waste of space .
night two at circus circus things went from bad to worse .
- that late night drive across the desert .
- $ _num_ blackjack tables .
leave your kids at the theme park while you go gamble .
ok , not a bad idea .
not much action going on there .
the tables were n't even full .
ugh .
i 'm seriously never staying in a two star hotel again after this experience .
one of the worst hotels on the strip !
the shower head was clogged , too .
it 's no surprise that the rooms are tucked away from the casino itself .
worst casino on the strip in my opinion , worst buffet as well .
otherwise , do n't bother staying here .
do not play blackjack here .
i ca n't believe anyone winning here .
i was sitting next to a couple of guys who had no clue .
my first visit to vegas , i stayed here with the then bf .
too many freaking kids .
waited in line for almost an hour to check in at 3pm .
needless to say , i did n't use that coffee table .
whats worse than the crappy room is their crappy restaurants .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
but like i said , i knew not to expect much .
the buffet was disgusting , like worse than my college cafeteria .
it 's gross .
even motel _num_ would probably charge you more .
they look really sketchy .
when i walked in , my room reeked of cigarette smoke .
you 've found the only slot machines in vegas that never pay .
why 'd i still go ahead and book my reservation ?
we booked a room for saturday night .
this place is just all kinds of bad !
are you kidding me ?
just really sketchy .
ugh , this place .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i dont think this hotel has been cleaned since the late _num_ 's .
well , it 's cheap and you can park an rv here .
this place was better but not by much .
the mattress just about ruined everything for me .
would not stay there again .
if you hate clowns , circus circus is not for you !
[ _num_ ] even by casino standards .
the steak place across from the buffet is delicious .
tacky , tacky deco , if you can even call it that .
its cheap , convenient to the strip .
not a fave of mine .
poor circus circus .
not my ideal hotel by far .
but it was cheap and you definitely do get what you pay for .
i do n't like kids so i was n't happy about that either .
tacky as hell !
but it was a place to lay my head and it was n't dirty .
the shower also had zero water pressure .
the buffet was disgusting .
seriously , gross .
the clowns on the walls scared the freakin crap out of me !
= ( i hate clowns ... .
club ?
we should have at least gotten a discount for putting up with that !
plus , the bath drain would get clogged and fill up during a shower .
also , you have to pay for internet here , which is the pits .
that 's ridiculous !
also , the buffet here is rockin ' , in my opinion .
circus circus is not worth it .
though i know it could have been a lot worse .
at circus circus for a bite .
it 's shocking pink !
lame lame .
it 's historic & i guess it makes money .
my advice is to get totally piss drunk and then go to your room .
built in _num_ , i am amazed that it is still standing .
even at the time , it was considered tacky .
i ca n't say it has improved much over the years .
i have looked high and low for one of these for years .
ehh ... circus circus is ok .
this place sucked big time .
really disappointed i did n't choose the luxor .
the restaurants here all sucked .
the layout of the place also thoroughly sucks .
what i particularly enjoyed about the staff was that they never gave me shampoo .
$ _num_ for stuff that was supposed to be included .
that $ _num_ was their `` tip '' .
other than that , this place sucked .
dont let your kids stand near gaming areas for long time .
i will not stay here next time .
i do n't like this place but i do n't hate it .
bad mistake .
you 're wrong !
blow this place up !
the casino looks and feels like it has not been wiped down for decades .
it is just too far from the real strip where all the fun is .
this is too kid friendly for me .
i would n't come here , except for the games .
really disappointed with circus circus .
the circus shows were n't even close to what they used to be .
$ _num_ - you get what you pay for .
as i walked in i couldnt believe my eyes .
the casino is completely outdated , dirty , and just looked like something sad .
if you have never been you should at least pass by the casino .
i 'm not trying to sound racist , but really ... what the hell ?
walking around past the casino and around the whole hotel really is n't fun .
salad was okay though .
every restaurant in there was so expensive , and definitely not worth it .
overall , this place is a roach motel for clowns .
this place is a dump , and i mean dump .
so , we stayed one night and left the next morning .
the staff is horrid and have bad attitudes .
which is supposedly their modern tower .
not even an upgraded room was given to us .
_num_ ) crowded .
too crowded .
it took too long to park even !
i have been to vegas twice in the last _num_ days for trade show .
the above list may not be comprehensive .
tax $ _num_ !
i tried to sleep on my pillows even !
my car was safe and i felt safe walking around outside .
_num_ good reasons to not stay at this hotel .
not to mention cigarette holes and other random stains on the blankets and sheets .
i can only imagine what the low end rooms are like .
not worth the $ _num_ price of admission .
granted it 's only a $ _num_ , but really ?
a total insult after everything else we had gone through .
as bad as it gets .
crowds , worn out rooms , poor service .
the tower rooms are newly remodeled and not all that bad .
the hotel actually gets _num_ stars there .
it 's hard to get anywhere easily in this hotel .
they are $ _num_ for adults and $ _num_ for kids .
: ( -- - crappy cheap !
i would give this a zero if it was possible .
service was terrible except housekeeping probably the only part we enjoyed which was sad .
the staff at their restaurants are clueless when it comes to gift cards .
they need to remodel the casino , is so outdated .
_num_ stars for kids tho !
now , it is looks so run down .
she tries for kenny , but could n't get it .
gross : everything was just dirty , or looked dirty .
the most uncomfortable i have ever slept in .
so much smoke , and sooooo many lights .
blackjack is cheaper at the sahara , and the casino is nicer .
the atmosphere is so depressing , as other yelpers have pointed out .
maybe even less .
i did not stay here .
one word : disgusting .
ok , two words : disgusting and creepy .
the table gaming area was named the money pit .
yeah , that makes me want to drop some money here .
had they lost all sense of smell ?
what that reason is , i do n't want to find out .
get me out of here .
and im not kidding .
i missed a meal being hungover and lazy .
i seriously ate there like _num_ times .
now when you gain _num_ pounds , do n't blame me .
no clubs .
it 's just kinda weak .
and those people who attack you as you walk by .
you 're better off at stratosphere for the same price .
omg , this place is a dump from head to toe .
seriously , you could n't pay me $ _num_ a night to stay here .
but we would never make that same mistake again .
seriously -- do n't stay here .
the front entrance starts things off by looking tired and depressing .
the inside is dingy and dark and just looks downright dated .
stayed here one night , i 'll probably never do it again .
i paid _num_ bucks i think , so i was n't expecting much .
was n't too smoky either .
after driving for _num_ hours , rest and quiet was all i wanted .
then a confusing elevator set up .
and they are so uncomfortable .
it truly ruined my first two nights in las vegas .
so if you do n't have children , please consider staying somewhere else .
i would have given this place no stars had it not been so cheap .
i only went here because weekend rates are ridiculous .
so try disneyland , parents .
but my journey there would not be easy .
did n't know what they wanted when they grabbed us at first .
i just want a nap , so i get under the covers .
ugh .
the waaaay too soft pillows that provided no support .
however , my boyfriend of the sensitive back felt every spring .
but again , _num_ bucks a night .
never staying here again if i can help it .
cheap hotel and casino .
but there 's nothing special about this place .
one thing i did n't like was that the walls were pretty thin .
nope , did n't win anything .
this place is a piece of crap .
this was annoying ( but i suppose it made it quieter ) .
there is a $ _num_ additional hotel fee upon check-in .
this includes pool access , the fitness room , etc .
the casino itself is pretty bad and noisy -- no high class establishment here .
very weird !
this kept all our booze nice and cold .
bottom line : will not stay here again .
this casino may be on the strip , but not really .
this was my first experience of vegas as a child .
i remember back then i would have given this place _num_ stars !
in the end , the experience could have been better .
but that does n't mean i would n't ever go back .
unless , you write a yelp review about it .
i am sorry circus circus , you used to be my favorite place .
by saturday the parking and crowds were insane .
room service is only 6am to noon .
no coffee or fridge in room .
circus circus is now a freak show .
parking garage _num_ is the the worst .
there was like _num_ people waiting for a small elevator .
when you walk in , its like spam .
i am not sure if mgm resorts are paying attention to this place .
the pool , all the restaurants , the hallways , etc .
oh god , this place .
there never seems to be anything new .
it 's not .
it 's a shame really .
recently stayed here in summer _num_ .
haha but that was our fault .
absolutely the worst place you can stay in vegas .
after checking in we go drop off our bags and hit the buffet .
the buffet was overpriced and disappointing with very little variety and extremely poor quality .
during my stay i had some of my stuff stolen out of my room .
gross , gross gross .
will never step foot in this place again if i can help it .
stayed here in august .
the room was like staying in a motel _num_ .
i will never step foot in this place again .
gross !
gross place !
first off its suppose to be for kids .
second , the security is limited and very slow .
third , the place is very dirty and ghetto .
there are holes in the walls and everything is either sticky or gross .
forth , the food sucks .
the sides were also crap .
the bed was surprisingly comfy , but smelled slightly of cigarettes .
the midway was the typical circus circus midway , with the games and shows .
i was disappointed to see that the carousel bar was out of service .
for the price and how little we stayed in the rooms it was ok .
i will definitly try other places next time i 'm in town .
our room smelled like rotten feet .
we complained about these problems to no avail .
i hate this place .
this place needs to be ripped down .
it was n't worth standing there , we left the drinks and walked out .
this is really far down on the strip .
i would not let my kids hang out in there .
this was more like a nightmare .
it takes them _num_ minutes to send the security officer to open the door .
so we call again and _num_ min later they are still not there .
no pillows .
pillows took _num_ minutes to come .
no remote control for the tv .
i stayed in the manor section c and non-smoking !
i 'm lazy .
that would have sucked !
directions that lead us to no results since we got lost .
it 's pretty bad in there and almost creepy .
it did n't look all that great .
maybe they should just blow it up and build something else there .
do not come here if you are looking for a luxurious place to stay !
this is not the place for you if you wanted something luxurious .
nobody seemed to care .
the casino was n't the greatest around either .
if you wan na be party time , go buy drinks from the bar .
we flagged down waitresses and nobody knew who was in that section .
it was ridiculous .
the rooms and the grounds were generally unclean .
so in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms .
finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in .
our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator .
bad .
the sheets were not even close to being clean .
went back with my girlfriends recently and it was a terrible experience .
the casino is old and reeks of smoke .
i ca n't believe we paid for the cab ride to get here .
spare yourself ; avoid this place !
dingy , dark , and low ceilings with annoying kids running around everywhere .
rooms did n't have shower caps and could n't get hold of front desk .
but it was still about a _num_ min walk to encore .
forget about fear of clowns , if that 's your issue .
i wish that i had n't .
not good .
they were gracious enough to offer me late check-out for the inconvenience .
ugh .
i booked over the phone and they gave me the wrong room .
the other reviewers are not kidding .
i like kids , do n't get me wrong .
not when i 'm trying to get my drink on .
hell to the no .
why am i giving this place _num_ stars again ?
this place definitely fell off the train .
worst mistake ever .
two hours ; i 'm not kidding .
and i have stayed in $ _num_ a night hotels in downtown dallas .
the room was atrocious .
the wallpaper was peeling off in our room , bathroom and the hallways .
the casino or whatever was alright .
do n't expect great drink service no matter how much you tip .
or get really drunk and it wo n't matter where you stay .
i must tell that this is one of the worst hotels in las vegas .
it is old & worn out .
the bath towels smelled awful .
i will not come back to this hotel .
their restaurants are mcdonalds and krispy kreme if that tells you anything haha .
first on the list , vegas baby !
circus circus ... for the kids you are awesome .
the room , not bad .
nicer than some of the others i have stayed in but still .
shame on you !
decades ago , i booked low priced rooms here over the phone .
should i have been surprised when the room was n't available when i arrived ?
wandered all over reno .
oh this circus is lv ?
my bad !
the name of the place is circus circus , for crying out loud !
i mean , c'mon people !
that being said , the hotel is , in fact , terrible .
if i ever return to vegas , i will certainly not be staying here !
we had heard great things about this place .
seriously , just do n't .
there are probably _num_ kids to every adult here .
the rooms are disgusting .
worse than any motel i 've ever stayed at .
it was was my first experience and i double my money !
but you 've been warned , do not stay here .
the internet is extremely slow .
the remote control does not work .
_num_ . )
the line was about a _num_ people long on a tuesday night about 10pm .
_num_ . )
there is nothing at all i can say nice about this place .
the carpet was in need of a shampoo , too .
i brushed it off but she complained that it was something in the room .
check out was a disaster .
wrong .
wrong again .
so i was n't able to check out on time .
trashy !
we also considered playing a little blackjack because they had some cheap tables .
but at this point i felt like i needed a shower .
skip this place !
the room itself was also pretty bad .
las vegas has a long history of money , music , and entertainment .
it is a sight that just reeks of old and outdated .
what 's worse is the casino is usually only at about _num_ % capacity .
same boring walls with same boring interior .
it almost feels like you 're in a motel .
the place is a giant indoor carnival .
it is really a dinosaur casino compared to alot of others on the strip .
you are not missing anything .
i do n't know where to start with the circus circus .
my expectations were not met .
the room appears to have been renovated lately .
not anytime soon .
stay away from circus circus !
i could n't make it ten minutes each time i come .
i get it ... you get what you pay for ... but really ?
would not reccomend this place !
to top it off , the room was disgusting .
but a little cleanliness never hurt anyone .
this has to be the worst casino in vegas .
we quickly left .
additionally , the casino was extremely dirty .
for around the same price or a few extra dollars more ( ie .
being it was free , the show was alright .
by the look of the hotel i would n't plan on staying there .
my kids had nightmares .
the food in the restaurant was horrible .
not even the hot chocolate won the approval of my children .
this is the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in !
this place was terrible !
i stayed in the manor buildings .
it looked as if i was staying in the ghetto .
it 's not worth it !
well , vegas can be disappointing !
disgusting !
this is a _num_ star review .
_num_ clerks checking guests in and out , making the wait really painful .
clerk was cordial , but not overly friendly or informative .
_num_ stars .
lobby area : really dated , dark , and generally shabby looking .
it could use a coat of paint and new carpet .
room : we lucked out and stayed in the west tower .
they were really friendly and offered directions all over .
casino : old and dated .
the only casino we went into where we would always leave smelling like smoke .
_num_ star .
we did n't explore the midway or eat at any of the restaurants .
we will not be staying here ever again .
no thanks .
whoa , this place is so run down !
my boyfriend and i were in vegas and it was _num_ degrees outside .
circus circus is on the strip but really far north .
i really do n't think vegas is a place to take kids .
just my opinion , folks , which is what yelp is all about .
clowns scare me .
not super run down like others have said .
it was in the newer tower so that may be why .
first mistake was staying at circus circus hotel .
the first room we got the a/c did not work .
the room was worst than the first .
well lesson learn and money waste .
buffet was n't great either .
but like i said , i did n't spend much time here anyways .
so this place is out of control .
the service was absolutely horrible .
worst place ever !
with that said ... i will not stay at this hotel ever again .
i think this is the most ghetto casino in existence in las vegas !
our rooms were disgusting !
worst hotel i have ever been to .
the food is n't the best .
the room was weak .
there was no fridge or even coffee maker .
there was no free wi-fi .
make sure you find out where you 're staying .
do not stay at this place !
worst customer service in las vegas .
never stay in the north tower .
the rooms are old and smell like smoke .
slots are ultra tight and table games are hard to find .
kinda crappy but i would stay again on a budget .
did some one tell them to go as slow as possible ?
their is a stale taste in the air .
the rooms , poor without being dirty .
they are boring yes .
do i feel like i 'm in the _num_ 's yes .
but they are clean so i cant complain too much .
when i say traveled i mean traveled .
i felt like i had walked into an indoor fair grounds .
a visit to circus circus was enough for me .
admit it , you 're cheap .
cab ride from the airport was $ _num_ .
cab ride from planet hollywood was $ _num_ .
so , i got nothing .
you just do n't want to touch anything .
the place is in serious need of cleaning and renovation .
but this place did not feel ... safe i guess you could say .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
but it is cheap !
i checked the other bed , same thing .
i did n't bother checking it out though .
it 's gross .
but it 's cheap .
and the carpet was a little crunchy .
but for like $ _num_ for _num_ nights , i ca n't really complain .
the water was shut off a couple of times .
the tv reception was horrible .
it made me feel really uncomfortable .
but yeah , this place is going downhill and fast .
low and behold ... two days after i cancel it ... the charge posts .
ugh .
they 'll charge you no matter if you cancel .
the hotel staff failed to ensure safety .
the restaurant there is not worth paying for .
lots of food , but lack of taste .
the extra $ _num_ for a room could have made a difference .
i was pissed .
glass under desk that was not cleaned after calling and telling cleaning crew .
the hotel will give you that creepy feeling , too .
this is n't a resort .
cheap .
that will not last , though .
it 's cheap , but it 's too cheap .
ugh .
the casino was gross .
the hotel section was pretty bad too and the rooms decor was tacky .
kids were running around everywhere screaming at all hours of the night .
the food in the hotel is very mediocre .
also the people that work there are beyond idiots .
none of us felt safe walking to our rooms alone .
i could barely see out my window it was sooooo dirty !
the buffet is gross and expensive .
save your health and your money and do n't stay here !
please do n't stay in the manor if you can avoid it .
this end of the strip has really fallen off .
the rest is just empty abandoned space .
i could see where that might be helpful .
so many problems with this place , where to start .
most of the problems i could live with because of the price .
the problem i had was the type of people that low price attracts .
i felt like i walked into the 70s as well as an ash tray .
just stay away .
so we were n't surprised nor did we care to pay it .
we would have to venture into the strip or downtown for that .
the casino sections are amazingly boring and poorly lit .
circus circus is alright but i would n't go here often .
the food was bland and it just did n't satisfy me one bit .
stay away not even a motel _num_ could compare to this .
this place is terrible .
low class .
i would n't stay there .
i do n't know who would pay money to stay here .
then its another _num_ minute walk to encore and wynn .
very musty odor in the room .
i am not surprised if they even have bed bugs .
if there is negative or _num_ start then this hotel needs it badly .
the only reason we stayed there was because of the price .
even the employees at adventure dome seemed unhappy to be around guests .
the free wi-fi was horrible as well .
worst casino ever !
too many for that matter .
and it smelled like rotten sewer throughout .
very run down .
i will never stay or even visit this hotel again .
it 's just a horrible place .
gross !
how can everything taste like cream of wheat and bacon grease ?
casino was ok , but the hotel portion was n't up to par .
i hate all the smoking indoors .
could n't find any quality food at the hotel .
it was fun but a little boring .
the buffet was gross and the food was dry and hard to eat .
just go outside the hotel get your water for way cheaper .
forgettable .
was looking for something cheap to spend one more night in vegas .
_num_ $ for _num_ night .
can not beat that .
my room was better that expected , mostly clean .
i would not recommend eating or sleeping here .
the service was horrible !
me , my boyfriend , and _num_ brothers stayed in the manor .
our first room was not bad .
it smelled like someone just smoked in the room .
every time we would come back to our room ... it reeked .
it was horrible !
there was a odd smell and parking was weird .
wrong decision .
it 's really sad .
like , really sad .
however , it was not worth it to travel that far .
we ended up staying for a very short time .
overall : it 's sad and terrible and far away .
loud , dirty , unfriendly staff .
layout : horrible .
ambiance : this hotel appears severely outdated , sad and depressing .
cheap and basic are no longer good enough for las vegas hotels .
i am sitting in my circus circus room , afraid to sit on anything .
i checked under the sheets , big mistake , more gross yellow stains .
i will never stay here again and might be leaving tonight .
disgusting .
horrible !
depressing .
i was very disappointed .
the cleanliness of the room , i would say was below average .
the carpet in the hotel had an unpleasant smell .
however , i am not .
but the main hotel is a little dirty and the pool is so so .
i would not recommend going for the pool .
nothing to get excited about .
the rooms where very nice , but lacked some clean facilities .
this place is awful !
coach called front desk & security & nothing was done .
they deserve no stars !
everything there is nothing short of depressing .
i mean really , really depressing .
ok , its cheaper than average on the strip , but come on !
it literally stinks !
unfortunately , this hotel really shows its age .
but the urine stains on the toilet seat was dirty , smelly and disgusting .
the place is dirty due to the lazy staff .
the place seemed like it was just half ass cleaned .
the pool area was n't bad .
the carpets were worn and stained .
the wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls .
it looked like a motel room you see in horror movies !
we ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy .
so , lesson to be learned , these rooms are not nice rooms .
but it is cheap .
the beds , i will say , had clean sheets and were comfortable .
you 're getting an average deal , on _num_ star accommodations .
avoid .
circus circus is still using the carpet and decor from the _num_ 's !
but , the prices are _num_ !
this place is the worst !
it 's run down and just ghetto !
avoid staying here if you can .
the only reason we stayed here is because of the price .
however , the bathroom was clean and the beds are okay .
for me , this is the first and last .
place use to get a _num_ out of me when i was little .
this was honestly one of the most disgusting places i have been inside .
the hallways smelled of rotten old building .
i would absolutely never stay here again .
gross !
if they try to stick u in the `` manor '' its a dump .
this hotel totally killed our vegas trip .
it 's is absolutely depressing to go to this casino .
the entire establishment has a tired , desperate vibe .
the music is just a little too cheery , a little too loud .
wow , is there a negative _num_ star ?
seriously , the only accurate word to describe this place = ghetto !
ruin my night ?
i wish i could rate this place with less than one star .
walking in , i did n't even know where to check in .
is n't that something ?
no one here seems to be trained in the hospitality business .
circus games for the kids will burn a hole through ur wallet .
carpets in room hallway looks like it has n't be cleaned in _num_ years .
otherwise , go elsewhere for better clowns .
this was by far the worst .
was unable to do the express checkout .
zero customer service .
`` $ _num_ in promotions '' were useless .
long , long walk to the next hotel .
however , that 's about the end of anything remotely great that happened here .
the rest of the casino / hotel felt dirty , old and uncomfortable .
we could n't wait to get out the second we stepped in .
this place is dirt cheap , and that 's the joke .
you get plenty of dirt , cheap .
everything looks old and worn out and reeks of cigarette smoke .
on the plus side , it has a krispy kreme on the premises .
stay here if you have no standards .
the food is cheap because it 's poor quality and cold .
the place is worn out .
it 's an older hotel but has not been maintained properly .
quite frankly , i 'm glad we did n't .
the wait there was just as irritating .
but that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact .
this place is old , noisy , and run down .
too many clowns and cheesy carnival games and circus acts .
compared to other hotels this one is very old and dirty .
its like motel _num_ quality rooms .
avoid this place for everything other than the steakhouse .
do n't waste your money here .
when we arrived the hotel staff were unfriendly and uncaring about our needs .
our room was supposed to be a non-smoking room but obviously was n't .
they would not send a manager or security to our room .
the casino was old and depressing .
i could n't get out of here fast enough .
it 's musty .
do n't book cheap vacation here !
splurge for better tower .
checked into a room that was still being cleaned .
very poor service and service recovery .
not even the staff is especially nice .
they stand behind the counter and just looks bored .
despite the nice hotel room is not the hotel worth more than _num_ star .
rude cocktail servers more often than not .
`` , she says `` your gon na have to wait '' .
no alcohol in the comp drinks .
dirty and old ... obviously .
players card is different from all other mgm properties , ca n't combine points .
mgm needs to sell this place or remodel before it becomes a complete dump .
not a good place to stay .
hotel employees are not professional .
must not have been mine .
please do n't stay at this casino .
this place smell so bad you wo n't able to stand it .
the people that go there also smell just like that casino .
not here .
she never smiled , never really acknowledged anyone at the table .
it was very depressing .
the worst hotel experience in vegas that i have done .
needless to say my children were bed as it was not a good experience .
it needs hotel impossible to come and rescue it .
hey , do n't worry me trying to sleep , guys .
i was exhausted .
it was still better than circus circus .
however , i was wrong .
this place was just ok .
none of which i really had an interest in .
_num_ ) room service is at like 8am every morning !
the room was sanitary but so old and dingy .
the area is very questionable .
it is so loud you can not even talk to each other .
the desserts were all store pies and cakes and cookies it was really sad .
our kids had limited interest and were bored quickly .
no fridge , but not a make or break item .
( note adventure dome is on another floor and was not smokey .
maybe they had ventilation problems .
spend a little bit of money and clean up / face lift this place .
it 's truly depressing how run down this casino is .
funny how that wasnt mentioned from expedia .
not in the actual casino but across the street !
bad idea .
the casino is very old and needs a huge make over .
the breakfast buffet is not bad but for $ _num_ thats a big breakfast .
the walls are paper thin .
nothing was done .
management did not care or address any concerns .
worst hotel i 've ever stayed at .
i can get over the prices because , hey , it 's vegas .
but being good hosts , we return whenever friends or family visit vegas .
you get nothing . '
this place is run down and overpriced .
nasty !
its free just have to tip .
feels like there 's barely any air .
its an old hotel , really needs updating badly .
room _num_ .
the room is old and outdated .
no coffee maker , no fridge , no nothing .
beds are old , pillows are small only _num_ on each bed .
beware also the a/c is loud !
the restaurants and food are n't much better .
no starbucks in the hotel but there is a krispy kreme .
donuts were great the milk was bad i just dumped it .
the place was clean but not worth the price go elsewhere .
spend the extra money elsewhere to get something better i wish i did .
the only good thing about this place is adventure dome .
other than that , this probably is not the best place .
most likely will not be coming back here in the future .
restaurant was ok i guess , but that 's all i can say .
i purchased two nights at circus circus through vegas deals and was highly disappointed .
the ad also showed flat screen tv 's ... they were not .
not cool circus circus , not cool !
not going back .
do not recommend .
the hotel room was dingy which made it appear dirty .
i did not feel safe in this hotel at all !
there was a strange odor when you walked in from one entrance .
so if you with your girl then you may not enjoy the pool .
there really was n't much to the stay but a decent hotel bed .
the game area is just unorganized .
they were chatting away on the side .
could n't she just ask how many tickets the receipt was supposed to print ?
the gaming area did not look clean .
there were bottles and cans along the games and i was just not impressed .
we are taking our money elsewhere .
kids everywhere , outdated .
drove all the way from la for a convention show .
do not stay here .
the only plus was the sheets , they were nice .
none of these things is huge for me , but things add up .
i stayed here on a saturday night with my _num_ year old son .
i regret staying at the first place i came to .
not to mention numbers and buttons were scratched clean off .
to top things off , my room had a leak in the ceiling .
stupid employees , stupid employees everywhere .
old machines , old machines everywhere .
these arcade machines will make you lose money faster than the penny slots downstairs .
horrible !
saw a guy touching him self and staring at kids in pool area .
you know how some people `` take a break `` from their kids .
i almost wanted to shoot myself in the head .
the staff were rude .
the buffet was horrible !
it 's _num_ bucks a person and it tastes like shit !
you may not like it .
old and tired arcade .
circus acts are also beyond old and tired .
i stayed at way worse , and i 've stayed at way better .
if you 're a low frills type of person , go for it .
i stayed in the manor motor lodge during my recent stay .
the midway , at least , has been updated .
i really wish they would step up their game just a bit .
the rooms were not nice and the bathroom soap was not appealing !
the whole hotel feels like it has n't been cleaned in a long time .
this was absolutely the worst hotel experience in las vegas !
the hotel staffs were not helpful .
check in time is chaos !
no apology , no compensation .
to my surprise i find that there is no available wifi .
the real problem came with the paper thin walls .
really , someone else can hold the baby ?
this place is crap .
and the room smells like cigarette smoke .
the bathroom was the worst .
the pillow case stinks also .
the a/c unit was blowing stinky air so we ca n't use it .
people was drinking in the hallways and the lobby .
this place is ghetto stay away i warned you .
horrible room considering we paid over $ _num_ for the room .
room was old and ugly !
it 's my own fault for not understanding the room situation before i booked .
not to mention the walls an windows are paper thin .
if you think you 're getting sleep at cc think again .
the property is in tear down condition and no one is in the casino .
no educated person ( people with money ) would wear these .
why did i walk back into this place ?
the place is smoky and the crowd here is rough .
i 'm not coming back anytime soon .
very bad service and my friend got bed bugs bites .
this place is very poorly maintained .
wow , i dont even know where to start on this review .
almost everything about the circus circus experience was horrible .
rude , not helpful , mean ugh i could go on .
my son could n't breath and ended up very sick !
room service got our order wrong , the mexican restaurant got our order wrong .
do not i repeat do not stay here .
there are so many better options in vegas .
this hotel deserves no stars !
this being my first time in vegas i did n't know better .
however upon entering the lobby i just knew i was in for disappointment .
i could n't bare to spend a night there and left immediately .
the whole place is just dirty and trashy .
this place is gross .
the pizzeria is gross , the barista and bagel place are also gross .
i 'm sure it has n't had a carpet cleaning in decades .
it 's really not too much to ask .
figure out your gross hotel .
hotel , _num_ .
casino , _num_ .
by the time it gets to your floor they are already full .
never will i book to stay at this hotel with my family again .
the entire casino is not smoke free and the smoke just stays in place .
if you are having an off day do not step into this hotel .
disappointed .
not circus circus .
very bad hotel .
there is no ventilation in the rooms , everything is really old .
also , it 's in a bad part of vegas .
only reviewing the breakfast buffet .
$ _num_ per person , best deal on the strip .
they also have an assortment of pastries and fruits if you 're interested .
side note : this place actually feels like a circus .
they are all crying and screaming and throwing food everywhere .
seriously , the people that bring their children here should not be parents .
that is how i describe this place .
check-in sucks .
_num_ guest standing in line but _num_ employees working .
employees no smile on there face as if are forced to work .
i only stay at this place just because my _num_ small kids .
nothing good about this place .
no microwave and refrigerator .
wifi free but very slow .
also , another plus was the large variety of slot machines .
we last stayed here in early november and it was really mellow .
my husband and i stayed here for _num_ nights .
checking in was easy , staff was quick and courteous .
the benefit to staying there was our car was close for us to use .
however , you are not attached to the casino .
water was returned _num_ mins before we left .
smoke filled dump .
also the employees were the least friendly on the strip .
impossible to reccomend .
do yourself a favor and stay away from circus circus .
i made a reservation tonight for _num_ nights .
told me that if i did n't like i can go somewhere else .
i am not doing anymore business with all mgm resorts casinos .
anything less does n't deserve your business .
casino itself is dated , boring .
simply trying to get a damn copy of the bill .
no transfer to billing services .
yuck , worst hotel ever .
it cost me and my friends $ _num_ each which is insanely cheap .
so all in all i dont regret staying here .
if you have a little more to spend , get a better hotel .
it is a lil ' depressing in this place .
circus circus does not do these things ever .
hey , circus circus has to do with some part of their wedding .
the layout of the place is horrendous .
i 've been lost a few times .
and , you do n't wan na be lost here .
like i said , it 's creepy .
the ventilation is so bad .
the location of this place is really terrible .
not walking distance close , but close enough .
really , you could not pay me to stay here .
i stayed here for one night and it was awful .
the steaks were cheap and the kids were obnoxious .
it was the worst vegas experience ever .
there was a brown stain i could only hope was chocolate .
i am definitely not impressed or satisfied with my stay here at circus circus !
the room service and any service at that is just ridiculous .
the people here are rude and greedy .
the hotel was just gross .
i had to call room service everyday just to get towels and coffee .
oh , and there is a _num_ cup of coffee per day limit !
i 've stayed in motel _num_ 's that were better than this place !
my experience was terrible here !
i was at the rio the night before and that was amazing .
circus circus , you need to step up your game .
we stayed in the manor motor lodge .
the motor lodge smells terrible in the hallways .
we never stayed here before and it sounded lie a good hotel .
i do n't understand what happened to it but this place needs help desperately .
the ventilation in the rooms is pretty bad too .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
just checked in and i 'm already searching for another hotel to stay at .
it would have been better to stay at motel _num_ .
this place seems so shady !
but that 's just me ) .
even in the upgraded room the walls are thin .
rude !
do n't waste your money here !
gross !
the rooms were so old and smelled like smoke !
there are definitely better places to stay , but this was nice and cheap !
yes , it is cheap but it is not worth it .
the hotel is ghetto , sorry , no other word to describe it .
every time i step foot in this hotel i forget how old i am .
a couple of years ago i went to vegas with my california cousins .
let me start with this : i am not high maintenance .
but in vegas , i expect a little bit better .
circus circus was a big mistake , absolutely disgusting .
i felt like i was at a crappy motel .
awesome but lasts only a second .
but do n't stay the night here .
casino staff was nice though .
gross .
i stayed here one time and totally regret it .
and it is really cheap .
i stayed at circus circus as a last minute trip .
i do n't know why it 's not even part of the main hotel .
looking for the registration desk and stuff was annoying cause it was soo dark !
free parking !
never go back .
too crammed up & smokey .
glad i came here once , just to check it out .
_num_ ) the gift shops & restaurants are expensive .
_num_ ) the area around the hotel is super scary at night .
not worth the money i paid .
motel _num_ is cleaner and has better staff .
what a horrible mistake .
_num_ minutes later the luggage showed up .
were no more than full size .
the room smelled like piss !
the front desk does not care .
`` not sure what his problem was as the guest did nothing wrong .
another guest runs it over before i had a chance to grab it .
the bell boy just asked for his tip so he could leave !
it was so bad !
i was traveling with _num_ under _num_ !
i will never stay here again and i will write bad reviews everywhere .
fear not the management and the hotel do not give a shit !
plenty of other cheap hotels in vegas that are not this bad !
and _num_ a night is not a cheap hotel !
in certain rooms , you can smell smoke .
you could not pay me a progressive jackpot to stay here again .
buffet was gross , bugs on the food .
but i guess that 's what you get for the price .
find a better place to spend your money .
if i could give it _num_ stars , i would .
such a bad experience with this hotel .
i was wrong .
the elevators to get to the hotel entrance are disgusting .
they smell like urine , cigarettes and alcohol .
i mean it is even disgusting to touch those buttons .
such a a disappointment .
having other reps telling me what he said is not professional .
wont never stay here again .
they finally fixed the air , but the wait was horrible .
we will be staying at excalibur or somewhere else this place is disgusting .
not my favorite experience .
time wasted waiting for help .
the food was ok , portions were small .
go eat at ellis island brewery it 's great and cheap .
i had stayed at circus circus before and had low expectations to begin with .
however , this stay , we were n't even in the hotel !
disgusting !
another incident was four years ago and it was a nightmare in that hotel .
so we tried to make the best out of it anyways .
the shower was terrible and the plumbing was loud .
the walls are paper thin and you can hear everybody from up , down .
do not stay in the manor .
the customer service sucks .
horrible .
they do n't look at all as nice as the pictures online .
and it was almost impossible to find the front lobby for checkin .
they also now have rides but super loud in the dome .
however they do n't deliver in the room accommodations .
the carpet was horribly filthy .
it was like wow what a shit hole !
beware do not have the same horrible experience .
it has been renovated but never actually updated since the _num_ 's .
most are also outdated .
expecting a motel _num_ rather than a resort type room .
i would have to say that this casino , vegas terms , is embarrassing .
we have n't been to vegas since our wedding in _num_ .
vegas has changed a lot , but the hotel has not .
nasty !
if i could give it zero stars , i would .
the smell is awful .
but i could not get over how much the staff hates their jobs .
we got lost going to our room !
the food was not worth the price at all !
and the coffee maker in my room did n't work .
so glad it was one night .
so glad i will never go back !
avoid the manor lodge at any cost !
because it was friday , every hotel in las vegas was expensive .
still , it cost me _num_ dollars for one night .
the manor motor lodge is nothing but a motel .
the worst part is that the room is outdated .
we just checked out from circus circus .
the first time was much better .
the 2nd night we were here our air conditioner broke down at _num_ am .
not cool !
one of our beds were made , one was not .
we told a front desk person and she did n't even acknowledge our complaints .
we recently went to circus circus , and it was horrible .
tv sucked completely .
it was n't worth the trouble of trying to find a spot to watch .
otherwise , this would have gotten one star .
the place is old , smells and dingy .
gross !
otherwise it sucked .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
the beds were also not very soft and the sheets were kind of stiff .
i did n't catch the circus acts , which was a bummer .
they look like they wish they could be anywhere else , other than there .
or deal with some seriously disappointed kids with their flower prizes .
i believe it 's $ _num_ for an all day pass .
we pack our things quickly only to find it 's a false alarm .
also , the buffet is like hometown buffet but twice the price .
i would never bring my child here .
smelly , sketchy and very cheap .
however , if you 're in vegas with kids it 's a must visit .
that alone earned _num_ stars from me .
just wash your hands when you leave .
the casino is very smokey and dirty .
we had a smoke free room but it still smelled like smoke .
plumbing was awful .
upon entering the hotel , you get the familiar stench of cigarette smoke .
no ventilation like the newer hotels .
gross !
i did n't want to touch anything .
and why are kids these days so fat ?
omg where can i start ... ?
she gives me some excuse .
honey thats not my problem .
did n't know the correct steps to apply the `` gel '' polish .
at my regular salon it only takes _num_ minutes for a pedicure .
they say they take walk-ins ... but no one works there .
slow staff .
this place is unorganized and not kept up very well .
what a waste of time & money !
skip it .
it was old and gross .
badly .
place is smelly and bathroom was n't good .
the rooms are old and even did not have flat tv .
parking is freaking horrible .
it is a low class hotel casino .
if you have kids is ok place to stay .
we were very disappointed .
i was trying to plan a vacation , and stay here .
your service on the phone made it clear i ca n't stay here .
zero star if i could .
and to get out one elevator and through the casino your done .
once again horrible .
ok , so check this out .
this place was built into the _num_ 's and it shows .
the rooms are really cheap for a reason , they are old and basic .
this place attracts low end clientele and families with lots of kids .
if you are desperate , this place will do in a pinch .
but , avoid it if you can .
very little water pressure in the shower .
only _num_ towels .
no tv channels to speak of .
the casino and midway smelled horrible .
this place is run down and old and smells like mildew .
it 's cheap for a reason .
try a little harder circus circus .
the buffet food tastes like cardboard .
not worth it .
the wifi is only on selected levels and that 's just as slow nora .
this hotel made my experience in vegas terrible !
a salesperson named heidi cancelled my reservation without telling my party and i .
the worst customer service ever !
cheap rooms for cheap service .
pay an extra _num_ bucks for a better hotel .
the midway rides are limited , expensive , and disappointing .
not to mention , i 'd be afraid to walk anywhere from this hotel .
do n't waste your time .
total crap shoot .
room reservation receptionist rude and unprofessional .
not my favorite hotel on the strip , but inexpensive .
housekeeping is lacking .
( not saying i want new sheets but at least throw it together ) .
the internet sucks here .
clerks are rude !
hotel is dirty , dingy and _num_ years out of date .
this hotel is not for children !
potato chips were left on the chair .
i walk into my room and my room is filthy .
vacuumed the room or washed the bathroom .
this place is a scam .
one or two more guys would go a long way .
the entrance where the hotel registration was did n't have this problem .
ice machine on my floor was out of ice twice .
not cool .
clearly stated eggs , pancakes , sausage or bacon and toast .
wish there is an zero star rating !
first of all , it 's a tough hotel to navigate .
the elevator to get to my room was tucked behind the meeting rooms .
their buffet is terrible .
hotel needs to be updated .
the room was not very clean .
anyway , of course she could n't know what i do for a living .
absolute bummer .
so much for sleep . )
staying at this hotel made my stay in vegas absolutely miserable .
i never had thought that it would be so unpleasant .
the floors were very dirty .
turned the tv on only had like _num_ channels .
so i was wondering is still a everyday thing .
dirty , old , and run down .
only thing i 'll give it is the cheap pricing .
never again will i stay there .
the price and location were ok .
but the room 's walls are too thin .
if the walls were thicker i would n't be able to hear them .
very disappointment .
nothing to do with what they show online .
this place is worst than a cheap motel never coming back .
one of the worst experience i had in a casino .
almost all of them are chinese i do n't know that is the reason .
i had the worst experience at circus circus .
i checked into the hotel and checked out _num_ minutes later .
and now they have a $ _num_ hold on my credit card .
so please , do n't stay at circus circus .
i paid $ _num_ for this room and got no hot water .
very rude lady for testing my integrity .
if i paid $ _num_ i deserve a room with hot water .
getting a little bit old and nasty .
i 'm not sure what to say about this place .
it 's dirty , old , and smelly .
left a gross taste in my mouth .
the place is run down and really dirty .
so ya it 's cheap ... .
i spent little money , but lost some of my soul here .
first of all , this place is in a terrible location .
this is n't located on the new nor the old strip ... .
it 's just nowhere .
worst customer service ever .
i can not believe the way we were treated at this hotel .
i left it on for _num_ mins but still no hot water .
we were extremely irritated by her tone of voice and her attitude .
i can not believe the attitude the lady at the desk was giving us .
and if not , she should have sent maintenance us right away .
instead , we got an email about a survey about our stay .
other than that worst customer service ever for las vegas hotel .
i arrived on tuesday night for a _num_ night stay .
it was late ( approx .
it went very slow ... at least _num_ minutes until i reached an agent .
$ _num_ per night ( fyi ) .
he told me it was about a _num_ minute walk ... huh ?
i ca n't even begin to describe it .
it was disgusting ... gross .
i entered my room and was even more grossed out .
for this dump i paid $ _num_ a night ?
the lobby ... the casino ... it was all tired and sad looking .
stayed here three days over christmas _num_ .
the problems were non stop .
i was pissed .
nasty !
horrible !
a nightmare !
the parking lot is creepy .
the hotel has a terrible odor .
later on she will deny it .
i have no words to describe my feeling .
yes in the trash .
and omg i had to pay $ _num_ for resort fee ... .
the parking garage is cramped , outdated , and unorganized .
overall i would rate this _num_ / _num_ .
it was horrible !
it is harder to get the large prizes .
luckily , the adventure dome was a lot better .
though chaos was closed everything else was like how it usually was .
oh and the parking lot is creepy .
horrible experience .
_num_ stars at most .
no free wi-fi .
literally no show in the hotel .
paid a month and a half early through online reservation for sat .
feb _num_ , _num_ .
we did n't get it .
after that our tv does n't work until checkout the next day !
online for one night at this hell whole !
what a nightmare !
i could n't guess when the last time this place was actually cleaned .
of course , that was a lie , as the pool was closed .
and the manager rudely refused to refund my resort fee .
the tv in my room did n't work .
the phone in my room did n't work .
there was no hot water .
still , no refund .
the sheet on my bed had a gigantic rip in it .
not one person was helpful .
we stayed at circus circus on a friday night .
we got a room for about $ _num_ including the $ _num_ resort fee .
i did not want to be on the first floor .
but then again this is vegas so that 's to be expected .
the bathrooms are small and outdated .
the _num_ inch tube tv ( blank stare in _num_ ) did not work .
garbage .
just had to wait _num_ minutes for a very simple machine error .
there was a cocktail waitress who tried to help .
she got an off the clock attended .
she was _num_ to _num_ years of age with short curly hair .

sorry no one in this place knows anything about costumer service .
my business will no come back .
terrible job management .
worst fucking place ever .
do not play craps here .
they have no clue how to play .
complete waste of money and time .
i 'd rather sleep in a cab .
but send your suicide note via cell phone ; their wifi sucks ass .
i had no clue about the layout of the hotel of course .
we were not interested as we are unable to getaway for _num_ nights .
waste of our time to even listen to her garbage .
first impressions , really put me off .
i thought since it was vegas , maybe we do n't need all this .
i was promised a refund on our resort fee .
not received it yet .
but people here are very rude .
our room was musty and hot when we got there .
our non smoking room smelled like smoke constantly .
our tv did n't work right and the bath tub leaked water all night .
not terrible but not great .
vegas is not for kids .
i ate at pizzeria and service was bad as well as the food .
they gave us a room with very loud neighbors .
all she had to do was send me to the front desk .
i just do n't get it .
with this experience at this hotel i think i 'm not coming back ever .
somebody would have to pay me to set foot into circus circus again .
in the words of my _num_ year old it was `` kinda creepy . ''
this place is sorry .
the gym is laughable .
there 's just no more reason to have circus circus .
i didnt stay here but visited .
that was a mistake .
if i had children i would not want them in this place .
so i dont want to say too much negative stuff .
but if you dont like kids , dont go here .
cut and dry : you get what you pay for here .
was n't as kid friendly as i originally thought .
golden farther from strip but has shuttle .
_num_ star is too much .
to he horrible stink !
let alone the horrible service !
we checked out _num_ hours later .
make reservations six weeks before we arrived in vegas for the rv lot .
what a disappointment nothing but a big windy dirty dusty parking lot .
told manager way past pissed off for just a pizza .
price per night during the week was $ _num_ way too expensive .
i 've had better luck staying at a walmart .
coffee machine with no coffee pot , no extra rolls of toilet paper !
nasty .
worst hotel i stayed in years !
horrible customer service , horrible location and horrible experience .
this was the worst hotel experience ever .
the customer service was horrible .
for the price , this was the worst option .
would rather pay $ _num_ more than stay here again .
just left yesterday and joined yelp to warn others .
they claim they have k cup coffee , another lie .
i would n't return if the room was free !
i will not go back .
but for me , next time ill just find something better .
our neighbors were so loud we could hear everything they were saying .
in the morning , we realized we had some bed bug bites .
would not recommend and will not ever return .
they sucked .
there is more that i can say but i will not .
i will not be coming back any time soon .
worse hotel ever .
its not worth a single penny .
the rooms here are not clean and the sheets do not get changed .
we literally have a video of them yelling , what a ridiculous property .
horrible .
who has this crappy of service ?
not worth it unless you have children or are coming on a family vacation .
there 's children everywhere , for me it 's not at all pleasant .
honestly , do not waste your money here !
just unprofessional and over priced for what you get .
resort fee per night to cover things like wifi , etc .
overall , this place was better than the expected for the price we paid .
the staff were friendly in every encounter .
the bed was a little soft but it was not too bad .
the room was noisy .
overall this was not a bad place to stay .
with that said , run away from circus circus .
this casino is straight hood .
it 's like the bad , east side motel casino of the strip .
the room stunk it was not very comfortable .
the grocery store in your town you can no longer visit at night .
vegas should n't remind you of this .
but circus circus does .
seriously regret staying here .
location is n't good , old nasty , smelly , dirty !
we did not stay here so i ca n't comment on the room quality .
an old run down hotel that has a lot of wear and tear .
the circus acts were only a few minutes long but ok especially for children .
the manor is in another area not connected to the main hotel/casino .
why _num_ stars ?
also , i smell weed in the hall .
bad .
of course , complaining did n't help .
hmm , could their housekeeping department be biased ?
just a disgusting waste of money for poor quality and even worse customer service .
i have never in my life felt so nasty .
this hotel is disgusting .
the sheets where nasty and had old blood stains .
they upgraded us to a suite and comp 'd is _num_ breakfast buffett .
the room was nice and clean but a little dated .
_num_ star was for horrible service .
customer service sucks at the front desk .
the place smells like one , gigantic cigarette and appears filthy .
obviously , will never set foot in that hell hole again !
not having a sign saying you are out of certain items .
put a sign so we do n't wait in line .
_num_ ) why ca n't you pay with two credit cards for admission ?
_num_ ) need to expand that area , way to small .
not the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in , but it was close .
it smelled like cleaning agents , but felt dirty .
the beds are old and uncomfortable .
the bathrooms smell like you know what .
and everything just looked old and broken down .
the worst hotel on the strip .
do not stay here .
pay a bit more and go elsewhere !
this was the worst experience i have ever had las vegas .
2nd the room they gave us , the air conditioner was out .
our room was so hot i felt sick !
this has been the worst experience ever at circus circus !
my oh my where do i start ?
rule number one in business accommodate your paying guest .
circus circus is by far the worst hotel i have ever been to .
well , i was n't aware of that .
then i had to pay the $ _num_ resort fee .
i 'm not even in the resort .
all of which i checked into when i was _num_ with no problems .
at new york new york i was upgraded into the second nicest room available .
worst hotel ever .
i will not return and will warn friends and relatives about this place .
look around before booking a room here and save yourselves the trouble .
wo n't be going back here again .
this place is not worth the price .
i heard a lot of great things about this place and was highly disappointed .
the rides are outdated and the arcade games are extremely dirty .
it 's sad to see what has become of this place .
our family stayed at the circus circus for _num_ days in july .
i would not recommend you stay their .
we spent more time at another hotel , the hilton .
the restaurant is the only good thing going for circus circus .
first of all , the parking situation was awful .
the ceiling is low , the place smells awful , gambling sucked .
the steakhouse was not worth all this drama .
would never come back here unless i had my kids .
it really is a circus .
the west deli cafe was also awful .
if you 're hungry , go elsewhere .
she did n't even apologize for what happened .
its all that you can smell as you shower .
thats fine but it is way over crowded and gross .
we have a five and a _num_ yr old .
i felt sick , embarrassed , angry and disgusted .
this was the worst hotel i 've ever stayed at !
i really never experienced such poor customer service !
i 'll give one star just because i feel bad for them .
bathroom locks do n't work .
i walked in on a friend while she was on the toilet .
not a pleasant feeling knowing the bathroom locks do n't work .
my stay was thursday night through tuesday morning .
the desk clerk said its normal for it to make noise .
unfortunately this review can keep going but i think the idea is clear .
i ca n't stop laughing !
when we got into our room its dirty and smell like cigarette .
this hotel is the worst i have ever stayed at .
we visited it and turned right around and walked out .
this was a nightmare of a stay .
did n't hear anybody winning anything , nor did i , all day friday .
oh that 's how we do it , the hotel manager told me .
just does n't feel right anymore .
its luster is lacking .
not even to use the casino , or the bathroom .
they just about destroyed my _num_ year relationship with them without really caring .

not done tomorrow , or a week from now , but now .
am i alone in this world when giving my word ?
this is now my third time staying in las vegas .
the a/c unit looked like it was never cleaned .
the room location had no easy access to the strip .
the only light i can see are the staff there .
i would never let them put me here again .
it is far away from all the shops and coffee places .
it was obvious they do n't have a real disaster plan .
there was n't a cleaning crew or any activity .
it was _num_ degrees outside .
this hotel needs major upgrades .
would i stay here again , no not ever !
_num_ . )
they stopped smoking rooms the week i booked .
may as well have stayed elsewhere .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
finally it stopped , five minutes of quiet when boom !
terrible .
probably just some drunk fight by the slots .
the only up side was getting on the rides in adventure dome .
other than that , i will never be staying in circus circus again .
all i could say im very disgusted , disappointed and frustrating .
low and behold it was a bed bug !
there are cigarette burns on the sheets and it reeks of smoke !
i will not stay at circus circus again .
this had been a horrible experience .
i had it on the hottest it could go and water was cold .
i 'm so disgusted !
i prefer to give zero star on this hotel .
poor customer service .
in other words , they ruined my mini vacation .
the experience is something i will never forget .
tonight is my first night here and i 'm still very much upset .
we were placed in building b , ghetto looking motel style building .
the room itself looked ok at first glance .
none of the ice machines were properly working .
the swimming pool was extremely disgusting , way too overcrowded and just gross .
horrible customer service , wont stay in this hotel ever again .
i will not come back to this hotel even if i get paid .
the food there was overpriced and terrible !
it is just not worth it !
this place was horrible !
not to mention extremely unprofessional !
this place should be next on the list of hotels to knock down .
cab fare from the hotel sucks too .
i would n't recommend .
the room actually did n't look that bad .
i totally regret that .
shame on me for not doing more of my own homework .
i was there for a conference , and for some time away from life .
i spent more on cabs than i did on anything .
the walls in the rooms must be paper thin .
stinky , outdated and downright nasty .
later that night we find our bathroom sink and tub were clogged .
very rude .
they have a nasty attitude and take it out on all families .
do n't stay at this hotel .
pay a little more and stay somewhere with better customer care .
stayed here on a last minute vegas trip last weekend .
the room was just dirty and smelled like mold and body odor .
the beds were hard as a rock and killed my back .
the prices are cheap for a reason , the rooms were dirty and dated .
the drink server , an asian female , was rude and disrespectful .
she is there to provide customer service .
this server left us waiting _num_ minutes for a drink .
thanks for making bad memories one lousy service person at a time .
to be a gracious host while i spend my damn hard earned money .
so far , not so good .
no big deal !
eh is about all i can say for circus circus .
the casino could use a makeover .
they have newer machines , but everything else is just stale .
it also has the really old smoke smell about it .
it is just super crowded and cramped .
games that were $ _num_ are now $ _num_ a pop .
it was pretty empty as well , maybe its because its to expensive now .
the parking is chaotic .
horrible !
it was so bad last night i could taste it !
everything is so spread out , nothing is close .
here is my experience staying with circus circus on october _num_ , _num_ .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at !
even worse than a motel six or low budget hotel !
the room i stayed in was filthy !
would n't recommend this hotel to anyone .
cheap gambling .
have never actually stayed here , just visited .
the bedding was a bit stained and had some holes was not very soft .
the blow dryer burnt my hair and it fell off .
the room is very loud as walls are super thin .
i would prob not stay here again .
i would like to give _num_ star if there is such option .
after we got into our room , there 's no chair !
towels in the bathroom are not clean .
it was so long i had to call them again .
next morning , no hot water .
hell no !
we said no we have no cash and all of a sudden cash appeared .
we still do n't have our $ _num_ back and we are pissed .
only giving one star cause i think i had too .
avoid this hotel !
i had booked _num_ rooms with king size beds with hotels.com .
the worst part of the whole thing was security .
if i could give them half a star i would .
this was worst hotel i 've stayed in .
with no explanation !
the bathrooms were falling apart .
and there was no hot water .
horrible .
the next four days were worse .
and it would n't drain .
it smelled terrible and so did the whole room .
i 'm very disappointed with our stay .
i feel like we wasted our money .
every hallway in the hotel smells of smoke .
the room i 'm in smells , but not terribly .
this is n't a joke , seriously it 's bad .
ice machine on my floor does n't work .
a few of the buttons on the elevators do n't work .
it 's closed for repairs ... not one ride , the whole place .
monorail runs through the side of the building .
and not that hip trendy dated look .
circus circus is a sad joke .
they will just tell you they never received your email .
reserved a room here , checked in , saw the room , and left .
nope , nope , nope .
it 's a very filthy smelly old building .
can not get a drink to save your life .
called the pizzeria , refused to answer .
so frustrated .
there 's nothing to offer in it .
it was n't worth the price .
i ca n't even get the smell out of the stuff i bought .
the room was gross and the heater was blowing out cold air .
bottom line : older , dirty casino .
also , do n't expect any of the gaming to pay .
ventilation in the arcade sucks .
it was a horrible experience .
why do they let people smoke indoors anyways ?
they 're idiots .
overall , dirty hotel , incompetent staff and poor service .
this is the worst hotel ever .
i cant sleep .
im not going to come back .
the room was not clean ready for new guests .
_num_ min passed and no one showed up .
thats why i 'm giving it on star .
some of the things were dated and needed maintenance , which was a bummer .
the casino is n't as nice as other hotels .
there is a stench that has no equal .
i avoided spending too much time in the casino because of the smell .
the room was n't too bad .
there was n't a chair or fridge .
the room was n't terrible , but the smell is unbearable !
omg ... this place is so smoky and so busy .
i really really did not enjoy the couple of hours we were here .
i think it 's definitely my last time ever coming here .
however , this time around were placed in room _num_ .
ever .
otherwise , this hotel would get nothing .
whatever you do do n't stay in room _num_ .
do n't be fooled by the pictures online .
this place is so outdated , its unbelievable .
very , very trashy place with an odd smell .
i checked in and checked out literally _num_ minutes later .
avoid this place like the plague .
anyways we got our key card and proceeded upstairs to our non-smoking room .
we walked downstairs again and politely told the front desk what happened .
okay ... that 's a little outdated but sure .
tub does n't drain .
no outlets .
walmart hotel form sorta , except the employees seem to care .
overall i was disappointed .
circus circus , where should i start ?
as an adult those clowns just get even worse .
the rooms are old , and a bit musty .
the casino is small and not enjoyable .
that being said , the biggest problem with this hotel is location .
there are better family friendly spots , and there are better located cheap spots .
horrible horrible horrible !
we paid the extra money and went to palms instead .
no coffee maker , no microwave for a $ $ $ price .
this experience has been horrible !
do not stay here .
do not stay here you will regret it !
manor lodge hotel in circus circus was horrible !
will never go back nor recommend to anyone .
when my mom went to take a shower , the water did n't drain .
still no hot shower water !
do not get sucked in to the manor hotel !
but ... we could n't move anywhere else because everything was full .
shame on you circus circus !
ick !
ca n't say much for the rest .
maybe once in a decade or so often would n't hurt .
sad to say i spent $ _num_ and did n't win any prizes .
worst hotel stay in a very long time .
came back _num_ minutes later and were told the room was still not ready .
when we asked to speak with a supervisor she was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
ended up waiting over _num_ 1/2 hours .
horrible customer service , less than sub-par hotel .
place was good to sleep .
hallways on my floor had no visible signs for elevators .
the staff that i met were friendly .
but that was _num_ years ago .
the garden grill i think was the name i had seen on the sign .
truly the most unpleasant vegas experience i 've ever had .
my husband won almost _num_ dollars off _num_ dollars .
if i could give this hotel negative _num_ stars i would .
no compensation or hospitality was offered .
check in was great ... .
this is not circus circus .
i 'm glad all my stuff was still there .
the casino itself is small with only a few tables .
unbelievable .
i stayed at circus circus this past weekend .
my friends and i all tried contacting the hotel on repeated occasions .
loud and very hard to sleep .
i wo n't be staying here again .
wow was i wrong .
my memory failed me from days of long ago .
no disrespect to him , we just wanted more .
too much to ask for some odds and ends to toss in there ?
my only positive was the milk a the buffet was cold .
dang cold and delish .
now at home sick from room not staying same temp .
that was my big mistake .
i did n't know what `` the manor '' means .
it means stingy carpet throughout the building , which is very run down .
tl : dr ... do n't book `` the manor '' rooms .
they will ruin your vegas experience .
the outer security doors did n't seem to close all the way .
for $ _num_ it was fine for _num_ night , but it was depressing .
the entire hotel is just old looking and depressing in my opinion .
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed at .
very outdated smells like must and fresh paint .
we booked a _num_ king room and got _num_ queen beds .
this _num_ star ... is literally for the midway section and thats it .
but outside of that this place is a heart attack waiting to happen .
the reason this third time here was so bad was the smoke .
this hotel is just not worth it .
the manor lodge is a short sketchy walk from the main hotel .
there was more than one sign saying dead bolt doors .
the rooms are very outdated and smell like old wet laundry .
the staff was unfriendly and looked very unhappy .
at first glance the casino seems very dingy .
service at the front desk is unacceptable .
very outdated .
filthy carpet ... stains matched the curtains .
do n't ruin your vacation staying here .
we were put in the back _num_ .
cheapest room i could find .
the last time we were in las , we stayed at a competitors hotel .
a days inn would have felt more upscale .
_num_ pm .
the other one had a blonde that would n't acknowledge us .
tried slots .
again .
the casino is ridiculous i could spend hundreds and not hit a thing .
we stayed in the west tower & the room had been remodeled .
i hated walking through the casino .
the selections for drinks were not great ... but was not expecting much .
stay far away ... far , far away .
i 'm big on customer service and surprisingly circus circus in vegas was lacking .
hundreds of people everywhere and it was hard to find someone to help .
do n't stay here .
the entire place smells like smoke !
no point in getting a non smoking room .
staff was not friendly or welcoming .
the workers at the midway where the games are are so cold and rude .
they did n't even smile !
and the service was horrible !
i would n't even give a star if i had the option .
this was the worst room in las vegas !
worst experience ever !
upon reading the reviews , we were very hesitant on staying here .
very bad cigarette odor as well .
we checked in , and i immediately searched the room .
no bed bugs and no cockroaches .
very out dated furniture .
there was no hot water and the tub did n't even drain .
i would not recommend for anyone to stay here .
never again will i step foot in this less than desirable hotel .
checked in went to bed woke up with bites all over my body .
the rooms are terrible .
bad smells .
trash everywhere .
you ca n't open a window because there are no screens on window .
i felt so unsafe , the room was dirty and smelly .
the weather was perfect at least they could have their hot tub going !
their _num_ dollar rate was a waste of my money .
that is how bad of a stay we had .
because of this horrible hotel !
i stayed there for about _num_ nights .
god what should i do to get rid of the bed bugs !
the staff offered nothing for this inconvenience .
all the food is overpriced and complete tasteless crap .
cold french fries , dry sandwiches , tasteless salads and weak drinks .
you wo n't see me again .
i 'm very disappointed .
this place should not be in business .
shame on you .
no vent in bathroom .
window was only allowed to be open by an inch .
some weird screw was put on top .
not a place i 'll be returning .
the _num_ that were so great is the reason i gave _num_ stars .
old and rundown , nothing like what i remember .
there was someone else 's soap stuck to the wall .
so gross .
the arcade was overcrowded and restrooms were out of order .
total rip off .
i did not need extra visitors in the room .
the only thing i ask for is a clean room with no bed bugs .
my son , husband and i have nothing but bed bug bites .
never , will i return to this casino .
it sure was n't a pleasant stay .
stay away from room # _num_ .
thanks for nothing _num_ thumbs down .
low class operation and clientele .
the adventure dome was really just for kids and not worth the money .
guests have no priority in anything , especially parking .
they had country music concert and where charging $ _num_ for them too park .
they had many spots open for parking , that guest could n't use .
they only change $ _num_ a night and have an incredible room .
compared too $ _num_ for any room here .
only one star cause i could n't put negative _num_ .
i should ask for shawn , who was also very helpful .
props go out to them and all of the hard working valet .
for this i am giving _num_ stars to valet .
once again , thanks too valet .
this is the crap they emailed me .
once this report has been made , it will be sent to risk management .
nothing but a round around .
but i guess not .
i should have checked the reviews before staying in circus circus .
that was a missed clue .
i do not know how old the hotel is but it looks very old .
feel bad for the old people .
the path from the garage to the main lobby was nasty .
the main lobby was too small and dark .
it was very crowded with people seating in the floor with their luggage .
they could not handle the traffic .
the rooms were nothing special , they were old and outdated .
they also do not have any hd channels available .
you do not get perks as a hotel guest .
i am sorry but i can not recommend this hotel to anyone .
the room itself was not bad .
nothing special however .
the hotel itself is very dingy .
not updated at all .
the pizza restaurant was ok .
cheese tasted kind of low quality .
we had no clue there was even a manor lodge !
i wish there was a security presence .
i 'm only giving circus circus _num_ stars for two reasons .
now let me tell you why they do n't deserve the other _num_ stars .
my son and i stayed in manor a 2nd floor .
it 's not a blanket .
is n't that a hazard ?
the wallpaper is falling off the walls .
no gym .
overall they should be happy with the _num_ stars i gave .
circus circus is an inexpensive option close to the strip .
there is no fridge or microwave and it only offers basic television .
frankly , i felt unclean at times because of the overall room .
you see lots of low class guests walking around in the building .
the entire place was n't kept clean , either .
no clear directions were written in such huge garage areas .
their buffet has a very accurate average rating of _num_ stars on yelp .
it is ridiculously hot because the ac is n't working .
the toilet wo n't stop running .
the service has been horrible and rude .
if i could give negative stars i would .
will not be back here ever .
they also do n't give free play , not even $ _num_ .
it was insane how many there were .
this info was not on their website .
after experiencing the mexican grill we left for our hotel bathrooms .
do not stay here .
spend the extra $ _num_ per night and stay at excalibur or luxor .
poor room condition , rude staff , and extremely poor facilities .
i immediately called for room service and requested new bedding and pillows .
sit on the edge and sink .
came inside our room and i smell that people stayed were smokers .
i 'm so disappointed .
came inside our room and i smell that people stayed were smokers .
very noisy from the room above us .
circus circus was the only hotel in the area with availability .
boy did i regret this , and i 'll never come back here again !
the rooms in the manor behind the main resort are horrible and outdated .
there was mold visible in the room walls and the carpet was very dirty .
the tv was a very old box type tv .
the room was grossly overpriced for what it looked like and had in it .
i will not be staying at circus circus again .
they charge a $ _num_ resort fee per day .
we originally booked a room in the manor .
she wanted a refund from a vending machine that ate our money .
valet never available , horrible parking .
will never visit this place again .
this place is terrible .
old broken down elevators .
dude ... ok ... i will just say this , i 'm a local .
i just do n't like circus circus period .
i get that it 's cheap in all , but just no .
maybe because i was with the wrong people ... idk .
but it sucked .
sorry not sorry .
from start to finish our _num_ night stay here was absolutely horrible .
zero customer service skills .
i wish i had read the reviews before booking a room here .
it was all downhill after that .
i wish i could leave no stars at all !
worse place and customer service i have ever received .
so disappointed in the manner that this has been handled .
worse customer service ever !
the parking deck is so gross !
elevator is too tiny .
i would have been perfectly fine without even walking into this place .
never choose this hotel even its price looks like lower than some others .
we made police report at _num_ am .
hotel management told me it happened about _num_ months ago .
she said nothing like that had ever happened in the hotel .
hotel is outdated which is fine .
staff did n't seem to like their jobs .
reported to lobby desk restroom needed service .
stayed in west tower on 7th floor .
during peak times over _num_ minute wait for elevators .
higher floors ( _num_ and up ) did n't seem to have this problem .
the rest of the casino smelled of stale air and cigarette smoke .
no smile , no thank you , no apology for getting my order wrong .
we were placed in the manor located directly by the rv parking .
i will never be returning , one star was generous .
we booked at hotels.com where circus circus had _num_ stars and pretty good reviews .
everything you touch either feels sticky or stunk really bad .
first of all , our room was generally sub-par .
umm ... i have not been here since _num_ .
all i can say is that this place is total run down ghetto dump .
my experience at circus circus was awful .
unbelievable .
mgm resorts , _num_ % through with you .
this is a depressing environment as all you see is ghetto everywhere .
i would not stay here.
i know this because of the bubble bath i used the night before .
it had bath beads in it that were still lining the tub .
they should probably tear he whole thing down and start from scratch again .
you can get a better room for the same price elsewhere .
i stayed there for one week .
i called and complained and they said they would move us to another room .
he did n't even help us with our bags .
we got to the site and it was worse than our budget room .
the only difference was the beds were very far away from each other .
it still did n't have a light bulb by the way .
i originally booked a room online at the manor lodge and wow .
horrible room .
disgusting .
it was frustrating and they were so rude .
same room but much much better .
however , they kept charging weird fees on my card .
overall , i really do n't recommend this hotel .
all of which is indoors which is a major plus for summer time .
if the pools stayed open then i would say _num_ stars .
horrible stay .
saw _num_ inch bugs and some bed bugs too .
this is by far the worst hotel i 've ever come across .
the biggest biggest issue was the amount of staff vs the people checking in .
this is ridiculous , unprofessional and by far the worst hotel on the strip .
i should have stayed at a motel _num_ at this point .
pool closes at _num_ p.m .
could n't pay me .
i 'm staying at the hilton suites next door .
the elevators were full of trash and smelled like urine .
people -- do n't stay here .
if money is an issue , stay a little off the strip .
secondly there are stains everywhere in this place .
fyi .
the airport shuttle driver was rude .
do n't waste your time or money .
i get it is 4th of july and there 's a lot of people .
would she have thrown me out and my service dog ?
it 's not quite as i expected .
the shower curtain was dirty like it havent been change in years .
i have the worse experience staying at circus circus .
the customer service was mediocre as best .
the casino is crammed with the little thrift shops around every corner .
if your wanting to be around a ton of screaming kids .
i 'll scratch this casino off my list next visit !
im never coming here again .
service was slow and people were rude .
this will not be a place of choice for us .
we stood in front of the cashier for _num_ minutes , getting ignored .
then she proceeds to get upset with me because i 'm frustrated .
pay the extra cab fare and get away from this place !
chatting at the front desk for _num_ hours .
the parking lot has been near empty for the _num_ hours i have been .
and , they wo n't let the patient use their phone .
no communication or sharing of information .
i refuse bad service from companies .
unfortunate a simple question asking about the pharmacy could turn into a war game .
do n't believe your nightmare ends when you walk out the door .
they do n't even sit her up in a chair .
he is _num_ years old and suffering from his own health problems .
i ordered via _num_ hr food website that i 've used before .
bad customer service !
firstly , making an order is impossible with the guy that works here .
secondly the driver doesnt know how to get to my address .
dumb !
i wish there was a way to give no stars .
i ordered via _num_ hr food website that i 've used before .
bad customer service !
they told me it would be another _num_ minutes .
maybe it was an off night but i was seriously disappointed .
sitting down you feel taken care of .
the food selection is mediocre as well as what it actually tastes like .
nothing to jump out of your seats for .
no parties for your taste buds .
you wo n't remember any dish here as being _num_ stars .
the service here is terrible .
`` sir , we can have your shirt dry cleaned for you .
it 's a pity .
wish i could write a good review , but i ca n't .
nothing to write home about for sure !
the fish was all chopped up in little pieces and served with spaghetti .
it is just too bad the food does not match the service .
our waiter was stiff and made us feel very uncomfortable .
i would not go here again .
i had the ravioli and the boyfriend had fish that was overcooked .
they took away our bottle of wine before we had even finished it !
all in all , the service sucked .
the bill for _num_ people came to around $ _num_ .
considering everything , i would n't have paid more than $ _num_ .
take your money to a far more deserving restaurant !
worst restaurant i have ever eaten at in lv .
wow ... for once i wish yelp had a rating lower than one star .
this was about the last time i even remember being satisfied at this restaurant .
his reply was a dry `` we 'll do what we can '' .
it was a nice touch , but just too little too late .
i know no one from our party will ever be back .
so disappointed !
ordered oysters for an appetizer , which were very small and disappointing .
i could have made better at home .
expensive meal for no quality .
very disappointed , i will not ever be back .
it was nothing special .
their buffalo mozzarella appetizer ( really just a caprese ) was alright .
nothing there aside from the taste of beans .
everything else was just -- sub-par .
do n't bother with the pizzas .
food just is n't very memorable .
i went here for restaurant week .
overall i was disappointed and definitely expected more .
service was ok but the food was terrible .
for the price , and the other reviews , i was actually really disappointed .
the potatoes served with the salmon were soggy and hard at the same time .
such a shame .
overall , the service was terrible .
none of the food was worth the price .
i can not blame them for this .
however , this was unlike anything i have ever seen .
completely stupid in my opinion ... .
she gets through about _num_ people before leaving the table .
then the never ending wait begins for our main courses .
it is an expensive but it tastes like it .
the service was very poor .
that 's not how high end restaurants are meant to be run .
wine suggestions were exactly what we were looking for .
salad was very simple and plain with no `` wow '' factor .
this was highly suggested as the server stated the pasta was house made .
the noodles were tasteless and too thick .
the sauce was ground beef and tomatoes .
this restaurant reminds me of a stuffy , overpriced and overrated restaurants .
and to find out they are closing this sunday for good .
super crowded and it was _num_ pm .
it 's okay , no big deal just seat us somewhere else .
too close of quarters with the couples next to us .
looked unhappy to be there .
not a place i would recommend .
way too overrated .
this rating is for store employees and the store .
went here _num_ weeks ago while on vacation .
what , you could n't swing it as a cocktail waitress ?
but 2pm came and went and no surprise , but no one showed up .
i can not stand the way people do business these days .
so disappointed .
this was a horrible idea .
that 's why i asked him to trim them before the fill .
he flat out would n't do it .
worst salon ever !
just over all the worst .
try all means to avoid this shop .
the worst evil shop i ever visited .
this is very unprofessional .
once you want to purchase a $ _num_ shirt they 're nice though .
overall this was the most upsetting shopping experience i have ever had .
btw , the bathroom was filthy with a big hole in the ceiling wtf ?
he would not let me return an item for store credit ?
f you dude that 's so shady .
this is the most unprofessional establishment in las vegas .
both the sales reps and `` managers '' here are an absolute joke .
every time i 've gone in here , i 've been treated extremely rudely .
what a nightmare !
it 's a shame .
needless to say , i 'll never step foot in there again .
taking my money somewhere else !
this store does not deserve any stars !
someone finally came out within the next _num_ minutes and did apologize .
this happened to other customers several times , and to me , twice .
employees like him do absolutely no good for the company and their image .
yea sir i heard you !
is n't this part of your job ?
the sales girls are mean and rude .
forget that it 's expensive , it will make you sick !
terrible !
my friend and i split a pizza meal here and it was horrible .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
pasta was normal .
price was a total ripoff .
could n't even feed a toddler with that bowl of spaghetti .
working in retail does not make you a big shot , okay ?
very tacky !
i walked away with a really bad feeling and disappointment .
shoot , even a `` hello , good afternoon '' goes a long way .
i would know , because i work retail .
worst customer service ever .
i am a _num_ year old business owner living in las vegas .
however , they were very admit about following me very closely .
this is one of the worst sales reps i have ever encountered .
i was planning on buying a $ _num_ chanel bag from this store .
yeah do not buy lv from here .
their store reps and managers have absolutely no idea what they are doing .
he did not introduce himself to me .
horrible customer service .
horrible !
_num_ hours later , have n't gotten an email confirmation .
she did n't even bother asking for order # to check the status !
horrible !
horrible !
just horrible .
i looked in many stores and had no luck .
she had an attitude and the most disgusted look on her face .
so , if everything was great , why the _num_ stars ?
even the manager would n't even consider our request .
shoes are overpriced , even for the strip .
he was very unwelcoming and rude .
_num_ stars for her in store service .
a .
you can return your purchase for up to _num_ days from the purchase date .
received them , and in the original packaging ) .
i later found the exact same shoes at nordstrom for _num_ % off .
stay away from this unless you know what you 're doing .
i think it 's a reliable mean of transportation here .
i bought a _num_ bus ticket for $ _num_ .
the cost is far too much .
this thing was canned by everyone under the sun when it opened .
it sucks .
it 's expensive and most importantly - it does n't go anywhere cool !
the stations were difficult to find and get to from street level .
then again , it is vegas !
are you kidding me vegas ?
about a mile through bally 's to find the entrance .
$ _num_ compared with $ _num_ , what a ripoff !
oh and the bus comes once every _num_ minutes .
_num_ hours later ( not a joke ) we arrived at the wynn !
this is seriously the worst bargain in las vegas .
it 's expensive and does not take you where you want to go !
you would think that it would drop you off at the convention center .
horrible people work for the las vegas monorail .
however , horrible service = _num_ star .
driving stinks .
does n't sound bad , right ?
_num_ miles .
distance to walk all the way from luxor , _num_ miles .
you might as well have walked to begin with .
something of a waste .
um , $ _num_ a person for a one way ride ?
that 's two hands of black jack i could 've made money on !
not so easy .
why _num_ tickets ?
i purchased _num_ and only picked up one ticket .
i was n't drunk and i thought i was doing something wrong .
that was flawless and the reason it 's _num_ stars instead of _num_ .
price at stations is not stated on website .
their customer service lacks a little to be desired .
very defensive when i tried to discuss website issues .
the trains and stations are clean and the wait is usually not very long .
fail .
$ _num_ , one way , one trip !
there is no point .
and we have n't rode on it since .
if there are more than _num_ of you , do n't even consider .
nothing more than an excuse to force you through more casino floors .
not all of them have cars ) .
ugh .
dont take the monorail !
thats what the vegas monorail is like to me ... without being so funny .
if i have somewhere to go far away i drive my car .
i totally was not impressed with the whole experience .
sorry i just had to write on yelp to complain about the lv monorail .
i am giving poor marks for overall design and efficiency .
the cost of $ _num_ per person each way is far too expensive .
now had the monorail been built over las vegas blvd .
but a monorail to nowhere is just a plain waste of money .
the reality not so much .
the monorail in las vegas is a complete joke .
the monorail has broken down on more then one occasion .
the security staff , when you actually see them , are a joke .
trust me folks , save your money and take the bus on the strip .
this is an essentially useless transportation tool .
in that instance , just take a cab .
wrong !
ugh , its a ripoff .
wrong !
soo not worth it .
i would not waste my $ _num_ on this again !
to rub salt on the wound , this monorail goes nowhere .
do n't be fooled .
apparently , a one mile walk is `` near '' one of the stations .
do n't even bother with this disgrace of a system .
$ _num_ for _num_ days not worth it at all !
it would be almost better to walk .
probably not the best way to get around the strip .
however , it takes a distance walk to get to the monorail station .
been to vegas maybe _num_ times in recent years .
boring and slow .
terrible service !
then the walk through the casino to get to the station .
do n't waste your time or money on the monorail !
it 's overpriced and overall a bad value .
anyway , it 's not worth $ _num_ per ride to do it .
there was no way in hell i was walking all the way around .
dumb design . )
it does n't .
the monorail is a ripoff for tourist .
a _num_ % premium for being an out of town sucker .
i 've used the monorail in other cities , e.g .
in seattle , the terminal is located in the airport parking garage .
you pay $ _num_ and you ride _num_ miles to downtown seattle .
it was fast , convenient and cheap .
it probably would not be having the financial problems it has now .
not really useful to locals .
this really does n't work .
also terrible signage to get to the stations .
very rude , mean and obnoxious security guy .
seems to me that there may be an issue with the system .
i just said ok and paid for my purchases and walked out .
first off , they only carry hello kitty character items .
there are no other characters to be seen !
horrible cashier .
even with the cab fare , your lunch would still cost less .
no drinks , no deserts , no apps , nothing .
first off , the prices !
whatever it was , the total was a lot over $ _num_ .
it was reminiscent of packaged supermarket stuff .
really salty , yet bland .
just unacceptable .
i ate here on my birthday when we did a group trip to vegas .
we also had trouble getting refills on anything .
um , whoever recommended this place to you , lied .
fried rice was insanely salty .
and lastly the sweet and sour chicken was a failed try .
oh , i 'm sorry .
both tasted like the kind of cheap frozen appetizers you 'd buy at albertsons .
not the best way to start off our vacation .
the sushi rice was overcooked and too warm .
the drinks literally took _num_ minutes to get to our table as well .
service was really non-existent .
will not go back .
we ended up just getting sushi and what a mistake .
nothing special .
i was very disappointed with the service .
i will never eat here again due to the horrific service .
the service was friendly but not good .
both of our entrees were very bland and lacking much flavor .
i 'd be better off at panda express .
borderline not edible .
horrible sushi ... .
service was fine but will not be back !
not so friendly waitress ( sushi chef was nice ) .
this restaurant was , by far , the worst i have experienced .
there were _num_ of us .
once the server came , he did n't seem to know what to do .
no server ever came back to the table to ask if everything was okay .
my husband and i did n't order drinks , nor did another couple .
however , they brought the check on one ticket .
they split it into equals sets of _num_ .
one couple only had a salad , appetizer and tea for crying out loud !
after _num_ minutes , me and a friend left to go gamble .
unbelievable .
but , all they got was the run around .
ya do n't pay that much money for mediocre food .
nothing and i say nothing about that food was memorable .
the only thing about this place that is memorable , the bill .
tell me we did n't pay that much for that meal .
this place has terrible food !
service here was so bad i do n't even have words to describe it .
now the food , if you can call it that was horrible as well .
the seaweed salad was a joke .
but really though -- nothing else was special about this place .
i should have checked yelp before trying this place .
the low rating would have kept us away .
neither was very good .
with the sushi and two entrees our bill was over $ _num_ .
for the quality of the food the price was way too high .
the hostess was rude immediately upon coming into the restaurant .
_num_ at caesar 's palace .
avoid this place !
the mongolian beef , however , was way too saucy .
the service was n't that great .
$ _num_ for two entrees and soup .
dragon noodle co should be called only one kind of noodle co .
drank the liquid ( with lots of hot sauce ) and left the noodles .
my husband does not like sushi so he ordered chicken fried rice .
i order curry noodles and chicken chow mein and sushi .
i could barely taste the curry in my curry noodles .
my day chow mein was very bland but the sushi was okay !
what a waste of my $ $ .
chang 's down the street instead .
my friend 's vegetable fried rice was bland .
horrible service !
so-so service and so-so food .
terrible food and ridiculously overpriced !
you will be utterly disappointed .
go to noodle asia at venetian instead .
avoid at all cost ... got sick here .
so i asked for a side of brown rice and was charged $ _num_ .
when i went here for lunch , the dining room was nearly empty .
small portions for the price .
i had the shrimp kung pao lunch special and it was ok .
too many other better options in vegas .
i ordered one item , a soup item , total was $ _num_ .
only to find out they do n't have the same food .
the rest of the meal did n't get any better .
the service was very slow .
i asked for a cup of ice which i never received .
needless to say - we wo n't be going back to this restaurant again .
i do n't think rice is fresh made .
really disappointed .
i had high hopes for this restaurant , but was very disappointed .
the hot and sour soup was hot but not sour not well balanced .
the curry noodles was all noodles , very few veggies or meat .
oh and there is definately no dim sum .
it was bland and just not worth eating .
the service was extremely slow .
our drinks came out after our food , which is ridiculous .
we will remember the horrible experience here and never return .
my boyfriend and i were in vegas for a work function for his company .
the food was not good .
the service was horrible .
i ordered szechuan vegetables & tofu with noodles .
my girlfriends dish arrived before mine .
she stated it was bland and lacked any flavour .
no answer but `` i 'll check with the chef '' .
no szechuan , no sauce .
when i tried to get the server 's attention , again , impossible .
do n't waste your time here !
would n't eat there again .
we were finally seated , ordered drinks , appetizers and food .
the wontons were ok , nothing to write home about .
i ordered beef with broccoli , my husband the fried rice .
it was n't too long to wait for the food .
the beef with broccoli was not served with rice .
pretty bad from soup to noodles .
even the rice was disappointing .
this time was different though and i have to say i wont go back .
the chicken lettuce wraps were blah !
the tuna on our roll was mushy .
the only thing we enjoyed was the calamari .
i paid with my credit card and we left a cash tip .
i signed a receipt for $ _num_ .
when checking my bank statement today i noticed a charge for $ _num_ .
they have lost a valued customer in my family and i .
and a warning : i was contacted by corporate .
bad move !
tips are never guaranteed !
unless it is shown on the bill as when there is a large party .
ok , imagine panda express on a plate in a booth .
it was like chewing a rubber bands .
save yourself ... do n't go here .
the service is horrible .
there is zero flavor here .
there was no wait and the restaurant looked about half full .
the soups came out in somewhat quickly .
so it was like eating bones with some duck meat .
very little duck meat .
and this was the worst .
disappointing it was .
other than that i still tried to finish it all .
i 'm not sure i would come back though .
rushed !
soup was way too salty .
meal was just too expensive for what you 're getting .
i threw away leftovers after leaving .
did n't want to taste it again after all .
not worth the price .
our waiter was n't too good either .
worst dining experience on vegas strip ever !
very unpleasant experience and never go back again !
food not good .
gross !
the noodles were the worst .
you could n't taste anything but the sauce , it also tasted old .
one gal behind bar did n't acknowledge me .
the review was n't wrong about this place .
it 's a bit dry but still edible .
the walnut shrimp was gross .
the shrimp was overly salty and the batter was bland .
the sauce was n't even good .
i just ate _num_ shrimp and wanted to throw up because of the salt .
if you just ate it without rice it 'll be worst .
would highly not recommend the walnut shrimp .
i was pretty disappointed .
never order seafood in the desert because it 's imported .
one gal behind bar did n't acknowledge me .
really bad but super hungry and ate them .
it was bad .
i could n't eat it .
husband had vegetable fried rice and it was ok .
ugh .
absolutely nothing mentioning portion size .
still no drinks .
still no drinks and missing an order of rice for a person .
barely ate any of the entree because it 's super not great .
i ordered a pho noodle and i made my bad decision .
will not recommend dining here at all .
bad food and bad service .
i witnessed them microwave my beef and broccoli .
the pho was mediocre .
horrible waiters who complain about each other in front of patrons about their tips .
never been more disgusted by a vegas restaurant .
big mistake .
nothing but cooking oil flavor .
this place do n't even worth one star .
the food is ok , but the service was horrible !
when he bring out the food just throw it on our table , really ?
and they dare to charge _num_ % tips on our bill without notice you .
calamari was kinda fishy smelling , a little slimy , and rubbery .
i was just served a rotten piece of tuna sushi at this restaurant .
it was gross .
i should have known better then to eat sushi in las vegas .
i wish i could say i liked dragon noodle .
he apologized and said another server had gone home .
the sushi rolls were sloppy and the pieces were huge .
the philly roll tasted strange and i was informed it was smoked salmon .
the snapper was inedible and very tough .
i literally could n't bite through it .
service was slow .
sadly , not quite .
the kung pao was very bland only tasted like chili pepper and salt .
when it comes to eating chinese stick to p.f .
should have read the reviews beforehand , but did n't .
too bad .
$ _num_ meal for _num_ people , with only _num_ alcoholic beverages .
service was slow , and the restaurant was empty .
the asian tall female bartender with glasses was rude .
she had no energy .
no conversation .
no suggestions .
out of site , out of mind type of attitude !
prices are typical vegas for nothing special .
i was n't impressed at all with market city .
and my chicken pasta was quite dry .
it actually tasted like chalk .
first of all , it should never take _num_ minutes to get breakfast .
wan na know why ?
no one refilled our glasses of water .
all in all a horrible experience .
i rented a 2nd story apt for _num_ months .
it only took _num_ requests to get a newer one .
it didnt even need painted but it is required by law .
they tried charging us over $ 1,000 for stuff .
$ _num_ more for a crappy apt in a bad neighborhood ?
nothing was ever done to make this right .
no one ever had the carpets replaced , or even cleaned .
( _num_ ) there are laundry facilities that are always full and overpriced .
they do treat everyone equal , equally horrible .
extremely noisy here .
i find homeless people sleeping in the hallway on occasion .
they said they were raising the rent because they were getting an electric fence .
the management was terrible !
i 'm talking a months worth of no phone call back from anyone .
all i ever received from the front office was attitude and poor customer service .
do not sign a lease here .
gross !
this place is bad and just keeps getting worse .
how much maintenance does this place need day to day ?
neighbors are nightmares .
if there 's one person in the gym , it 's crowded .
building codes are way off but no one seems to care .
ca n't wait until my lease is up .
management does nothing about complaints .
and mail boxes are frequently broken into and robbed .
she just said she would get on it .
will never rent from them again .
i am so glad my lease will be over in june .
thus , nothing gets resolved and i 'm currently out $ _num_ for laundry .
there is so much noise at all hours .
it 's ridiculous .
spend a little more money and stay somewhere else .
this is almost the worst place in vegas to live .
they refused .
it 's so bad .
an bed bugs too .
all around horrible place to think of living .
not to mention all the homeless people walking around begging .
terrible place to live !
only high ratings on here are from employees .
the front office is exceptionally rude .
there is no real security .
the referring people for a discount on rent is also a lie .
probably because they have no intention of paying anyone .
the only good thing about this apartment complex is the location .
this place is garbage .
they were difficult and rude at times and lied on several occasions .
they claimed they would correct it and never would .
i am now literally scared for my life right now .
i 've been in a worse hotel in vegas .
so , it 's more like _num_ stars .
without a doubt the worst customer service experience i 've ever encountered .
this is not my complaint .
... and instead , they did none of these .
horrible customer service .
ugh .
needless to say , we hardly got any sleep .
never again .
this best western should be called crap western .
the people in here are just stupid !
am i suppose to just air dry myself and go downstairs ?
i ended up getting _num_ hand towels and wiped myself down .
i would n't stay here again ever !
but the respect level is not .
they may have _num_ local stations on the tv .
there is no overall security on the facility .
a little shady would n't you say ?
the area is sketchy and the hotel seems to lack security .
will i go back , i do n't think so .
not filthy , but not super clean , either .
the `` casino '' is a complete dump .
the pillows on the bed feel like a bag full of socks .
the room does n't smell too bad .
so , why did i stay here ?
because it was a business trip , and i really had no choice .
if i could give this place no stars i would .
negative stars even .
its a stink hole .
the service is not friendly at all .
first of all its not a `` hotel '' , its a motel .
the woman who answered the phone at the front desk was less than helpful .
worst hotel ever .
night _num_ : there was rain and the power went out in the hotel .
i ca n't believe they refused to refund us anything for such an inconvenience .
and the walls of this hotel are so thin .
they sent staff to clean up the mess and said it was clean .
the hotel staff i felt lacked training .
it 's not a hotel as they claim it to be .
maybe they got tired .
its a nightmare !
but they only mean if you 're in the lobby .
before this , i thought id stay here everytime i come for a week .
but its better just to stay at motel _num_ .
do we have the option for negative stars ?
because if we did , this place would get negative _num_ !
i booked this hotel through expedia .
i was greeted by woman with no customer service skills whatsoever .
finally she tells me that i have no reservation .
she became rude and plain did not car at all .
that was my mardi gras experience !
this hotel was one of the worst .
... breakfast was cold .
i 'm not a fan .
it was a place to sleep .
things i did not enjoy about it : their stupid shuttle system .
apparently this was a source of confusion for everyone .
it was not convenient for anyone .
do not eat there .
it will literally be the worst $ _num_ you ever spend .
please just walk down the road to mcdonald 's instead .
pros : room was decent .
checkout staff was alright .
tv had basic cable .
old falling apart building .
this a very old hotel that has n't jumped into the 20th century .
it looks old i swear it does not look like the picture !
false advertisement your better of staying in your car .
this hotel doesnt even deserve a star .
never again this hotel should be shut down its just taking up space !
even the stupid manager had an attitude !
ok this place does not even deserve a star !
first of all front office staff is rude and very disrespectful .
they all kind of just stand around and play on their phones .
very sloppy .
kind of creepy and very disrespectful .
the shuttle service was ridiculous because it only ran until _num_ .
sorry guys but this to me is a no go !
our room did n't have hot water for the four days we stayed .
we took cold showers back to back and it never got hot .
over half the electric outlets did n't work .
breakfast buffet was ok .
price was $ _num_ .
casino is a small cramped area with about a dozen slots .
best part of the hotel is the outdoor pool and hot tub area .
if you decide to stay , my bet is you will never return .
rude and unfriendly lady check in staff .
not even worth the $ _num_ .
my husband went cheap thinking that we would only be here about _num_ hours .
the bed was okay , very firm .
this place is terrible .
so bad we lied to get out of staying a second night .
room service cleaned our room and took sheets off the bed not replacing them .
fridge in room broken and stinks .
would give less than _num_ star if i could .
would not recommend and would not stay here again !
it takes over an hour to get towels to your room .
the sheets have holes in the them .
travis and the mardi gras need to work on their customer service skills .
sheets look about _num_ yrs old .
this hotel does not even deserve one star .
their service is terrible and very expensive too !
the clientele and people hanging around the hotel were seedy and suspicious .
the white stains all over the carpet in our room were disgusting .
the manager maggie was even worse .
terrible customer service and seedy clientele .
no ventilation .
had to wait about _num_ hours before my room was ready .
she went out of her way to make sure my stay was comfortable .
the elevator in the back needs to be serviced .
none of the ice machines were working .
i 've never seen anything like it .
lesson learned , you def get what you pay for .
this was my first trip to vegas and i stayed for a week .
for starters , do not pay full price for this place !
overall this place was n't too terrible but it def was n't nice .
i would absolutely not recommend this hotel to anyone , especially those with children .
there is no microwave , just a little fridge .
there are only a few channels on the tv , very limited .
if you are looking to get any sleep here , forget it .
i got very little , if any , sleep in this hotel .
the walls are thin , so i could hear everything .
on to the bad dingy towels , roaches everywhere yuck !
they were so irritating and annoying !
i wish they would be more considerate of people who like to sleep in .
my boyfriend 's family and i started our vacation at this dump .
if i could give this hotel a negative star , i would !
not this hotel .
oh and by the way , the front office , rude .
we get our bags head to the elevator and bam , elevator is broke .
i 'm glad i did n't at this place .
i got a couple of bottled waters for the trip .
_num_ days later , water is still frozen .
no microwave .
you got a big ass kitchen space with no microwave and no sink .
lots of seedy looking people who always seem to be hanging around the property .
tv channels were all fuzzy and only about _num_ of those .
no microwave or coffee maker , which seems standard to me .
did n't want housekeeping in our room at all .
if you want to check in early , it is a $ _num_ fee .
all on a credit card , no cash accepted .
i waited _num_ hours to finally have housekeeping change the sheets .
no vacuuming or taking away the small trash .
the wifi connection is terrible .
the laundry room is not clearly marked .
the bed was uncomfortable .
never have i had such a horrible experience at a hotel .
at that point , i turned to leave and opened the room door .
he then yelled at me `` you 're being unprofessional as a customer ! ''
he was pretty secure in his position to be so condescending and rude .
if you value your safety , stay away from the mardi gras hotel .
i booked my room through hotwire .
everything about the building was cheap in quality .
the carpet needed replacement , more than anything else .
the furniture could have been bought from a garage sale .
the gambling room was small .
we also did n't visit the pool or wash our clothes .
that being said i can only review what i did experience .
once we arrived i instantly got a motel _num_ feeling .
the elevator was old , hot and stuffy !
i think the worst nightmare would be getting stuck in there !
the room doors were always getting stuck .
the bathroom was seemingly white and clean but the towel rack was broken .
the furniture was old looking but you ca n't expect too much .
the worst of the worst was the bed .
it 's gross .
on our two queen size beds they put the smallest almost square pillows .
when we asked for more pillows we got attitude and a big fat no .
the breakfast offered in the morning was a hot mess .
warm milk left out to long .
she said he would fix our check then come right back .
it was way to frustrating for a free breakfast that was n't anything impressive .
no wifi , that is terrible !
the room is just as any other normal room as you can think .
i gave this hotel one star because there is not no star .
very disappointed .
other than that everything went smoothly .
this is a motel , not a hotel .
well this place is no good .
it 's just all bad .
this place is disgusting !
so have been staying here on visits for the last _num_ years .
no comment made on the rude snotty young man .
do n't believe the web site .
it is cheap .
warned by security where two women should park .
looking more than a little run down .
snotty clerk and no dam coffee .
will not be back .
too many places to stay .
when i first arrived i walk into the casino to check in .
she says she is completely out and i ca n't change my room .
the guy behind me says , `` so you are all sold out ? ''
so she lied to me so she did n't have to change my room .
i was frustrated and just took the single queen .
the room was charming , but the bed was awful .
it 's not worth saving the $ _num_ .
all i can say is roaches roaches roaches i will never stay here .
i would not stay here again .
the room i stayed in was reasonably clean , but everything was dated .
i wish i could have given this hotel a better rating .
this hotel is the worst i have ever been to .
this ca n't be a _num_ star , not even 1/2 star .
worst ... hotel ... ever .
but this was a nightmare .
no hot water .
that is a basic thing to have , not a luxury .
i am never letting my boyfriend book a hotel for us again .
first of all this hotel does n't even deserve _num_ star !
it should have _num_ stars !
this is the most disgusting hotel ever and do n't ever go there !
every room here is smoking room so it smells really bad !
internet does not work , food needs help .
the only good thing is the cheap drinks !
this is a no star hotel .
stayed here _num_ times , each time it was unpleasant to horrible .
carpet feels dirty ( keep your shoes on ) .
second time : given keys to room that was already occupied !
unacceptable .
replacement room sink drain was not hooked up .
shady and greedy .
spend $ _num_ more and go to a nicer place .
there are no amenities in your room only a refrigerator .
nothing else .
no coffee machine !
- internet is incredibly slow and hard to connect to .
even the towels have seen better days .
- restaurant , bar and lobby reeks of cigarette smoke .
what i got was the mardi gras .
i did not get any of these things .
they claim mardi gras has not responded to their calls .
the charge for all _num_ nights is still on my card .
for very little more money , you can do much better .
if i could i would give this place zero stars .
it is awful .
the lighting is terrible .
the bathtub did not drain .
the beds are okay but the sheets and bedding are old and uncomfortable .
the walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything outside .
i had to purchase ear plugs just to sleep .
the wifi is terrible .
so ridiculous .
she did not want to help at all .
i wish i would have read the yelp reviews beforehand .
there 's only about _num_ channels you are able to watch .
the pictures of the casino on here are very deceiving .
there 's only about _num_ slot machines in the casino area .
oh god how i wish i had checked yelp reviews prior to booking .
it was n't immaculate and after that first room we were n't expecting much .
_num_ ) doors open into the parking lot .
_num_ ) oh yeah cockroaches !
but hey it was cheap !
i did see roaches outside and was pretty disgusted .
i do n't really think i 'll be coming back to this hotel .
but for the price , i went for it .
more like zero stars .
terrible !
the waitress in the bar cafe at night is just rude .
sinks do n't drain .
( never complained about this one ) the toilet paper hurts to use .
blow dryer stops working after _num_ minutes .
it is not a hotel , it is a motel .
i for sure got numerous bed bug bites that night .
i counted _num_ bites and that is not an exaggeration .
the walls are paper thin .
but that 's not the worst of it .
i woke up to ants on my bed and on the counter .
disgusting .
will i ever stay stay here again never !
the worst place ever !
so none of my guests could n't take them home .
less flowers , worst quality of flowers .
otherwise , they will act like they forgot and rip you off .
well she showed up at 9:30 am .
she handed me the delivery slip to sign without showing me the item first .
then she literally started laughing at me .
this experience made a difficult time even harder than it was .
i placed my order nearly _num_ months in advance and relaxed .
they were not what i wanted but i really had no choice .
while the bouquet was pretty , it was absolutely not what i wanted .
overall my flowers were a big disappointment .
the only redeeming factor was that they delivered the bouquet on time .
terrible experience .
two weeks later still nothing .
so over a month still no quote .
when planning a wedding you do n't have time to waste .
worst floral shop ever .
so glad to finally be able to leave a yelp review .
they are the worst !
what a waste of time and money .
incredibly unprofessional and i 'm extremely disappointed .
the flowers died less than _num_ hours after picking them up .
first of all it 's impossible to make a reservation .
they just are too busy to answer the phone .
second , it 's very hard to find this place .
if i could give them no stars i would .
gross !
walked out right then and there .
the food always has a problem .
it 's either burnt or missing or not cooked enough etc .
this pizza takes like crap !
i order dominos all the time in la and never tasted something so nasty !
i ordered a chicken bacon pizza and it tasted like vomit .
i also ordered a pepperoni but i am afraid to try it .
i tried calling to complain and there was no answer .
this place needs a corporate visit because it gives dominos a bad name .
the address was put into the system so there really is no excuse .
they have lost us as customers for good .
i did n't get my order .
they were rude .
the pizza was `` ok '' at best which sucks because i love dominos .
the driver took _num_ minutes to deliver and we live _num_ minutes away .
the pizza could have been cooked better the cheese was melted like usual .
so maybe we wo n't be ordering from this store anymore .
all together service , delivery and satisfaction was a _num_ star rating .
extremely disappointed with the food .
wo n't be ordering from here again .
i just do n't get what people see in this place .
all that , a beer , and a margarita for $ _num_ .
none of these , to me , were particularly good .
the entree 's were a little better : cuban sandwich and margarita chicken .
the service was slow for a slow wednesday early evening dinner .
it watered the whole thing down .
you could probably buy them in bulk at costco .
it 's a chain restaurant , meaning not truly ethnic .
which in case you were not aware , is apparently in a bad neighborhood .
the service was so slow .
we were seated immediately and then ignored for like _num_ min .
it was okay , but definitely not worth the wait .
we talked to the manager and he did not seem to care .
moral of my story -- this place is no breeze .
this waiter did n't know much about what foods or sauces had flour .
what part of `` i ca n't eat flour do n't you understand ? ''
by the way , the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned .
so i did n't tip him .
the boyfriend ordered the pork tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes .
it was very dry and did n't have enough flavor .
there is just nothing special about it that draws me back .
the waiters that helped us were quite helpful and were prompt .
there food is just not my thing i guess .
go for the drinks and skip the food .
it was tasty but nothing to write home about .
it was a lunch portion though .
the waiter was ok , he had a little attitude .
chicken wings came out in _num_ minutes .
chorizo sliders were soggy , had to send them back .
if you 're looking for pre-made food this is your place .
everything is god awful .
i had the very bland fish tacos and my husband had the fried chicken .
but for us , that was where it ended .
the bartender could not make a most simple drink ?
the entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either .
over priced and the monday night bartender ( s ) needs a bit work .
he did give us _num_ comp drink tickets to use anytime .
terrible , awful experience at bahama breeze the other day .
no one complained , but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way .
our food came out quickly , but sans appetizer .
no biggie ... it happens ... except that she was not apologetic at all .
she said it like it was my fault that it happened .
however , this time it was barely lukewarm .
to me , that 's cold .
unacceptable service .
steer clear of this place - the service is sub-par .
there are much better places to dine in this city .
restaurant seemed mostly empty .
_num_ mins later i was seated .
service was friendly , but horrible .
the drinks were the best part of our experience .
the fish taco 's tasted like a sewer , but my cheeseburger was ok .
i definately would have preferred to sit closer to the center of the restaurant .
a few more drinks and we probably would n't have noticed .
unfortunately we were n't that saucy .
the server was friendly but not very attentive .
a manager approached every table but ours .
i probably wo n't return to this location .
_num_ $ lobster & shrimp linguine has no flavor .
onion rings are alright , just big and the onion had chewy skin .
manager placed me on hold for over _num_ minutes .
_num_ thumbs down !
the food is bland and really has no taste .
ill give them this , the beef empanadas and artichoke dip were pretty good .
service without a smile .
skip this experience you wo n't miss a thing .
no water , no silverware .
this place is kinda depressing .
they had live music but it was very drab .
i came here last week for lunch with _num_ of my co-workers .
so they take us to the table ; there are only _num_ seats .
i have no idea why they brought you out here .
we tell him no problem and sit us wherever there is room .
the caesar was barely dressed and was n't that good anyways .
now , i 've had the lobster quesadilla here before and it was gross .
so i thought chicken and fresh vegetables could n't be that bad .
well , it 's not good .
i do n't know how to put it .
however , its not the greatest on a warm day .
our server is a nice guy , but noticeably disinterested .
the appetizer tasted horrible .
ahi tuna should not have a heavy fish flavor .
it was clear that he was quite unhappy with this duty .
you can find the same quality at any subway or port of subs .
i got the chipotle beef rice bowl and my girlfriend got the fish tacos .
the rice bowl was horrible .
it was cheesy rice with beef smothered in barbecue sauce .
i did n't eat very much of it .
never came by to check if we needed more drinks .
only stayed for one round and appetizers .
food was pretty bland but cheap .
probably wo n't be back .
very disappointing !
no one even spoke to us during that entire time .
no excuse for this .
first let me say , that service here is hit or miss .
other times , horrible .
there is no in between .
usually it is busy .
but do n't waste your time .
messed up all drinks .
they tried to fix but to no avail .
i spent over $ _num_ .
for crap service .
really you guys ruined her birthday party .
you guys should be embarrassed .
they used a different bread that was way too thick and not even toasted .
the fries were just blah .
i 'm not too sure about this place .
but here 's what i am sure about .
cheap tasting stuff .
i ordered the fruit and chicken caribbean salad and it was ok .
_num_ stars for now .
same thing goes for the meals .
i had the fish tacos , terribly fishy .
while the food quality met our minimum expectation , cleanliness fell short .
gross .
it was a lot less busy but very understaffed .
to be fair - the food was not bad .
a few bites in , i bit into something hard .
well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing .
very disappointing .
very disappointing .
my first visit was mediocre .
i ordered the grilled chicken with cilantro cream .
so overall i would go back here but i do n't expect great good .
it 's is reasonably price but nothing special .
eh the place is alright nothing to exciting .
the only good thing was our server randy was amazing very knowledgeable .
bacon on a cheeseburger was almost raw .
ultimate margarita was not flavorful .
wish it could have been better .
food was pretty good , ca n't complain there .
also , that party room on the west side is always hot .
if not , then go elsewhere .
my husband got ice tea and it was horrible .
it tasted like old coffee .
service was horrible .
all bad .
all horrible .
my jerk chicken pasta had nothing jerk about it and also very bland .
so disappointed we spent $ _num_ there !
i was so disappointed with both the food and service !
i ordered grilled halibut with mango sauce .
wo n't be back .
the meal did not come with soup nor salad not even bread .
i did added a side lobster tail for an extra $ _num_ .
when our meal came the green beans were not cooked hardly at all .
our mash potatoes were warm but not hot .
the fish was good but not great and they forgot my side lobster tail .
i would have declined a free dessert but that would have been appropriate .
it came out in a reasonable time , but it tasted awful .
the bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved .
which i would like , but it was way too sweet .
i think olive garden could have made a better fish taco .
sorry bahama breeze , step it up !
food is great but customer service is terrible here .
the food was bland and lukewarm .
i got cajun meal and the only flavor was jalapeo .
even worse , my bf 's black bean burger had bacon on it !
they did n't even have the class to take it off the bill !
oh and no complimentary bday desert either .
going there was a huge mistake .
i find the food to be simply overrated .
this would be my first and last time to eat at this place .
the food did n't make the experience any better , lacked flavor and seasoning .
would be hard pressed to recommend it based on this experience .
utter disappointed with food .
the drinks were fine but the food is no caribbean or freshly made .
just tasted like frozen food .
never going to any of this chain restaurants again .
first time here around _num_ pm on a saturday .
maybe management should learn how to staff .
drinks were good .
wo n't be back .
huge disappointment for a place i really used to love .
worst service ever .
nasty nasty nasty .
this place is so lame !
why in the world ca n't you pay at the pump ?
i am not coming back here it 's not worth being a little cheaper .
you can not use a credit card at this place !
now , _num_ week later they are cracking .
i feel like she rushed through all of her clients .
i was n't happy with her service and she was n't very friendly .
walked in at 6:30pm .
male employee had just stepped outside to smoke a cigarette .
dancing too hard at the club .
there were _num_ people in the spa chairs being attended to .
customer service sucks .
maybe its because i 'm african american .
anyone else would 've gotten excellent service i 'm sure .
found a shop on las vegas blvd that fixed my toe for $ _num_ .
bad service .
this place is ok nothing special or amazing about it .
i 'm a good customer of this store .
i even offered to pay him $ _num_ for the bag .
this is the worst customer service ever .
wo n't be going back here .
yelpers led me wrong on this one !
the drinks are cheap and for those two it would have gotten four stars .
but , they get one star because of the food .
is strip pricing .
and it came out with costco vegetables !
for $ _num_ this is not what i would pay for .
maybe the brunch and lunch is great but , the dinner was not .
the experience i went through because it was not a great one .
having a cajun ribeye for the same price .
ugh .
overpriced so-so food , dingy and run down inside .
the wait staff was nice , but a bit too much .
not good .
go anywhere else !
i have to agree that this doctor has absolutely no bedside manner .
bad business practice in my opinion .
also her charge without insurance $ _num_ per visit she 's worth $ _num_ .
booked for 12:30 next day and left receiving email confirmation .
now i have a crying _num_ year old .
poor place of service and no help to accommodate us any other way .
dude , these people are rude .
there 's a weight limit on who can enjoy the flights .
so accommodate .
the facility is old and rundown .
not many selections .
not okay , especially when it is as busy as it was .
not worth the headache .
this _num_ star rating is only for the mac part of this macy 's .
if you have somewhere special to go to and you want your make-up done .
this macy 's , however , was awful .
the store was a mess and the layout was so bad !
yup , officially worst macy 's i 've ever experienced .
not a place i will return to !
but when i moved here to las vegas , i was so disappointed !
this is by far the worst macy 's i have been too .
when i went to the shoe department , the sales people are horrible !
i do n't even get a hello ?
i will no longer step foot into this particular macy 's .
i wo n't be back .
trash and water everywhere .
i realize this was partially my fault for not watching it more carefully .
we left empty handed , and wo n't shop at that store again .
how annoying .
the wait for the show was almost _num_ min .
by the time the rep returned we just wanted to leave .
please do better next time .
we left because it was not worth it to complain .
besides , the display shoes looked cheap and were expensive .
only had few customers on the floor and no staff except at the register !
eventually , i left the dress and gone !
ca n't believe it happened in vegas 's department store .
store is run down .
tile floors were filthy .
not impressed .
the worst customer service i 've ever had .
i wish i never would have set foot in this place .
the shoe section is total crap !
not cool .
so they said they would overnight ship another pair to my house .
i did not get welcomed or helped by an associate .
i do n't want to drive down there to find out they do n't .
no luck .
she said `` no , only a manager can approve that . ''
how rude is that ?
are you kidding me ?
i do n't know how she got that position .
is n't the whole point of retail to sell sell sell ?
it took me about _num_ mins to go through a few racks .
she really did n't want to deal with a customer she had bad attitude .
if you hate your job that bad quit .
i am a business owner and i would never treat my customers this way .
its not that hard ladies .
avoid this place .
i never had a great meal , but i never had a bad one .
i was very unhappy .
avoid giving birth here if you can help it .
my wife recently gave birth to our third child .
so , as far as we knew , the test was negative .
there was no consistency .
do n't believe their `` pay in full discount '' scam .
it was n't busy , he was just being blatantly rude .
they do n't want your business and they 'll never get mine again .
the bottles were a dollar cheaper than they were at my hotel mini bar .
two stars because the beer was cheap and really cold .
this place for a dive bar fell short for me .
the interior dcor was too light and bright for me .
the bartender did not strike up a conversation with any of us .
leaving this place a one beer stop .
ca n't say i wo n't be back .
but with plenty of other cheap drink dive bars near the strip .
this would not be my first choice .
seems quite .
not a nice location to be .
this is the absolute worst place to get your smog done .
the attendant said he has to charge pass or fail .
bad service .
attendant was rude .
could n't be bothered to do his job .
paid the $ _num_ , passed .
the other location was much , much better .
went in around lunchtime and there was a bit of a line .
_num_ for the chocolate chip cookies being delicious !
the girl taking our order asked probably _num_ times what our order was .
the onions were old the lettuce was old bread was old .
these people working in here could literally not care less .
lame , lame , lame !
why do you call it a cafe when there is no place to sit ?
the cookies at this store look nothing like the cookies on the website .
they were thin , flat and hard .
the taste was whatever .
cheap ingredients ?
bad recipe ?
disappointed !
hmm $ _num_ for _num_ mini cookies .
my first cookie was so crunchy it tastes like cardboard with chocolate chips .
the others were better but very thin .
i 'm never going to give them my business again .
the staff was friendly , but the prices are ridiculous .
now granted both times it was busy , but that no excuse .
its nothing special & your usual chinese menu fare .
food here is old , dry and bland .
do n't waste your money here .
the seats are n't very comfortable either .
not likely .
just disgusting .
that 's the selling point , it is cheap .
as you would expect , the food is n't that great .
the orange chicken was soggy .
the pizza was not bad but not good .
their fried rice and chow mein was okay .
decent food .
chicken teriyaki was tender .
ca n't beat the _num_ lunch ; for a limited time .
although i did not get sick , the food is marginal at best .
you have been warned .
cheap cheap cheap !
basic chinese - noodles , rice , chicken , pork , shrimp .
this is the worst excuse for a chinese buffet i have ever seen .
zero flavor to any of the dishes .
ca n't believe they are as busy as they where .
one word : disgusting !
dirty , grimy , and flavorless !
i was so upset i asked for the owner supposedly he was n't there .
i said , i would never find out because i will never return !
he refused to admit he was the owner !
this place sucks ass .
they had no sushi .
also , their teriyaki chicken fucking sucks .
it has no sauce , and is bland .
do n't go here _num_ minutes before they put dinner on the servings .
he just needs some clowns .
hey , it is cheap and you will get what you paid for .
it was so much vomit it looked like two people did it .
wrong !
why oh why did n't i check the reviews ?
the food was n't labeled correctly , and it just looked sad .
mandatory to tip _num_ % the food was n't very good .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
food was gross , service sucked , and the place stunk so bad .
i could see someone getting sick from the food here .
i do not even know how to explain this place .
probably the most cheapest and generic things i ever seen .
lol the eating experience was n't worth my time .
no thanks ; - ; that 's why i always get chopsticks .
worst buffet ever !
the food was absolutely horrible no taste !
limited selection in food .
completely unacceptable .
it was a very bad experience .
never eat here .
i have ( had ) three tommy bahama watches .
i could n't bring myself to by another , even at half price .
i found a majority of the support staff to be surly and downright rude .
in short , i would n't send my dog to this place .
the staff at this hospital were very rude .
finally minutes later acknowledge that i was standing there .
i am not taking it for the reason i had explained to her .
the after care was horrible .
only after she complained multiple times , were the issues addressed .
i do n't care if you smoke ... but what is the hospital saying ?
ridiculous !
no one knew wth was going on .
pathetic service .
worst er experience .
no actual er md on duty .
horrible hospital !
ridiculous !
they 're all incompetent and rude .
worst hospital ever .
terrible experience multiple times .
er staff is rude and uncaring .
i overall hate this hospital .
worst er ever !
stupid !
they chat and chat while ignoring me .
even when i asked , they were annoyed .
i was there for _num_ hours and should have taken only _num_ .
they lost my urine sample but did not ask me to do it again .
they promised me that i will be helped but ignored me for hours .
it was the worst place i have ever been .
one walked by and simply asked `` are you ok ? ''
`` oh you mean cause the alarm is going off ?
she walked in , rolled her eyes , turned it off and walked out .
no response from the nurses .
`` no i do n't .
_num_ attempts _num_ responses .
that was in june of _num_ .
have him wait in the waiting room ?
the worst hospital ever .
nurses do n't care .
the er is a mess .
and it gets worse from there .
they have no consideration and no compassion .
the nurses were in the back chatting away about a upcoming wedding .
they ignored me as i politely asked to see my sister .
the next day i was in the shower and nearly passed out .
the only convenience is that it is about _num_ minutes away from my home .
other than that , i was n't too pleased .
went back into the waiting room , where i say for about two hours .
i let her know i had not , and she seemed pretty confused .
they did n't communicate that i was being seen already .
just a huge lack of communication and a lot of confusion .
it 's almost 11am , and i 'm still waiting on test results .
facility is falling apart ... very unfortunate .
while the staff were very friendly and great , the wait times were ridiculous .
they did n't have any beds available so the room was torture .
five hours of torture for them not to be able to diagnose kidney stones ?
not impressed .
nurses are rude !
i felt weak and exhausted .
she backed off .
i have no problems .
excuse u ugly bitch .
after taking the bottle out of his mouth his crying was worse !
zero stars !
by far the worst hospital i have ever encountered .
the nurses kept losing my friend !
omg the worst hospitals in michigan are better than this place .
she was only there about _num_ hours .
sent a bill for blood work : $ _num_ .
sent a bill for services : $ _num_ .
sat around for _num_ hours .
called our insurance company today , they never received a claim from them .
we 've waited for _num_ hours and no dr has been assigned .
they have done some work ... but no one is here to discuss results .
horrible er visit .
no one even bothered to measure her blood pressure for the next six hours .
if i could give no stars i would .
one star is too high for this death trap .
my wife was transferred by the military base to this ill run facility .
if i can give this place a _num_ star i would gladly do so .
it 's the worst hospital i have ever been to .
what should have been a quick er trip turned into a nightmare !
i told her it happened over _num_ weeks ago and that he fell .
this hospital is horrible .
he could barely walk .
horrible horrible hospital i wish i could give it a negative _num_ stars _num_ !
this is the worse place ever and it 's very dirty .
staff are lazy and enjoy talking to coworkers more then patients .
zero stars !
if yelp has minus stars ... i would use the max !
the worst children 's hospital ever !
the left hand does n't know what the right hand is doing !
the guy i scheduled my appointment with never answered the phone !
what a hell hole .
was n't given antibiotics in the hospital .
nope , none of that .
excuse me ?
the service in the er was atrocious !
the first and last time i ever step foot in this hell hole !
that 's ridiculous !
omg omg is all i can say .
it was almost _num_ pm when he checked himself out against their recommendation .
someone in the waiting room mentioned that there was only one doctor on staff .
hmmm u may say , that 's not much for an emergency room .
they transferred me to sunrise .
i repeat , never go to this hospital !
terrible hospital !
finally got into a room _num_ hours later .
taught me how to use it wrong which caused more damage .
i am _num_ years old .
the nurses were amazing and even they admitted they hated working there .
steve , however was the worst .
they described it as criminal .
really bad and slow service .
went here for my moms kidney stones .
they would n't let me back there with her at all .
no update from anybody .
they lost a few patients as well .
very disappointed with this hospital .
absolutely ridiculous !
ok , i get it .
i thought sunrise was pretty awful .
wtf , yo ?
the nurses of sunrise really were nothing short of stellar .
unfortunately i was n't there .
simply awful !
this is the worst hospital i 've been to .
wtf are n't you the doctor ?
they have zero sense of urgency .
instead , they sit around their station , talking about their personal lives .
total fail .
this is where the incompetent and lazy go to work in the medical field .
never go here if you do n't have to .
it just so happened that sunrise was it .
the hospital is older , i understand they have a lot of traffic .
i was in pain an they just had me sitting in a chair .
i would rather drive the _num_ mins to a different hospital .
this was the worst hospital i 've ever been to .
other patients having pain needing help they yelled at and told them to wait .
yesterday was the absolute worst .
talk about terrible customer service !
she showed no empathy whatsoever .
i will update more as time goes on and i 'm here .
ok , rant over .
and third the billing staff is extremely rude and unprofessional .
worst hospital ever .
even st rose is better and that 's sad .
the nurse 's are horrible !
by far the worst hospital ever !
the staff was quite unpleasant to encounter .
and _num_ of the _num_ for $ _num_ tacos .
not acceptable !
the video poker machine at the bar actually ripped me off .
i usually love dive bars , but this place was just dismal .
i was already going to purchase the item for $ _num_ .
and then i realized that the item was a bit defective .
the only problem is that the new price was $ _num_ .
the manager came and said she could n't honor the price .
consumer report here i come .
i hate this one .
i only walk in here to see whats new .
the sales people here are stuck up and they dont care about the customer .
the service in this lv store was lackluster .
poor customer service .
so next time i want something louis , i 'll just order online .
she does not want to damage her nice bags .
my wife was so appalled that she turned around and walked out .
i do not understand why sales people are so rude .
why spend so much money in a place where they treat you like crap ?
the lady told me that it was possible and told me the fee .
if i could give a zero star , i would .
worst service i had .
walk in there tonight .
so i walk next door to gucci and what a difference in service .
the salesperson was so helpful that i ended up getting a bag from her .
oh well , lv 's loss is gucci 's gain .
he was clearly not a `` people person '' .
he was having a bad day perhaps ?
needless to say we left without a purchase .
for one , the appetizer and small plates were n't bad .
actually none of the above items were bad .
when the bowl arrived , the steam indicated it was piping hot .
it was watery , flavorless and really subpar .
there was no depth at all .
the decor was so so , nothing really special .
it looked like there was only one or two waiters available .
the food was so so , the service was lackluster .
the pieces of pork are not marinated and are tough .
too much filler ( ie , bread crumbs ) , not enough meat .
this place really is n't all hyped up to be .
i 'd rather have vietnamese pho any day .
i really do n't know what to say about this place .
so ... there is no reason to go there anymore .
i differently not going , never , ever !
i guess they are under new management and now they suck .
they also renovated the valet area so they had somewhere to place valet carts .
they also are putting lights on the front sidewalk portion of the building .
so it 's a _num_ year old building that has seen better days .
the prior review is dead on !
run do n't walk away from this old folks home !
now the bad : i rented a unit here .
these are condo units built in the _num_ 's and individually owned .
i mentioned the sewage odor and pipe issues .
i thought i was going to die , too .
your nv energy bill will be atrocious .
avoid this place if you can .
the plates .
common areas , such as hallway carpeting are disgusting and smelly .
you will get ripped off !
on the same contract was my _num_ day notice .
if i did n't sign it i would get billed for the next month .
when we explained our story the lady was really rude and inconsiderate !
the tenants say that they can not speak english then the person leaves .
i rented a steam cleaner to run over the already clean carpet .
for italian food , there are much better choices in las vegas .
i found the prices high , the portions small and the food mediocre .
ok , i 'm done .
the wine is served in large quantities , but it is not good .
it 's bad .
the food is not good .
i would say the food tasted like ass , but that would be mean .
there are better italian restaurants in your home town .
sure thing .
big mistake .
i 'm pretty sure the sauce was ragu .
the little man playing the accordion knew the ohio state fight song .
hot dang , the food was gross .
terribly , terribly gross .
but then it was paired with something ( spinach ) that was inedible .
no no no - this place is not good .
please listen ... do not waste your money !
horrible , horrible , horrible .
$ _num_ for spaghetti and meatballs in this little dump ?
if you go , make a reservation and be ready for crowds .
i ordered linguini chopped clams in a white sauce for $ _num_ .
my clams and linguini were of the $ _num_ caliber .
the wine was simply bad .
that concept just does n't work for me .
sad to report that i was disappointed when going back .
everyone 's food was alright .
nothing great or out of this world .
so take it from me , this place sucks .
impossible to know .
now one of the problems with this place is -- entrees are expensive .
the wine was n't that good , btw .
seriously , he is old and bent over .
but as far as battista 's goes -- i do n't recommend it .
the food is bad .
the wine is bad .
the salad is wilted lettuce drenched in italian dressing .
if they did , they should get out more often .
the service was not very good .
it was the most disgusting thing i 've ever tasted .
only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance .
$ _num_ , the main entree better taste good .
the pasta itself was way too al dente .
it 's more like hot chocolate .
in the evenings , one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it .
nothing special about the salad or the wines .
the guy with the accordion was a little creepy .
the absolute worst italian food at the most outrageous prices i have ever eaten .
i would rather eat at the italian garden than here .
my wife had chicken parmesan and it was tough as well .
this is a tourist trap to be avoided .
this food is worse than cafeteria food .
terrible .
i hate you , battista .
you ruined that , battista .
this place is terrible .
wow !
eating here was an absolute waste of time and money .
such a shame ... is it that hard to make decent food ?
they only ask you if you want red or white .
shrimp scampi was a bit bland and definitely not the best i 've had .
hole in the wall ?
it was like stepping back in time ... and not a good time .
it 's nothing special .
terrible food , bad value .
would not recommend this place .
the house wine was below average but the salad and garlic bread were good .
even if you cant cook , look up a recipe and try it yourself .
i do n't understand why anyone would eat here .
it 's not italian food .
the food was ok , the wine was nasty .
i 'd rather go to olive garden and that 's pretty sad .
not much seafood and like _num_ strings of pasta at the bottom .
my girlfriend 's veal was very bad .
had a strange aftertaste that for me , made it fairly inedible .
overall , a mediocre mix of food and generic experience .
one sign of this is that it is only open after _num_ pm daily .
( i am a _num_ year resident of las vegas . )
the wait was was long - _num_ minutes , because of the tour bus .
it 's not right .
i am torn between _num_ and _num_ stars .
i 'm really not one to give crappy reviews .
battista 's hole in the wall ... i hate this restaurant .
everything just tasted sooo bad .
i ca n't believe the waiters do n't feel bad serving you this food .
also , that little accordion man ... he 's sooo creepy .
this place is so over rated , it 's not even funny .
_num_ plus dollars for everything .
any type of pasta dish is over _num_ bucks .
it was not fresh , it tasted frozen and reheated .
not mention it was over thirty dollars .
it 's a bottomless house wine place .
i was celebrating my return to work and my wife 's vacation .
he warned us it is n't all that .
it looked like it needed a good cleaning threw out the dinning area .
i did n't feel like home .
all in all i will not be returning to this place ever ... .
what a mistake .
this place is so overpriced it is laughable .
paid $ _num_ for cheese tortellini with `` meat sauce '' .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
stay away for sure .
this year , everything was bad .
the salad was pre-made and wilted .
my ravioli was hot but had no flavor .
the cappuccino was not even warm .
it 's like stepping into old vegas .
i had a bite and the sauce tasted like it had tons of celery .
whatever was placed in front of me was definitely not manicotti .
manicotti is a long tube pasta .
overall , average food if the prices were low .
sorry , i do n't share the feeling .
i even told dh to quickly tip him so he could leave us alone .
we came , ate , and will never come back .
walking in , i was delighted .
the garlic bread and wine that also come with the meal were mediocre .
not sure i would return , or even suggest to it a friend though .
_num_ is white the other a red blend .
i was unimpressed but so far not bad just not good .
the garlic bread comes out and it was the highlight of the meal .
there was nothing home made tasting about the entire meal .
the chicken was dry and the veal was thin & fatty .
the sauces were thin and seemed watered down .
parking sucked !
obviously , they are only catering to tourists and their past history .
unfortunately , we will never be back there again .
cost to eat here was around $ _num_ for two of us .
the garlic bread that was more buttered than garlic ... .
however , for $ _num_ , i 'm underwhelmed lol .
the red marinara on the manicotti tasted like canned pizza sauce .
really awful .
i was so disappointed .
this is by far the worst place i 've ever eaten in my life .
but for me that is where it ended .
i thought the red was terrible and the white was less than average .
the sauce bothered me the entire evening , way too much paste .
the decor is kitschy - crap all over the place .
and yes , the accordion player was awkward to say the least .
just please , do n't go here .
sucked !
this place is a piece of las vegas history .
if it was n't for her i would not be back !
do n't expect great food though .
my linguine with clam sauce was overpowered with basil .
the serving staff was distracted and disinterested .
this is adequate but not at all great .
* '' cappuccino '' chocolate , hazelnut flavored coffee with whipped cream is yummy .
i drink cheaper wine sometimes , but this red wine was absolutely aweful .
bland .
fairly priced , but i definitely wo n't be back .
he did n't even introduce himself or ask us how the food was .
get a reservation if you really want to try it .
the white wine tasted watered down , and did n't even smell like wine .
the red wine was actually ok , it 's more sweet than dry .
the salad and garlic bread was bomb .
not good .
everything tastes canned and low quality .
the atmosphere could really work if this place had halfway decent food .
although it was full of various pieces of seafood , it was bleh .
the fish was overcooked and did not taste fresh .
it was burnt and as thick as dvd container .
the place is a total tourist trap and expensive .
and because you can be loud and obnoxious .
but mostly , you go because it comes with unlimited table wine .
not good wine .
it just was n't good .
the wine was all you can drink for a reason .
the pasta felt undercooked and the sauce was bland .
i thought the food here was horrible and overpriced .
it was just poorly prepared foo .
but $ _num_ for pasta ?
the only reason i am giving them one star is because yelp made me .
my wife asked twice if the sausage was spicy , he said no .
not good for someone with a sensitive stomach .
hell , i have had better italian food at the olive garden .
ate there a couple of hours ago with _num_ friends .
everything was awful .
we are all sick and only _num_ of us managed to finish an entree .
i 've never had worse food , of any kind , anywhere .
it is basically powdered hot chocolate made with water .
food was terrible .
sauce was tasteless .
ordered veal parm , got chicken .
only good things was the salad and the cappuccino .
this attempts to be a neighborhood eatery , but without the neighbor in mind .
tomato sauce just ok , not really memorable .
we were very disappointed .
i 'm glad we experienced battista 's but we will not return .
it was one of the worst meals i have eaten .
my cousins meal was just as bad .
would never recommend and will not go back .
i was truly was disappointed .
terrible service .
all the hostesses were cold and unfriendly .
did not smile or welcome us .
when seated the was extremely clueless .
he was very un attentive and took forever to do anything .
the food was awful .
literally , they tasted like tv dinners .
we had chicken alfredo , chicken parmesan , and beef ravioli .
everyone hated they 're dishes .
i would give it no stars if i could .
i 'm blonde but not stupid .
the wine is watered down cheap red , which i expected .
soup , canned .
salad , blah .
i guess pasta lovers ... just plain love pasta , no matter how crappy ?
the `` garlic '' bread did not taste of garlic at all .
it just tasted like parmesan cheese and italian seasoning on really greasy bad bread .
the pasta side dish with cooked fine and the sauce was not bad .
i really have no idea how some people are giving this place _num_ stars .
the wine was not that good .
the white tasted something like grape juice and the red seemed watered down .
the sauce was bland -- needed garlic and more seasonings .
the meatballs left something to be desired .
this tasted like a tv dinner .
skip it .
food is overpriced for what you 're getting , which is poor quality food .
if you do n't have a reservation do n't show up .
they tell ya _num_ mins and it turns into _num_ hours .
not worth the wait when hunger .
the menu is really limited .
the prices are literally insane .
drinks : free bottomless house wine .
not a drinker , but apparently its passable but no memorable .
service : not friendly , just efficient .
not super helpful either .
chicken alfredo ( entree ) : _num_ stars .
the sauce was fine , the grilled chicken was good .
filet mignon : ( entree ) _num_ star .
that bad .
just bland overall .
cappuccino : ( included ) was really just hot chocolate with whipped cream .
i ca n't rate it with justice because i do n't like tiramisu .
most at the table did not eat much of it .
i was a little underwhelmed by this place .
it was very dark and the decor very outdated .
i ca n't eat _num_ pounds of food .
for my entree , i had the veal parm .
the veal was n't particularly tender .
the `` cappuccino '' at the end of the meal was n't cappuccino .
all in all , i would skip this place .
there are so many better options .
just barely ok.
below average free wine .
food looks like mass prepared in mess hall .
it 's ok but but not wonderfully by any stretch .
i would n't go back nor recommend to any of my friends .
expected so much better .
food was terrible .
completely flavorless .
tired classics .
nothing i 'd come back again for .
so disappointed .
spaghetti and meatballs were gummy .
the noodles tasted like they had been cooked in stale water or something .
the service was amazing , i must say .
i do n't get it .
ok , this was my second time here .
my party of _num_ also agreed with me about their entrees ravioli , meatballs .
skip it skip it skip it !
the manicotti was dry and flavorless .
it was like i was dining in a cafeteria .
never ever recommend !
bread : nothing special .
was n't gross but it was n't super offensive .
eggplant parmigiana : i just have had better .
then you already know what this tastes like .
service : not terrible , but not super friendly or welcoming .
would you like to hear some customer favorites ?
ambiance : really dark version of buca did beppo .
overall , the word to describe this place is : meh .
impossible to find overlooked and tasteless pasta in las vegas .
that plus a _num_ minute wait with reservations .
the worst italian food i have ever had .
this place is horrendous .
we told the waitress we did n't enjoy our food and she ignored us .
the cappuccino taste like hot chocolate with a hint of coffee .
food was bland and dry .
the free wine was obviously cheap .
_num_ dinners cost $ _num_ with no extras .
i do not recommend .
the salad was what i call a lazy salad .
clearly a chef who takes no pride in what leaves the kitchen .
the kids got a small bowl of ravioli for _num_ which was boring .
the adult menu starts at _num_ with a high price over $ _num_ .
i tried the chicken parm .
it was ok but the chicken was not moist and the sauce watery .
the side of ziti was flavorless .
the spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the meatballs were overly dense .
all in all a disappointing meal .
i used to recommend this place to out of town guests but no longer .
this is an italian restaurant for tourists on a budget .
simply awful !
folks , this was the worse italian food i 've ever eaten .
maybe it was a bad day ( i doubt it ) .
it was sooooo dark inside , we could hardly read the menu .
all in all , it wo n't happen again for us .
food is not good !
i am glad that i did not pay for it .
the linguini was dried and fishy .
anybody 's home made spaghetti is better than that .
very disappointed .
but i think it should be at the same level of olive garden .
it is really `` a hole in the wall `` .
hole in the wall is right .
the cappuccino was _num_ % hot chocolate _num_ cappuccino , and _num_ hot gas .
this is not the old battista 's !
now it is overpriced pasta .
i could not get a pizza or any of the old good stuff .
this is the most horrible restaurant i have ever ate at .
the place is dark and dingy , it was dusty and nasty .
the wine is cheap vinegar that they refill after every use .
i do n't know how this place is still open .
ick .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
let me break it down list style .
menu is limited .
$ _num_ - $ _num_ per person , based on meal option .
my friend and her sister split the veal marsala ( $ _num_ ) .
price point for this disaster $ _num_ .
do n't eat here .
sorry it was n't for us .
the lasagna was a nice size portion but was not anything special .
i would not dine here again .
so disappointed in how awful this vegas `` gem '' has become .
reservations - yes you need them but why bother ?
this food is below sub par .
we sent _num_ of the _num_ dinners back .
linguine with canned clam sauce ?
powdered cappuccino with whipped cream ?
skip this restaurant !
it was simply ok.
we ate about 9:00 and service was very slow .
decor was old vegas which was nice .
overall , ok to eat at once but would n't go back again .
average wine of course , nothing special .
i did n't finish it nor take the leftovers home .
i would most likely check out other italian restaurants before returning here .
the only thing `` institution '' about this place is the food .
i try both red and white , they are identical .
we will never get those _num_ minutes of our lives back .
being asked to leave because they are closing a section completely ruined our experience .
this was the worst restaurant experience of my entire life .
the salad i ordered came with no dressing .
the garlic bread was not amazing , it was decent .
the entrees we ordered were made like the cook did n't care .
my boyfriend 's steak was awful .
it was dry , bland and overcooked .
the cappuccino tasted like a cheap water and powder mix .
our waiter did not care about us .
i paid over $ _num_ for a horrible restaurant experience .
i really wish i had tried another entre !
i was n't feeling so good after drinking all that cheap wine ... ... .
then my entree came and i was pretty disappointed .
i chose the cannelloni with meat and definitely would have preferred something else .
well ... along with everything else , it was mediocre .
but if i were you , i 'd probably skip it .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
not near a quality red wine at all !
garlic bread was soggy and under cooked .
wine was `` wine like '' soup was cold .
frozen everything except the white wine which was luke warm .
if you know what real italian food is like do n't eat here .
either way , do n't waste your money .
the food has zero flavor and is likely pulled from the freezer .
total tourist trap .
the waiter never checked back on us after the food was delivered .
the food was just ok , a c minus , d plus .
$ _num_ with no beverages and no desserts .
we wo n't return and neither should you .
but the price was the worst part .
too expensive for the quality believe the bad reviews .
the prices were ok .
the main course was horrible .
the parmesan was flavorless .
i ca n't understand why the place was so full .
save your money unless your just needing to fill your belly .
_num_ price for salad , wine , breadsticks , and entree .
the wine is bottom of the line .
there 's definitely a scene for that but it 's not for me .
no one , especially tourists , should ever eat here .
the salad is served in plastic bowls .
every dinner is served with plastic covers on scary metal hospital carts .
the after dinner cappuccino tasted like burnt caramel .
there were _num_ of us .
the cappuccino was not an espresso drink but hot chocolate with whip cream .
the food was okay but not worth the price .
the waiter was too busy to give us quality time and care .
where the hell were you back then , yelp ?
thousands from around the world could 've been warned at least _num_ years earlier .
pasta was boiled ahead of time and reheated .
even the garlic bread was foul .
it was n't even cheap .
not worth it .
the all you can drink wine is terrible .
i am literally sitting in here waiting for our order to b taken .
fool me once , battista 's , shame on you .
fool me twice ... .
but the food sucked .
and it was n't even cheap ! ''
that 's why they get the 2nd star .
where they really failed was the entre .
ok fine , i 'll take the chicken rio .
it 's chicken and pasta in a white sauce .
more like straight heavy cream they poured on the plate .
it seriously has no taste , just a fatty consistency .
my original review stands : i could make better italian food at home .
and it would be _num_ times better .
insult to injury : this meal cost me over $ _num_ !
i wish i could give negative stars .
bad service .
bad food .
bad management .
so , we order the chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs .
no apology from the server and manager never even came over .
we paid $ _num_ ( after tax ) for food we did n't eat .
save yourself the time and money try finding good italian food elsewhere .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
the food was quite possibly the worst italian food i 've ever eaten .
she just said `` okay i 'll tell them '' and walked away .
i will not return to this place nor do i recommend this place .
they 're simply trying to move as many people through as possible .
half of our party was n't even finished with their meal .
no dish cheaper than $ _num_ ... and that was for simple spaghetti .
the better dishes are $ _num_ and up .
it 's designed to push as many patrons through as they can .
not italian .
this is definitely a hole in wall .
it was _num_ hours wait to be seated .
my spaghetti was horrible and bland , as was my husband 's dish .
i will say the salad , minestrone soup and table wine were fine .
but for the price we paid , i would not recommend this place .
you ca n't charge $ _num_ for something that is n't perfection in vegas !
i ordered the same think i ordered last time ... chicken rio ... .
i could tell not freshly cooked !
no compensation nothing !
the food lacked flavor !
i had lasagna and honestly , trader joes frozen lasagna is much much better .
my companion had spaghetti and meatballs and said it was lacking flavor as well .
the big draw here is the cheap unlimited free wine !
do n't expect anything too flavorful .
it was inedible .
- the vegetable minestrone soup is made from beef broth .
the server did n't mention it until we specifically asked .
why call it vegetable soup if it is n't vegetarian ?
it has way too much sugar .
- the clam pasta had _num_ clams each the size of a dime .
- the vegetarian pasta ( tomato based sauce ) was bland and flavorless .
-the lighting in the restaurant is horrid .
and we could n't enjoy whatever little taste the food had .
disappointed !
the meatballs were good , but the sausage was lacking in taste .
what a rude waiters .
nasty and uncooked food .
i had italian food before and it 's just waste of money .
dirty restaurant .
we were really really disappointed .
for the sauce to be that bad , it was just utterly shocking .
there were only _num_ seats available for _num_ people .
this was a total `` miss '' in my book .
apparently it 's gotten much worse .
there are many other , better choices for italian food elsewhere in vegas .
food is bland and severely lacks in taste and seasoning .
what a mistake .
food was very poor quality .
spaghetti came out .
not even enough sauce to cover the pasta .
overall terrible experience .
hubby and i had such a poor experience here .
the whole `` cover charge '' if you are sharing is ridiculous .
really dumb .
my friends and i were so excited to try this restaurant .
there were _num_ of us , and we were never offered any more .
from seating to signing the bill was exactly _num_ hour .
the included cappuccino was not even coffee .
a very unpleasant experience .
with the hundreds of restaurants in las vegas , this is a major failure .
but i wo n't be coming back here .
i 'm italian and from new york and this is not italian food .
horrible tasting sauce .
the atmosphere is just plain stupid and tacky .
oh and for the food the prices suck .
the most bland tasting italian food that i have ever had !
we had linguine and clams , manicotti , and lasagna .
each dish was equally lackluster .
this is the equivalent to what you will find in new jersey .
i do n't need to have this kind of food outside of new jersey .
$ _num_ per pound ?
i tried the hazelnut milkshake and was just ice !
poor customer service .
i said out loud , '' i 'd like to buy something ! ''
so inappropriate !
i sent an email to corporate and have heard nothing .
short girl with the glasses was just rude .
tell her to smile or at least not be so rude and snobby .
been here for five minutes and was annoyed .
i turned around to see where she went and it was nothing important .
after she ignored me finally another employee asked if i needed help .
second worst vs i 've been to .
walk in and no one greets us .
the staff here has the worst customer service skills !
dont waste your time coming here !
a rice and noodle only plate .
it came to ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
are you people insane ?
no flavor , and average as the day is long with restaurant style pricing .
it looks like panda express but tastes nothing compared to it .
had a funky sour taste .
not a fan .
i should have checked yelp on my phone before coming here .
yelp must have gotten paid money by this restaurant to remove bad reviews .
shame on you yelp !
hopefully they can investigate these concerns .
everything that could be wrong with it was .
now the bulk ... .
the chicken was chewy and crunchy ?
this place is why mcdonald 's is always an option .
nah , the place is a complete ripoff .
my kids chicken was mostly bread coating with sauce .
the rice had zero flavor and was pretty old tasting .
got chow mein , orange chicken and kung pao chicken .
i would choose panda express over this any day .
this place does n't deserve any stars .
we were disappointed to see they did not have the new flavors featured online .
the ice cream itself was delicious , but the price tag was ridiculous .
almost _num_ $ for two scoops of ice cream in a plain cup .
the worker was rude and seemed irritated to have business as well .
i would recommend going to get some gelato at bellagio .
it 's better tasting , better quality and a better price .
expensive and not that great !
great ice cream however service was poor .
i wanted to use that to buy water but she would n't let me .
we wo n't be going back .
for $ _num_ it was not worth it .
bad service and bad product .
_num_ damn ice cream scoops came out to _num_ bucks !
the ordeal took over an hour .
she showed me what the item looked like and sent me to this location .
come to find , she has no idea what the item looks like .
i will not go back .
i was wrong .
the waitress was not helpful and slow .
the food is not for me .
it was a chance i was willing to make trying new cuisine .
when it came time for the bill , it was wrong .
i pointed the mistake out to the waitress because it did n't add up .
the bill was not clear at all .
not the place in town i would recommend first for ethiopian fare .
the bean sauces and vegetable dishes tasted like leftovers from some days ago .
i would certainly not recommend this place .
the amenities on the web site are a lie .
i was severely sick after and my doctor told me to get out .
no compensation , no consideration .
complain all you want , nothing ever gets done .
not so much .
the acrylic did not even cover my entire nail bed .
worst nail salon if that 's what you even want to call this dump .
the full set was sloppy and looks horrible .
please do not waste your time or money here .
this place should be shut down , not a relaxing environment !
my mom and i went to get our mani and pedi done .
i had to file and shape my nails at the salon myself .
low budget and you will get what you pay for !
not surprised !
that was the worst experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
find the real deal while in vegas .
do n't waste your taste buds here .
you 're not missing anything special other a friendly staff .
it is not great yet it is not awful it is merely decent .
i had a beef burrito and it was to say the least mediocre .
the food was very mediocre americanized mexican food .
the side of beans were so salty it was barely edible .
i was very disappointed as i love coleslaw .
i left the restaurant unsatisfied and feeling a bit sick .
i felt bad because i took my coworkers there with me .
the only good thing i have found was the nice outdoor dining patio .
i 've been to this location _num_ times prior , and had mixed feelings .
i just figured it was a fluke last time , but alas nothing changed .
the bartender that worked today made the worst margarita i have ever had .
nothing to brag about , nothing to compliment .
i know mexican food damn it .
i have ( ex ) mexican in-laws .
too .
that 's not authentic to me .
f this place .
the salad - even the dressing is better at your local sushi joint .
the whole thing was gross .
sadly , the ambiance during out last visit to benihana was visual only .
and it kept going off .
ignoring it was not appropriate though .
_num_ stars , and they are lucky to get that .
rude and unhelpful !
well i was either young and dumb or just starving for food and entertainment .
depending on what you get , its a free meal , so why not ?
drinks were large and fruity , just the way i like em .
i have never been to any benihana before .
one star is too much .
i could have done better in my own kitchen .
terribly disappointed .
the service was horrible .
i ca n't really explain the interaction but it was n't that great .
i was full i just remember leaving disappointed .
benihana at las vegas hotel & casino is the worst place ever !
decor was nice , food was not .
he could have add some garlic , little bit rosemary and lime grass .
meat with butter , could n't even test meat .
i would not recommend this place .
not traditional japanese food , and very underwhelming .
tonight we had a reservation for _num_ for a family birthday dinner .
she talked constantly and advised us she was sick , great thanks !
we told her _num_ of our party had gone to the restroom .
ugh , where to begin ?
gross .
my date had tofu steak which was worse .
it was undercooked , soggy , and flavorless as well .
no such luck .
the dcor is _num_ stars alone .
mind you , my mother made a reservation several days ago .
so i could n't really eat anything at this place .
she then told me that she was going to charge me to sit there .
such a stupid thing .
what a terrible experience .
i 'll be sure to never go to this place again .
i was not happy with any part of our dinner experience .
the service was n't horrible , but not impressive at all .
the drinks were really bad , watered down .
the food was worse !
the mushroom broth was nothing to get excited about .
the dressing on the salad was watery , with very little flavor .
our chef on the hibachi table had very little personality or skill .
the food was cut in huge pieces , not bite size at all .
their so called garlic has no bit of garlic flavor what so ever .
i really was extremely unhappy with every part of this restaurant .
we were a party of _num_ celebrating a wedding and birthday .
the `` chef '' who prepared our food had no personality .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
the food itself is very poor here .
group of _num_ for lunch .
hurry up eat and leave .
the sushi bar is terrible .
the fish is far from quality and the rice could n't be less inspiring .
the las vegas hotel and all it 's amenities are a ghost town .
it was downright odd .
but probably not then either .
then the food was dry and flavorless !
ridiculous !
they comped us our drinks for the horrible service ... big deal .
pitiful experience !
i would not recommend benihana and will never go back .
our hostess could have given better service .
if this review were only about him , he would get _num_ stars .
worst service in las vegas !
no attention from cocktail waitress for an hour .
waited _num_ minutes for sushi .
rude hosts .
never going back .
went here on the 4th and it was n't too pleasant .
the meal was ok but the friend chicken rice was terrible !
horrible service- host and waitress barely spoke english .
we had to wait _num_ minutes after asking twice for drink refills .
food was good , but overall it was a very bad dining experience .
worst hibachi joint in the vegas area .
the waitress flat out ignored most of the people at the table .
i was n't going to pay for things i did n't ask for .
they gave me such a small portion of chicken .
and the waitress blatantly ignored the dirty glasses etc on our table .
i spend $ _num_ on a mediocre meal with awful service .
so disappointed !
she also gave herself a tip by keeping the change from the bill .
quite simply , the employees rushed us to eat .
it was terrible how badly they rushed us .
it was obnoxious .
the service made me never want to go back there again .
we had chicken , shrimp and steak .
it 's a shame because it could 've been such a fantastic experience .
nothing appeared new , it just looked further tucked in the back .
we then got to walk completely across the property to get to the restaurant .
not quite sure why .
it 's a shame that benihana corporation lets this sort of thing go on .
i wo n't be back .
asked for medium well , tasted like liver and it was super dry .
never going back and never recommending this location .
after _num_ mins of waiting we received our soup and salad before our drinks .
food was good but the fry rice was a little under cooked .
i wont be coming back because that service was extremely horrible .
nothing special .
highly disappointed .
do they use the same jokes in all japanese steak houses ?
it was ok , but nothing special .
trash in the fountain pool .
they would not seat our party of _num_ until the last person arrived .
the seating is very uncomfortable .
it 's worse then sitting on a small plane .
they really have lost all sense of customer service .
even the most busy place in vegas works hard to serve the customer .
this is sad and unfortunate .
i personally feel that their management is terrible and impersonal .
a once great place to go and eat is now ruined by poor management .
so very unfortunate .
i would really recommend spending your hard earned money somewhere else .
$ _num_ for tofu !
the drink of course was all sweetness and no alcohol .
but otherwise , this location is kind of hard to recommend .
( the lowest priced steak option on the menu ) .
our waiter was n't the nicest i 've ever encountered either .
the decor of this place is old and needs some serious updating .
the food was ok not much flavor on the chicken .
if you want to sit on the toilet for a few days come here .
boy was i wrong .
first of all it was nearly empty on a saturday night .
that should 've been a clue .
the service was mediocre .
it nearly took _num_ hours to eat .
i wo n't be back .
i come to benihana all of the time but this location disappointed me .
truly the worst service of any benihana !
terrible management .
do not bother to eat at this place .
_num_ minutes waiting to be seated another _num_ min waiting for the food .
then you will find out they send the wrong dishes .
wrong !
for the issue they covered our drinks .
imo they should have covered the meal .
we all left very unhappy with our experience .
um ok , a little late to the game but whatever .
_num_ more minutes go by and oh look our chef .
for a reservations only place i 'd expect better .
if this was my very first time experiencing hibachi i would be really disappointed .
they did n't wow me one way or another .
i got hibachi chicken it was plain and rubbery .
the sauces they give you ... awful .
the chef was very concerned , it was an accident , they happen .
not great but i was so hungry because the food was sooo bland .
chef david was tired .
this location is terrible .
celebrated my birthday and was disappointed .
slow service , rude management , and decent food .
horrible , disrespectful customer service from front desk staff !
yelp lists this location as closing at _num_ but they really close at _num_ .
i do n't understand how this place gets even remotely good reviews .
and the staff who said that to me were completely rude and condescending .
they lost me as a customer .
the las vegas restaurant has lost it charm .
it would have been helpful to know before hand .
i cancelled and ordered salmon roll instead because i felt taken advantage of .
it was ok , my salmon roll tasted like mayo and cream cheese roll .
little bit of salmon , $ _num_ for this .
wo n't be returning .
not worth the money .
the meat and lobster was not season very bland .
overall this restaurant is overrated and overpriced .
no value anymore .
nothing helped .
otherwise , the decor was not the worst ever .
it was one level higher than motel _num_ , i think .
none of us ever touched the phone inside the room !
i barely finished anything and i 'm the buffet king .
the food at the buffet is just as bad .
this place was terrible .
its was cheap compared to the rest of the hotels on the strip .
the out side was typical , with a average decor .
we walked in smiling and said hello .
but the server is not professional .
i have very bad experience on today !
the staff did n't seem to be able to manage an office very efficiently .
that 's no problem .
it has been _num_ months that i have been dealing with this issue .
she gave me some mickey mouse prescription that i feel is wrong .
it was a mistake going there , and i will never go back .
i am still waiting on them to refund me my money .
too bad that i ca n't give zero stars .
the worst optometrist 's office ever .
for a high end watch store i was expecting better service .
great selection but their snobby sales staff will send you running out the door .
i suggest you avoid this shop and its a shame .
the costumer service was the worst !
those _num_ are just the worst people you could go to ... .
the wheels and main spring need to be replaced for $ _num_ .
so i took my money and went elsewhere .
i emailed to inquire and after _num_ days without reply i email back .
first year was great .
cockroaches everywhere , things were constantly breaking because maintenance sucks .
bus somehow my power bill always was super high .
yes , u cant use it until they turn it on .
there 's been _num_ managers in _num_ months .
these apartments have really went down hill .
do not move here you 'll really regret it .
there are always maintenance issues either no hot water , water or ac .
the management is awful .
the girls up front incompetent .
they either never answer when you call and never return your messages .
i called security ( of course ) , no answer .
not another month will i be here .
ca n't wait to move .
this is las vegas ' ghetto mall as everyone has already mentioned .
the clientele is not the kind you let your children shop around .
i hate to say it , but this mall is kind of ghetto .
three stores i never buy anything from anyway .
fashion show has all the stores boulevard has and more .
after shopping at sears i decide to check out the mall .
but there are still a bunch of shoe stores .
no way .
hell yeah .
same brand and all too .
this place is an empty shell .
if they clean up , i may just start coming back .
that 's sad .
i also miss the pet store .
no thank you .
the area is not considered too be that great .
las vegas visitors , do n't come here !
you will be so bored out of your mind !
i do n't recommend .
i try on shoes , i circle the store about _num_ times .
the only good place here is old navy .
it 's been going downhill for years .
the mall should have been closed down years ago !
secondly , there are absolutely no good food options .
the customers are less then desirable .
i only go to that mall when i absolutely have to .
usually by no choice of my own .
i wo n't be back .
everything else is gone .
the food court is ridiculous .
why is boulevard mall called a mall ?
no clue .
i guess you only need _num_ stores to be considered a mall .
another lady was offered teriyaki chicken sample from a chicken place .
i do n't eat skin .
i do n't like it .
if you do n't like this place , why do you go ?
not so much .
this mall used to be the ish in middle school and high school .
the rest of the food court is n't worth mentioning either .
odd selection of independent businesses , mostly empty .
not a good commercial location at all unless one is a chain store .
the only good store they have here is victoria secret but the service sucks !
the security guards were so rude and disrespectful .
i felt so offended cause i was n't doing anything wrong .
horrible !
do n't even waste your time at the sketchy ass mall .
i do n't like coming to this mall .
it 's kind of depressing to see it so empty .
reviewing only the mall itself , you 'll always find parking though .
- i just tossed half my order .
it tasted horrible .
i could n't eat it .
i went from starving to no appetite in the matter of a few seconds .
it was that bad .
after their machine refused to scan my card the first _num_ times .
finally she asks the cooks and they have no idea what 's going on .
but to my surprise they do n't want to remedy the situation .
no customer service or customer satisfaction .
terrible service .
called after i purchased an item for service and they brushed me off .
bad service and a small selection of supplies .
they had an okay selection of electronic parts but their customer service is terrible .
they were cold and generally useless .
i 've visited this restaurant on various occasions .
food 's always tasty but service is unfriendly , and below average .
did n't know what else to do , so we just left .
it was n't poor quality it just was n't good italian food .
a towel with some soda water and a little more attitude .
i was pretty disappointed with this restaurant .
frozen pizza literally tastes better than what i ate .
came here to get some grub before going out .
half of us ended up getting full just off of the bread .
i hope not , i 've been living by that for a while .
i was disappointed .
seriously , they could have at least added enough to fill up the plate .
the sea bass itself was disappointing too .
instead , it was dry and a little tough .
but also nothing that made it stand out , other than location .
the service was painfully slow and the food was simply average .
on the positive side , the bartender was descent .
the atmosphere was sadly the most impressive aspect of the restaurant .
the service was decent and the food was mediocre at best .
not impressed at all .
sorely disappointed .
the service basically sucked .
my friends were also not impressed with their food .
the service was deplorable .
we had requested an open table next to the street for a better experience .
but the way he talked to us was out of the question .
not as overpriced as some other places but not great .
i would 've spent the extra money to get better food and better service .
the food was too salty and kinda bland .
my wife did not like their seafood linguini .
my veal was not bad but no sauce or flavor to it .
portions are good but then again , i would rather have quality than quantity .
my suggestion , spend a little more and get quality food .
awful experience ... definitely put a bad taste in my mouth .
another person mentioned that theirs were bland .
one : this reminds me of something i would get at the olive garden .
i say skip it and put your money elsewhere .
the food is ok , but overpriced .
if i walked around my restaurant like that , i 'd be fired .
i mean , really ?
the meal was average , and not really worth the price .
the fish was overcooked and mushy .
my dinner companion had steak with very overcooked spinach .
or maybe i was n't trying the right thing .
fine , by me - but it really did n't do much .
penne pasta with chicken , vegetables , tossed in a red sauce .
service was slow .
really would n't recommend this place .
the food was mediocre and completely not worth the price .
the service was also incredibly slow and not the best .
no one was particularly friendly .
it just could have been better , hence the `` meh .
nothing really stood out about this italian restaurant .
the entire dish looked like shit on a plate the way it was presented .
like the way rotten fish smells that 's how it tasted .
_num_ entrees plus a bottle of wine .
food is ok , i 've had better .
do n't care too much for it .
we also returned the ceasar salad due to a fishy taste .
my filet was not bad .
they do n't use enough salt or spice .
the salads were n't fresh , neither were the tomatoes .
service : inattentive , mostly useless .
i wo n't bother going back .
the food was unremarkable .
this place was just completely meh .
the food was bland and boring , as were the drinks .
this place was a bit of a disappointment .
service was slow and spotty .
when we were seated , the waitress told us she was sending out water .
after the whole experience , i would probably not come back .
this place was probably the worst disappointment of our vegas trip .
we had an extremely mediocre lunch here .
the service was ok , the food itself was so-so .
another co-worker had a very dull looking margherita pizza .
my wife had a very ordinary salad with a very ordinary minestrone .
for extremely mediocre italian food , this is your choice .
not the top on my list for authentic italian food .
and of course we received sample bread with a balsamic vinegar oil .
the waiter never asked if we were okay or needed anything else after ordering .
however , the dinner experience was severely disappointing .
- horrible reservation service .
not a common practice , but it was valentines day , so fair enough .
we rushed the taxi driver .
the place was empty .
_num_ minutes later we were informed that they were `` out '' .
the restaurant was _num_ % full and it was early in the evening .
simply no excuse for this .
nothing to write home about .
the salmon was over cooked and dry .
enough said , not good .
worst than olive garden .
i ordered the beef risotto and my boyfriend ordered the cannelloni di pollo .
the beef was probably the only highlight to the risotto .
if they say _num_ more minutes we are gon na die .
slow service .
meanwhile , at least _num_ % of the restaurants outdoor seating alone was empty .
we were turned down and they lost a sale because of it .
i do n't understand why we could n't have been seated somewhere else .
absolutely ridiculous .
do not recommend on this count .
gave it two stars because bread was good .
overall very disappointing .
you could tell it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever .
my husband returned his meal and exchanged it for a pizza .
`` shut up bitch ... dont be cheap next time .
it was a terrible experience !
sadly , this was not the end of it .
to top it off the food was sub-par .
the apple crepe dessert was soggy and thick .
overall , this was a horrible way to spend our wedding reception .
not very busy downstairs , upstairs was empty apart from us .
they changed all the plates , but things did not get better from here .
dessert of apple icecream with cinnamon apple crepe was not interesting .
apple ice cream tasted artificial and crepe was thick and soggy .
slow slow slow and the food was not worth the wait .
third time was not a charm and i will not be going back .
avoid like the plague .
if you 're forced to eat here , definitely sit outside on the patio .
also , descriptions of this place being classy is really pushing some low standards .
one should never be left thirsty in las vegas .
tried some of my friend 's pizza ... wish i had n't .
wo n't go back and ca n't recommend it .
by that time my warm tomatoes with mozzarella was cold tomatoes with mozzarella .
my main course was grilled fish with vegetables .
good food .
terrible service .
why was n't she on the floor .
why did it take _num_ people to find her ?
the waiter sucked and did n't upsell a thing !
this is vegas is n't it ?
but i should n't feel so special .
believe me , it was hard .
even applebee 's servers would n't dare speak to their patrons like that .
but really , what was that going to do for us at that time .
i would of appreciated an apology from the server or management .
but no one came to the table to do so .
btw , the server 's name is josh .
you 're a douche for all those comments and a horrible server .
just plan bad .
i wish i can say the same for my second visit .
it was just not as good as i remembered it .
the rice was also hard to eat .
it became difficult for me to enjoy the food .
it did n't have that much flavor , and was pretty bland .
very disappointed with this restaurant .
waiters and atmosphere were great but it goes downhill from there .
most of the food was terrible .
the margarita pizza was very oily .
really the only good thing was the atmosphere and that 's not enough .
this place sucks the food so poor and bad for what you are paying .
very disappointed in this restaurant .
service was ridiculously slow .
for it being a pricy restaurant they sure were n't on their game .
so we wo n't be going back .
they ordered _num_ , _num_ each .
we regretted , our fault , not sending this back .
the service ; however , is horrible !
you tell me if that 's rude and unprofessional !
they ruined the ambience ( because people were starving ! )
are you kidding me ?
as for the pizza , i was also really disappointed in the taste .
as for the salmon , it was meh .
not bad but not crazy good .
i have no complaints about it but also not rushing to order it again .
not the first time and only because it 's a party .
could n't have been worse .
service was terrible .
overpriced garbage .
got the chicken cannelloni ; took an hour to get to table .
i 've literally never had worse food .
how does an italian place mess up pasta ?
do not waste your time and money .
unless you have _num_ hours to kill and no taste buds .
we noticed several empty tables .
we waited _num_ minutes , watching her argue with a co-worker .
an older gentleman walked over and seated our party of _num_ .
mama mia , that 's a shitty restaurant !
pluses : nada damn thing .
the beverages were even wrong .
summary : _num_ hours later , _num_ unsatisfied customers , _num_ cases of diarrhea .
nice location in the venetian , but i would n't eat there again .
too much great food in vegas .
dont come if you dont want to waste your time here .
service was horrible !
bad service !
food was not even mediocre !
this placed rocked years ago , yet has gone downhill pretty hard !
really sad !
after _num_ minutes of no contact from anyone we decided to leave .
we asked our waiter to recommend a white wine .
for the price , i expect way better service .
none of the five in our party felt that they had anything special .
not good .
olive oil a little bitter .
margarita pizza was blah .
fried veggies were ok .
service was poor .
vegetables not served with main course and coffee never made it with the dessert .
this place has really fallen down since i last ate here .
the value is not here !
of course at these prices middle of the road is unacceptable .
the kicker it was tasteless .
really a total waste time of a meal .
not worth it .
but this time around , it was just horrible .
got my food with less then _num_ little small pieces of chicken .
good luck .
worse chicken plate for _num_ $ that i ever had .
sorry but i rather eat at olive garden .
was very disappointing .
would not recommend nor will i revisit this place any time soon again .
waiter was not as attentive either .
terrible service , mediocre food .
hated our experience here .
writing this review is making me angry .
ordered squid ink risotto and seafood linguine .
they were under cooked and tasted alright .
had half portion as they were good .
will not recommend this place and will not return .
expensive considering value , wo n't be back .
the salad was ok but the pasta with pink cream sauce was outstanding .
the entrees , unfortunately , were disappointing for the most part .
our entree choices were risotto , salmon , chicken and ny steak .
based on everyone 's comments , all but the salmon were disappointing .
the risotto and chicken were dry .
the ny steak lacked any flavor and were undercooked .
bad experience started on entering the venetian and extended throughout the meal .
rude tourist `` cattle car '' service from hostess through staff and management .
mediocre food at more than mediocre prices .
i had the risotto with shrimp , crab and artichokes .
it was tasteless , undercooked , overpriced and did n't improve with salt .
the trio pasta was awful and tasted like airplane food !
horrible food for the price .
salad looked like crap , no flavor .
he commented that we looked very young and he needed to see id .
we felt rushed as we decided on appetizers and entrees .
there 's plenty of italian restaurants in venetian so avoid this one .
a margarita pizza with processed mozzarella in an italian restaurant in the venetian .
she is rude .
my husband ordered rib eye the taste was way off .
i had gnocchi very very under seasoned and very small portion .
we realized they likely just did n't want to serve us .
total disaster .
would not recommend .
i had the worst welcoming ever .
so we ordered pasta and a bottle of wine .
and the so cold manager refused to fix the mistake .
not good .
extremely pricy ... $ _num_ for a _num_ inch margherita pizza .
pizza is awful !
margherita & veggie pizza are terrible .
i do n't recommend & wo n't go back .
place is not busy .
we left unhappy , staff could care less .
disappointing .
the gnocchi was mushy .
our water was n't refilled once .
walk down the street to ellis island for a better experience .
seriously a wet rag would go a long way .
not my scene .
dark , dingy , and kinda gross .
the crowd is jean shorts & t-shirts .
go one block down to ellis island and get better beer and food cheaper .
sad day that my vegas hangout has jumped the shark .
sorry but i must post something on this shop in the venetian .
positively the worst salon i 've ever encountered .
this place is very over priced for no reason !
i paid $ _num_ and it definitely was not worth it .
yes they saw me standing their !
if i had an option to give it no stars , i would .
this is by far the worst salon ever !
they over charge for horrible work .
and what 's worse , my hair looks nothing like the picture .
it looks worse !
the girl who did my hair had a terrible attitude from beginning til end .
i fell asleep .
when i woke up , i thought i was having a nightmare .
i do n't care if i look great .
it was n't the hair i asked for .
i was in complete shock and horror .
it 's not worth it .
i had to quickly get up , pay and leave .
very disappointed and a inconvenience for me to get it done again !
i asked for a long layered v and my layers are completely uneven .
he did n't even bother framing my hair around my face .
worst haircut ever .
also i want my money back .
i paid money for the worst haircut of my life .
big mistake !
this one looks and smells so much older than the other .
the pool is too small .
there were less than _num_ floors and the views from the rooms are crap .
what a disappointment !
we just got back from a _num_ night stay .
they realized that a timeshare sale was not going to happen .
the room was ok but definitely nothing special .
so here is the good the bad and the ugly !
decor ... again ok nothing special .
i 've stayed in better .
it looks like around _num_ square feet .
there is no room service here .
there is no restaurant .
they do not deliver room service .
no , `` i 'm sorry , how can i help you ? ''
the room was n't ready .
the front desk and concierge have zero customer service skills , imho .
i wo n't be staying at this property again .
as mentioned , there is a deli on site .
no , i wo n't be staying here again .
this is the worst place i 've ever stayed in vegas !
because had i known this up front i would have never booked this hotel .
they are so money hungry it 's just unbelievable .
this is a `` hilton '' and they should have been more accommodating .
the lumpy beds need to be tossed out of the window .
not clear on the concept .
i wiped it with a dry napkin and it got dirty .
no resturant ( small deli snack bar ) , no bar .
creepy staff with no people skills .
very unfriendly desk clerks , no restaurant inside .
big mistake .
it was n't worth that much .
the hotel itself is just regular , sometimes even worst .
she did n't just care .
needless to say , the hotel manager switched us into a new room .
on january _num_ , _num_ i called to reserve a block of rooms .
if customer service is important to you then i suggest staying away .
first bad customer service and now not following through on ones word .
most of the room has no views and the room smells .
for the same price , you can find a much better hotels near strip .
oh , and what do we get for the wonderful $ _num_ per night ?
first is was $ _num_ to do the transfer .
then another $ _num_ for a name change .
they still have n't done it .
any messages left will not be returned .
they were planning on calling me back .
they will want another $ _num_ .
this is the biggest ripoff i have ever encountered .
i ca n't wait to be done with these guys !
what a nightmare .
i already gave you guys $ _num_ for a crappy room .
so , that 's about $ _num_ just for the deposit for the room .
you ran my card _num_ times and it worked all _num_ times .
ok i am joking about the last one .
big mistake .
he did n't even take off his mistake .
i was more than willing to not take it with me .
i was really livid .
overall , i would not recommend it .
no wonder the place is so dead all the time .
good food , embarrassing poor service , weird location .
manager 's door before finding this place as the rear of the casino .
should i really beg to pay ?
if only i had the water or tea to wash it down with .
not as high as other sushi places .
no customer should leave feeling he was forced to give an insulting amount .
terrible .
it 's sad and depressing .
does n't even have old vegas charm .
prices were unbelievable expensive .
we ate teppanyaki .
its old ugly dirty restaurant .
the restaurant was empty when we went .
i am giving this place _num_ stars because the food was ok .
but the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat .
this place sucks .
_num_ bucks for dragon roll ... come on .
_num_ bucks for four pieces of sushi .
should have went to mandalay bay or luxor for some fine seafood .
unfortunately .
disgusting .
that 's how bad this place is .
big , slow , decent food , expensive .
i was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was empty .
for an assorted boat of sashimi was $ _num_ bucks .
it was a bit sweeter than most places .
the presentation was even horrible .
they should call is cucumber salad with a dash of seaweed .
we walked in around _num_ pm on a tuesday .
initially there was no staff to greet or seat us .
after getting seated it was apparent that there was only _num_ waitress .
they only had _num_ bento boxes as options for their lunch menu .
it 's not worth it .
she stopped by them _num_ times and never came to check on us .
even the celery and veggies in the roll were limp !
like another yelper stated ... every roll tasted like a california roll .
should n't it ?
gave the place _num_ stars because the service was at least good .
i have only came here once & was disappointed .
the prices were too expensive for the food .
this should have been our first clue not to enter the restaurant .
the prices were way too expensive for the food they brought out .
never will we come back to this restaurant .
ugh , yet another bad auto services experience .
_num_ weeks later i still did n't have my car .
okay that explains the _num_ week turnaround time .
i round up the money , glance at my car .
it was neither .
they just walked away .
they should n't even be allowed to call themselves a body shop .
worst experience ever .
a week goes by and i still have heard nothing .
i call and get no answer , my mother calls and gets no answer .
i was like i have pictures from the crash with no crack .
needless to say they refused to fix it and i took my car .
i would recommend them to no one .
i was very unhappy with their service .
a _num_ day job took _num_ days .
second , the complex was built in _num_ 's and requires major .
last sunday morning , had an issue with the toilet .
contacted security , who in turn , contacted the maintenance dept .
dept was too lazy to make an effort !
if i could give zero stars i fucking would !
very fucking rude workers and customer service !
people complaining of roaches is nasty as hell too !
had a horrible experience here .
_num_ minutes later ( i have a show to catch ! )
i 'd rather go out of my way to buy the product elsewhere .
i was blown away by her rudeness .
needless to say we left without buying anything .
wo n't b back .
not even for an exchange or store credit .
they gave me store credit with no questions or problems .
there was a sales associate on the phone with a customer .
i wo n't be stepping foot into this particular location again .
then they decide to stop and have a deep conversation outside the car .
dillard 's is utterly disgusting and trashy .
the employees are unhelpful and not trained for their department .
even worse they pressure you into getting the in store charge card .
ok this store just got a big fat zero !
sorry do n't except the excuse different department .
you 're the same fucking store and the store manager would n't do shit .
they sell out dated cloths that no one wants at a discounted price .
not my type of store .
unless you have lots of time to spare .
having said that i do n't mean you wo n't find anything here .
almost like its made from cardboard .
too bad !
my review based on more than a few visits .
every time i 'm shocked by staff 's attitude .
they are not rude , they just do n't care .
my size is _num_ .
she brought _num_ for all of them .
last time i was there , the music was extremely loud .
in about _num_ min i asked again .
she said she did n't control the sound .
but nobody else was in the store .
that 's kind of ridiculous .
however i return the second shoe for it small because i did n't try .
now i know they exchange to me it 's no brand new !
cause i never wear that shoes !
i 'm so angry !
the viewing the next day was terribly uncomfortable .
also as other reviewers stated , the prices were ridiculous .
we both felt pressured into purchasing a more expensive package than we had discussed .
be careful dealing with this company .
kelly refused to do this .
very expensive low to mid quality .
but no !
do not buy on site from these people !
a week went by and nothing in my email .
so i wait and wait .
not even close .
$ _num_ for _num_ pics , or _num_ for _num_ pic .
i would not be receiving free pics in an email .
bad bad business practices .
i 've had a couple of very bad experiences with them .
_num_ ) i went to the boys ii men concert and took a photo .
these people were a great disappointment .
we immediately went to the concierge to complain .
it is also and additional $ _num_ for use of the fitness center .
i should 've learned my lesson a long time ago ... no buffets !
not even vegas .
not even at the wynn .
not worth the price .
nothing special .
yes , the signature has gotten me spoiled .
i 'm not gon na ' spend any more money at the wynn .
... if you like the wynn , you 'd love the signature @ mgm .
boring .
what the f is up with all the fake flowers .
i thought it looked bad and cheap .
what they are n't getting enough money from the cheap buffet or casino ?
it looks cool at first but it 's really just cheesy and fake .
i would also like to note the fake grass outside .
i have not tried stayed here in the rooms .
as for the casino i do n't understand the hype .
for some reason it feels snobby in the wynn .
i am extremely disappointed .
they use cheap tactics to make a cheap few extra bucks .
it 's no big deal .
but not snobby wynn !
dishonest !
okay ... it 's more like _num_ 1/2 stars .
do n't believe the hype .
also , the fact that the clerk was snotty did not help .
however , the bedroom was small , and there was no additional living area .
surprisingly , it was a non issue for us .
the pool area was decent and the buffet was fabulous .
i was annoyed given that this never should have happened .
they sent someone up with tools to remove it .
they always seem to get what they want .
it was $ _num_ for two cheeseburgers .
$ _num_ charge for using the gym .
buffet sucks .
so , about two weeks pass , when i receive an e-mail from hotwire .
to say the least , we were not happy yelpers .
i will stick with my vegas staple , venetian from now on .
i thought this is too conservative and expensive .
go play blackjack or craps at any other place , but not at wynn .
no freaking way !
um excuse me ?
they finally just give me the $ _num_ to shut me up .
oh and btw everytime i was up there complaining - so was someone else .
idiots !
totally unimpressive .
i will not stay here again .
are nothing special either .
that 's the only good thing i can saw about the place .
i 'd never stay here again .
the show plays every _num_ minutes starting when the sun is down .
lame .
so we came back at 8:30 and the show lasted literally _num_ minutes .
check-in was terrible .
the man at the reception was not helpful at all .
maximum of _num_ seconds .
the next day , wynn still has no double rooms .
did any employee really care ?
not really .
the customer service is horrible .
called them _num_ times with _num_ min waiting time each .
all i need is just to send me the confirmation email .
poor service .
i was there at check-in time and my reserved room was not ready .
i would give _num_ stars if possible .
do not go to this hotel if you want to be safe .
if you want to be safe and secure , go elsewhere .
the room has _num_ full sized beds .
nope , not queen -- full beds .
come on , wynn , are you even trying ?
my friend could n't finish a basic blt sandwich even with her drunken appetite .
they do have quite an awesome ice machine though , like seriously legit .
how lame can you be ?
avoid .
i was so disappointed with my stay !
it was a no win situation for us at the wynn .
the slot machines are money hungry man eaters .
so they know and they do n't care cause they rather make money ?
cheap !
i stayed at the wynn for four nights last week .
keep in mind it was not that windy .
i was wondering why i was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes .
not a big deal if you are out all night partying .
anyways , i needed a statement copy so i went to registration to check-out .
another _num_ minutes wasted .
when it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill .
never to return again .
i do n't care for finding out .
appalling service .
so not impressed with this place .
must be nice to be have a _num_ star rating .
i could n't sleep at the wynn .
gambling sucks .
the wynn was not convenient for us .
the wynn sucks .
my husband and i went for a _num_ night getaway and were highly disappointed .
the staff was so useless and at times even rude .
they must not treat their employees well is all i can say .
i think they just got busy and gave our room away .
total lack of customer service .
expecting it to be on a par w/ the bellagio but it was n't .
they want to charge me to use the pool and wifi ?
the food sucks .
i get comped to eat these places and i never do .
the food sucks .
i stayed in their tower suites which are supposed to be the high end .
when we returned an hour or so later , still no bed .
no call back .
no call back .
_num_ minutes after that the bed arrived .
especially at the prices they charge here .
just wanted to remind everyone how bad this place is .
i never stayed at the hotel so i can not comment on the rooms .
if you go in from the main entrance they do n't pay attention .
i 'm not sure , when i went in i just kept on walking .
nobody stopped me .
this is a review of my gambling experience .
i got annoyed and left .
it was very disappointing .
bell man was not available at check in .
too many other issues to go into .
i will not be returning her again , not at these prices .
the expensive buffet says a lot too .
have not stayed at wynn but had a very negative experience in the casino .
will never step foot in wynn or encore again .
it was disgusting , to say the least .
shame on the wynn .
extremely pricey , rude security guards , super snotty casino dealers and staff .
that is totally a bs rule .
their buffet food was nasty .
the lobster was not fresh , the meat was soft and disgusting .
horrible !
towels took _num_ minutes as well !
$ _num_ worth of electronics and clothing were stolen from my room .
no explanation , nothing .
just ridiculous .
but do not run into any problems .
the people here seem to have pretty bad attitude towards their customers .
it was n't even _num_ hours before my keys stopped working .
i went to the front desk to get them fix which was fine .
my keys did n't work , so i went back again .
this whole ordeal stressed my wife out even more .
no fans or air conditioning in bathrooms .
you will sweat like a pig !
common areas = _num_ stars .
shops = _num_ stars .
checkin service = _num_ star .
i think _num_ months should be enough .
if you visit , stay out of trouble kids !
the pit just had no energy , blah .
but just ok .
you suck .
unhelpful , disrespectful , you get the point .
4pm though , really ?
seriously , how pathetic .
charge for getting another room card ?
i usually stay in vegas a min of twice a year .
i have suggested to everyone i know to take their money and class elsewhere .
it 's wasted on a dump like the wynn .
he should have been cut off from drinking and gambling .
this happened on the morning of september 25th , _num_ around 2am .
do not even stay here .
the worst treatment i have ever received .
the spa is terrible as is everything else .
it does not even deserve _num_ star .
so we arrived to our room and it was empty .
at this point were at _num_ hours in our room .
i also came home to another _num_ emails from them .
at first the wynn denied any knowledge of this email .
i do n't know why everybody likes the wynn ?
it 's vegas , we came here to party , not sleep at 9pm .
walls are paper thin , we heard our neighbors as they heard us .
i 'm disappointed , i would not book at the wynn again .
the hotel was nice , but rooms itself were not worth it .
i hate everything about the wynn .
they said they were sorry but you could tell they couldnt care less .
i would never go back again .
very rude staff .
long lines in check in and check out .
windows dirty in room and next to roof and was noisy .
been there a dozen times but they had no clue .
internet wifi was $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
ripoff like internet in rooms .
not good for five star hotel !
stayed here recently .
it small and not even that nice .
better off in the newer properties , cosmo , etc .
we recently stayed at the wynn hotel and experienced theft .
while the facility was lovely , this behavior is unacceptable .
shame on you , wynn .
front desk was not very helpful the person who took care of us .
not very good nothing was done to take care of the matter .
beware not the classy joint its advertised to be in my experience !
mind you i was checking out so i had all my bags .
that is about as bad as it gets .
the tv takes forever to get to the regular channels .
bottom line - not worth the money .
my recent stay at the wynn left me incredibly underwhelmed .
there were several problems during our stay .
i would have appreciated follow up from the hotel .
i called for service and a new remote was brought to our room .
i left my sweater in _num_ .
a $ _num_ rental fee for a refrigerator is ridiculous .
there are too many options on the strip to be so disappointed .
waited _num_ minutes in line just to check in .
others behind me waited over an hour just to get to the desk .
they told me to following instructions on the slot machine when using the card .
i thought that was rude as i know it didnt work .
there was a blue screen that would not turn off and no cable .
so would like others to see my review based on our stay .
the wynn is not worth the price .
- no coffee makers in room - - i like my morning coffee .
- drinks are outrageously expensive ( $ _num_ for a shot of bourbon ! )
and then there 's a $ _num_ tax on top of that .
in this day and age they charge $ _num_ ?
not so elsewhere in the hotel .
you ca n't accommodate _num_ people ?
they have the worst valet parking service ever !
yellow stands for , wait _num_ + minutes to get your car .
these valet workers made us wait _num_ minutes to get our car .
however , the service just did n't sit right with me from the beginning .
though inside , i was frustrated .
the front desk should be trained in a similar manner .
do not stay here .
service is awful .
the staff is beyond rude .
it was the most ignorant things i think i 've ever witnessed .
so annoying , but we did .
this time there not letting my friend into the pool cause of his tattoos !
we had to leave cause of the embarrassment .
the bottom line : if i could i would choose another hotel any time .
the cons : disclosure - i do not care for vegas .
but many of my problems with the wynn are specific .
second , the place stinks .
it is more than obvious this is what they were told to do .
but the hours are uncomfortable ( _num_ am - _num_ pm ) .
that is not enough .
furthermore , some of the comments were absurd .
i 'm not sure what that was about .
worse stay ever in vegas !
but my stay there was the worst time i have had in vegas .
i get in and it is packed as they didnt open the pool side .
wow ... worst hotel service ever .
it was laid out like bellagio and the service was equal to the bellagio .
but it did n't last .
the video blackjack machines were not setup to double down or split .
normally , it takes just a few minutes to get service .
two were there and they could not have cared less .
really noisy .
would n't recommend .
no dice .
she offered me ear plugs .
i 'm assuming the strip side does n't have the same problem .
my experience there at that time gave me an entire new perspective on vegas .
absolutely no support , and it felt so worn out !
the seating is weird .
there 's a long bench with three small tables on the other side .
not private , not romantic , and certainly not worth a $ _num_ meal .
too bad we will never be back !
the casino bartenders were great , we were never thirsty .
so , at 2am on sunday , we 'd had enough .
he took $ _num_ off of our dinner bill , but nothing more .
the worst part of this ?
i will never , but never ever , go there again .
the rooms were amazing best i have ever been in !
i will not come back .
a bartender said this was steve wynn 's idea .
i traveled to vegas for 4th of july weekend with a group .
this place is not worth the money .
we stayed in encore for two night .
definitely , it ' the worst one we ever stayed !
it 's not our , so disgusting !
but the next day no one contacted us , we call them again .
after a whole day waiting , no one called us .
how bad experience we met in encore !
not the clubs or restaurants .
we had _num_ suites for _num_ days each .
yes i know _num_ days in vegas ?
so why the _num_ star ?
we thought it was weird , considering we left them neat .
* while at our lily pad at encore beach club flip flops stolen .
lame , and we will not be returning !
hey wynn , what happens in vegas does n't stay in vegas anymore !
i went to this hotel to gamble and the staff was unbelievably rude .
to my disappointment , it 's not on par with my expectations .
it 's a long walk from the garage to registration .
i waited in line for about _num_ minutes just to check in .
he just did n't want to give it to us .
unbelievable to be experiencing these kind of things at a 5-star hotel .
anyways , after the blood stain incident , we got another room .
the hotel was not apologetic or anything .
i called a total of three times .
they at no point let me listen to the tape .
that is where i lost it .
our non-smoking room was completely fine and my oasis from the cigarette smell .
when i checked in for _num_ nights , i expected _num_ buffet coupons .
i was once again told nothing could be done .
there are no shortage of luxury hotels on the las vegas strip .
why bother with one that is willing to treat you so poorly ?
disappointed at d buffet for sure .
d food choices r plentiful but lack of quality .
no bourbon sauce for crepes , bread pudding .
i just checked in for a work function .
terribly disappointed with the bait and switch .
they get an f here .
using the tv to check out took too long .
and despite entering my email address , i never got a receipt .
annoying .
horrible customer service .
their customer service was really lacking this time !
next time i will stay somewhere else ... dont waste your vacation here !
everyone was rude .
not so much .
this is not `` _num_ star resort '' level customer service .
so i called the front desk to report this problem .
( my husband never had allergic reaction before ) .
so we may extend one more night of our stay in wynn .
but the truth is we reported the allergic reaction around _num_ am .
first off i feel very weird here .
and they do n't even try and hide it .
`` the cafe '' is really the opposite .
i 've been here over _num_ times .
i 've lost at least two thousand each time .
i 'm not coming back .
this casino takes ur money within _num_ min .
you never , never .
wynn did nothing .
i do n't care much for the dcor of wynn .
its was a surprisingly bad first impression .
why do you want to ruin our good mood over $ _num_ ?
nothing better or worse than the other great properties in vegas .
yea i 'll never stay here again !
okay i like to dance but not when i 'm trying to sleep .
hear is where it gets worse .
typically resorts get rating that high because the value the experience of their customers .
not the wynn !
simply ridiculous !
if not for that , i would give this place a five star rating .
the wynn needs to change their towels .
in other words , the concierge was useless .
i will not go back to wynn hotel .
i would never eat or stay at this hotel again .
outside of that i would never come here to gamble again .
the casino itself was small and the ceilings were very low .
the machines were high priced and paid out nothing .
not a good sports bar or dessert shop or nothing .
the shops were all empty and super high end .
why bother when no one is in your store .
a bunch of empty restaurants and shops .
lame !
we gave it _num_ stars only because it obviously was n't ghetto .
mr wynn , it 's time to fire your designer .
noisy .
really noisy !
i 'm not even going to go into how bad the service was .
my rating is for the customer service not the hotel .
country club at wynn not very good .
expect high prices in vegas , but this was just bland .
shrimp and grits bland an boring , porterhouse over cooked and not tasty .
terrible service.
just awful .
anywhere you want to go , you have to pass the nasty smoker smell .
do n't bring your kids here .
not after this time though .
they fed me some bs `` we had a medical emergency '' line .
i work at a hotel myself and know this is not the case .
it can not .
it 's not dye .
this was confirmed by lv as well .
i will not be patronizing this establishment anymore .
horrible customer service .
why is it my fault that your system was down ?
i spent hundreds up dollars that night gambling but that meant nothing .
disappointing ; overly crowded and pedestrian despite nice setting .
when we came , lines for checkin and taxis were endless .
pool was closed for maintenance with no head 's up or warning from staff .
gym not free for guests either , with its own charges .
would not return here .
the concierge did not seem to care about my concern .
the customer service was terrible .
i tried to use the printing station which did n't work .
my family have been loyal customers of wynn for many many years .
it 's been our favorite hotel until today .
the customer service at wynn lacks professionalism .
it was not worth any of it .
just to give justice to this experience , but i kept getting disappointed .
my family were disappointed .
we did n't even find anything special about this dinner experience .
but really , the overall verdict - christmas eve dinner fail .
probably not .
i wish i could give less then a _num_ .
horrible experience .
if you dont know you are out of luck .
i ca n't believe people pay to go to wynn .
do n't think we would stay here again and certainly would n't recommend it .
it was disappointing considering the price .
the internet is quite slow , but price is not low .
i feel like what i paid did not include anything except the room .
the only casino in vegas that does this .
- they handed a fake $ _num_ bill .
none of the slot machines accepted it either .
craps only allow 2x odds now .
$ _num_ limit , double odds .
the slot machines just were n't paying out at all .
- yes , check your snacks .
the boxes were open and eaten without it being removed from the tray .
according to the front desk , the door was not closed all the way .
there is a cafe downstairs while encore does not .
worse was the front desk attitude towards it .
they insisted it was consumed !
i would not stay here again .
i was so fucking stupid to choose this hotel .
the restaurants are all grossly overpriced .
the food was prepared poorly , and our bill was almost $ _num_ .
what a terrible way to end our stay .
literally from starting at midnight to _num_ am .
will not be coming back to this expensive hotel .
second , the $ _num_ charge for calls and internet ?
better yet , _num_ minutes after we left !
i ordered two sodas to go - two minutes tops .
are you kidding me ?
even my kids were completely embarrassed .
mr. steve wynn , please address this issue asap .
extremely bad service .
i had asked housekeeping twice to service our room but to no avail .
overall , a very disappointing experience .
then refused to get me to a hospital .
ate at one of their restaurants and had a bad experience .
left a bad yelp review for the restaurant .
next day they call and say sorry there is nothing they will do .
they would have been better off to ignore the original review .
this is when reputation management goes wrong folks .
real wrong .
when we were walking around the buffet there was n't many options .
no raw oysters and only _num_ rolls of sushi to pick from .
my cousin and i went for the crab legs and prime rib .
we both got really sick and threw up all night .
my wife and i stayed at the wynn tower suites for _num_ nights .
this was the worst hotel experience i have ever had .
the night manager could not fix the situation .
in short we were not able to sleep at all that night .
for $ _num_ a night i was charged including tax i expected much more .
i wo n't stay here ever again .
a little pricey but you get what you paid for .
however that is where i great the problem .
now to the bad .
it was not done .
_num_ ) i asked a few weeks after i checked out for my bill .
to my surprise for _num_ of the rooms , i charge for the snacks .
he had no explanation for the lack of hotel security either .
however , i gave it _num_ stars because of the noise .
we saw the same charge on our credit card after we checked out .
he might be having a bad mood and was being very impatient .
that was very very very rude .
that 's not the case at all .
the red card station attendants are the exact same way .
the room service food is awful i 've had better at luxor .
i never in a million years expected this from a _num_ diamond resort .
for my money i would redo this trip and stay at bellagio .
i do n't know what they could do to make this better .
all and all we are beyond disappointed with the experience .
if you want to sleep at night do n't stay here !
neither my husband or i got any sleep that night !
horrible !
horrible !
the receptionist was rude !
she just said it 's a request and not a guarantee .
non-smoking is also a request and not a guarantee .
really , i do n't want your refund of the extra money i paid .
it ruined my vacation .
bad service .
will not come back again .
the receptionist ( lindsay ) was horrible and rude .
she did not care about the customers at all .
she just did n't want to work .
all she told you was that they did not have what you reserved .
the manger on duty has the same bad attitude .
horrible .
service is bad .
services is worse than a motel .
i will not go back again .
they will not give you what you reserved !
i really do n't understand why do we need to reserve then !
i 'm giving _num_ stars based on their _num_ star buffet and awesome area .
until now i 've never stayed at the wynn .
but i 'm here with some friends that staying in the salon suite .
it 's now past the check in time and still nothing from the wynn .
instead we keep getting told _num_ minutes on four different times .
just be straight up ... do n't jack us around wynn .
the service is so bad !
however , i wait _num_ minutes but no one is here .
the angry thing is the key does n't work again !
so , i took another _num_ minutes wait to enter my room !
also , the rest of the staff was very rude .
no tank tops .
( he really didnt care .
he was rude and extremely unhelpful .
all of which were completely unacceptable .
rude , obnoxious and shady people manage this place .
wynn sucks .
will not stay here again , gamble here again or party here again .
the $ _num_ beer had at least _num_ inches of foam on top .
if the customer comes first you may want to remind your staff .
besides that all was _num_ stars minimum .
overall the hotel handled the situation terribly ... .
very racist hotel !
five stars hotel become no star !
we wish we can give zero star for this review !
i was so wrong !
plus $ _num_ casino credit .
could not see going in the hot season .
same $ _num_ price with a a $ _num_ credit .
wow i would honestly expected coming from nyc i would get better service .
this is my last trip here until there is a smoke free casino .
buffett was beyond over priced .
food at buffett was not worth the price in any way .
$ _num_ a person is fraud for the poor variety and selection .
was there for _num_ minutes while she was doing her computer work .
ive never had to go thru this with any hotel ive ever checked in .
the room was not anything big at all .
worst experience .
the service is lacking .
the dealers were okay but nothing to write home about .
i would not recommend the wynn to anyone .
this place is not what it used to be .
really sad what it has become .
worst customer service ever .
i did n't even get a reason on why they do n't do this .
every other casino bar i 've gone into not affiliated with wynn does .
i 've never stayed here due to the over priced rooms .
it was very busy & moving slow .
worst casino in vegas .
worst customer service in the vegas area !
i would rate this as a zero if i could .
this place sure has went downhill over he years .
very dated .
_num_ bucks gone in less than _num_ minutes .
did n't even really get any game play .
let me be up a little and then let me be down a little .
i guess it 's safe to say u wo n't be back for awhile .
i threw my red card away .
as expected , the casino is smoking .
not pleasant .
what a waste of $ _num_ a night .
they were insulting stating , `` well , it is expensive here '' .
long story short , we have continued to be charged after our stay .
be sure you sign and make copies of all documents .
just spent a while playing poker my wife played slots slots .
currently staying at the wynn in las vegas .
bad service if you can find a waiter at all .
i have n't found anything that was good here .
disgusting !
such a shame !
this `` make it difficult to uber passengers '' is getting old .
extremely rude employees !
avoid it !
i went to the front desk begging them to give me a new key .
these people do n't care to listen either .
am i supposed to sit on the carpet ?
sleep on the carpet , what other solution is there ?
i 'm never going to spend another dime on this hotel .
i 'm not upset , i 'm just really disappointed .
the casino is not family friendly .
however , we did n't receive any of this due to black out dates .
overall , my experience was disappointing .
i called wynn and filed a request .
after _num_ weeks i get a response saying it is not there .
what a shame !
i ca n't believe that wynn encore employees actual steal stuff .
very disappointed with hotel policy and response !
never again there .
$ _num_ a night for a roll away bed !
i am a las vegas local and was appalled by this policy .
needless to say , i will never go to another wynn property .
purchase tickets for a concert for encore online .
* shops are very pushy for a close .
* wife likes the slot machines at this casino , thus we stayed here .
this room was not being used .
i 'm so disappointed in what is suppose to be such an upscale facility .
you 've already prepaid and ca n't just check out and go somewhere else .
i paid a higher price for a nicer place and did n't get it .
so disappointed wynn .
food is over priced , drinks are over priced .
restaurants were half empty when we went to eat .
the wanted to charge $ _num_ to use the gym , who does that ?
or pay $ _num_ for a bowl of noodles at the wynn .
i had a two months old baby with me , what do they expect ?
we stayed at this hotel twice , and never experience anything bad about it .
so i am force to call them to meet us downstairs .
my recent visit was terrible .
in the end , this casino is just overrated , nothing special about it .
but when we went to gamble the dealers had absolutely no personality whatsoever .
our first morning , christmas eve , we ordered room service .
about an hour and a half later , i got sick .
every 30-45 mins i was getting sick .
so my husband went downstairs to look for security .
they were accommodating enough to send ginger ale up to our room .
after an hour of not feeling any better , i called them .
the next morning the operations manager called to check on me .
which is very unfortunate because again , we are on our honeymoon .
that resort fee was n't as much as the room service food cost .
long story short we never intend to stay there again .
and neither do my in-laws who have stayed at and loved the wynn .
which is a shame because it really is a beautiful place .
unfortunately , that was the past and this is now .
this is where it gets interesting ; and utterly unacceptable .
speaking to a supervisor changed nothing .
regardless , my main problem was with my room .
housekeeping standards are far below to any steve wynn property .
obviously she was n't trained on hospitality .
apparently it 's no longer in fashion in this hotel .
there was only one thing that was as expected and that was rooms service .
i had a terrible experience staying here .
still okay here , the thing that got me was the casino staff .
the staff was unfriendly , i would get asked for an id everywhere .
even in the toilet i get id .
people who check you in are not friendly , at all .
this resort is a total zero .
staff / management could care less ... .
very unprofessional and very rude .
way too long a wait and too many other hotels to choose from .
will not be back .
the room service is so so , bacon in particular is a little lackluster .
ordered atleast _num_ things with bacon over course of _num_ days .
taking my money across the street for the rest of the trip .
both encore which i stayed at and wynn are horrible .
what is wrong with these people .
nice hotel but so many things that could be better .
starting with the rooms , they do not match the rest of the hotel .
not very comfortable at all .
i know it 's vegas but some sleep would be nice .
even the downtown casinos have better odds .
that does n't even remotely make sense .
i told him no where on the letter did the offer state this .
the room was nice and comfy , employees were professional , except one place .
no fridge and a coffee maker in the room .
it took _num_ medicine to make me feel better .
its simple and quick and i would gladly pay for it .
so ... how does a first class establishment ... sink to such a low ?
the only thing that saved the day was the gracious and professional wait staff !
a hotel is first and foremost a place to sleep .
a building with no beds is not a hotel .
ridiculous right ?
just spent _num_ nights .
they comped me _num_ bucks .
i wo n't come back .
no comps .
casino host was rude .
that totally ruined our dinner .
not to mention we had to explain to our son what just happened .
that was a very bad experience and for such a fine establishment like wynn .
a hotel is first and foremost a place to sleep .
a building with no beds is not a hotel .
ridiculous right ?
you and the management can fuck yourselves !
it has been closed for a long time .
what an ordeal !
worker : let me check the milk .
got into the parking garage but no luck finding a parking space .
i probably could have parked at the venetian but , oh well .
then again , so does the sahara .
ugh .
the main reason for the ugh is the parking situation here .
the place has long , dim , dark hallways leading to meeting rooms .
really needs improving ... .
i was there for a _num_ day conference .
there was no window and so no ventilation .
of course , no one seems to care .
absolutely no concern which is why the thieves get away with it .
the count `` hell '' the douche bag is a more fitting description .
has anyone ever seen this guy do any actual car work ?
parking for the showroom is atrocious if busy .
the merchandise for sale is way overpriced .
i went on the website and in their cover page it said counts tours .
paid a $ _num_ per person and saw nothing .
would not recommend this place at all .
yeah no thanks .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
so , the _num_ stars i gave this place is solely for the food .
no bueno !
yes i know it is las vegas .
it still does n't excuse this place for selling horrible tasting food .
the noodles were disgusting .
even my girlfriend tried it and said it was gross .
my girlfriend ordered blackened chicken with veggies and rice .
the chicken was ok but again , no flavor .
this place is gross .
this is by far the worse chinese food i 've ever had .
i was sad that i threw $ _num_ away .
sample your food before you buy it people .
it was seedy , dirty and the `` complimentary '' lotion was used !
i also wore flip flops in the shower .
it was not worth the money .
everything was horrible .
it 's not that hard to get it right !
the only thing my mom and i ate was the watermelon .
$ _num_ for watermelon ?
it really was terrible .
i would have given negative stars if possible .
steak and eggs were not satisfying and not worth the money .
not going to back there again !
it was not the best .
two of the tables stayed dirty for the entire hour we were there .
our server brought us _num_ oz .
glasses of our chosen beverage .
however , after the first _num_ minutes of our meal he disappeared .
if he went off shift they never replaced our server .
the selection is extremely limited .
the hot sides were not any better .
the macaroni and cheese was unappealing .
however , most of the salads were old as well as the condiments .
to top it off the dressings were very messy .
it was cheap we had a buy one get one coupon .
i 'd avoid it if possible .
terrible .
breakfast buffet for only $ _num_ ?
too bad the food was a great failure !
none of it really looked appealing .
but everything else was too salty to eat at some point .
avoid the breakfast buffet at all costs .
stick to another casino on the strip for breakfast .
makes hometown buffet taste like a gourmet _num_ star meal !
i 'll prefer any airlines food over this crap !
nasty , stinky & has lots of shit on the floor , literally .
i would go just so i could watch this circus !
after ordering , our drinks appeared quickly .
our food took almost _num_ minutes to arrive , and was disappointing .
the bacon was weird .
the only reason this place is getting _num_ stars is the service .
i just wish she had the opportunity to serve a better product .
the bar is also not far away as well .
that 's not to say that this place is n't deserving of any stars .
no thank you .
flat screen tv , tidy rooms , and clean .
it was n't bad , just getting to the room made you feel nervous .
if i had to , i would book a room there , again .
no problem with reservations or check out .
i used to like this stop to get fuel on my way through here .
had to cancel my reservation _num_ hours in advance of the date of arrival .
one star is really pushing it .
for starters , the place was filthy .
none of them .
i asked what a few things were , and the staff did n't know .
it really was that bad .
no smiles .
no joking around .
the food at the cafe and buffet made me gag .
the gaming sucked pretty much .
no such thing .
missed the buffet because of it .
bed had no blanket , just sheets .
in the room , the clock radio did n't work .
terrible 's hotel , terrible indeed .
food is bomb tho .
they do n't call terrible place terrible you 're no reason .
service is bad .
the name says it all : this place is pretty terrible .
i ca n't even imagine how bad that could be .
this was our last stop on the tour .
not that we will ever use the player 's club card again , however !
everyone else had a _num_ in a paper bag in their hand !
i 'd sum up the whole experience in one word : terrible .
the elevators and halls smelled of smoke .
in fact , were charged an extra $ _num_ per room for this .
this place sucks for non smokers !
it is small and stinks to high heaven from the smoke .
however , did n't get much from this hotel .
during check it , does n't feel welcomed at all .
the only thing that taste okay was scramble eggs .
during checkout , i told the clerk about my breakfast experience .
absolute worst .
worst stay in a hotel i have ever experienced .
the bad ! ''
the worst thing was the service in the cafe .
we tried the buffet the first night , and did not return .
this is n't to say that everything was bad .
avoid the buffet if you expect a decent selection .
i was seriously disappointed .
i did n't know the hotel would hold _num_ dollars on my card !
then after i checked out , she told me i owed _num_ dollars .
took _num_ days for my money to come back to my account .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
absolutely the worst experience ever .
omg this place is so bad !
it 's almost offensive that this is how they reward their loyal guests !
we were packing up to leave vegas and needed to get an early brunch .
but it was pretty bad .
the beef brisket ranged from charcoal to gritty fat .
just a bad experience .
but i brushed it off , which may have been a huge mistake .
there was a screw driver left in the room .
seriously everything was sooo unappetizing .
it was definitely nothing special .
slow , slow , slow , slow service .
i split the mac n cheese with my friend and it was super good .
the worst salmon i 've ever had .
the service was garbage .
the restaurant was dirty and again ... the worst salmon i 've ever had .
i 'll have to give two thumbs down in a _num_ rotation .
other than that , this is a so so restaurant .
it was very dead so i cant say much about the atmosphere .
maybe it gets better at night who knows ?
anyways , i believe i had their mac and cheese and buffalo wings ?
but eh , i would n't come here again .
if you are on a budget then you may want to avoid this one .
i made a terrible mistake .
the sandwich was too small for $ _num_ .
i chose the `` smothered fries '' which had bacon and cheese on them .
way too much money .
she did n't even know the words .
very annoying .
it was so annoying to eat with this waitress walking around being so irritating .
check your check cause they will make up prices .
food was bad .
been here _num_ times and in last _num_ months .
my wife who loves chicken wings has not finished her order twice .
first time we ordered them fried , dry dry dry .
second time grilled , dry dry dry .
the friends we dined with said the same comment , average food .
nothing to write home about .
well i want to start by saying my rating for this restaurant is misleading .
this was the worst experience i have ever had at a restaurant .
i dont like to send food back to the kitchen .
that is restaurant _num_ .
i hate writing bad reviews but the food is pretty bad .
not as well done as i had asked .
no napkins in the bag .
the service took forever , prices are ridiculous , and the food kinda sucks .
my advice , do n't waste your money here .
well i can not say that i would recommend this place to anyone .
the waiter we had was really rude and did not smile once .
not only was it him but none of the employees acted happy .
and it 's not like the food made up for any of it all .
i was cold inside wearing a jacket and it was over _num_ degrees outside .
the only highlight of my whole visit was the music .
very sad .
they took my lifetime membership away and now the food is turning to garbage .
she even went as far as to tell us what to write .
the food was ok , nothing to write home about .
the meal was spoiled by the regular survey questions from our server .
$ _num_ , for a hamburger ?
and right there i just lost it !
smell bad , toilet paper everywhere .
expensive !
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
the staff there is so unprofessional and rude its ridiculous .
if the dryer does n't work they wo n't refund your money .
stay clear of this place its horrible !
but that 's not as bad as the apartment itself .
the toilets do n't work half the time .
the internet is slow and works maybe if your lucky half the time .
well i guess it 's crappy service from a crappy apartment .
it 's _num_ , not _num_ when the apartment was made .
worse move of my life !
the tv 's are terrible .
still listed in yellow pages , but the building is abandoned .
totally disappointed with the shoe department here .
_num_ star for the massive dressing rooms .
i would have given no stars if i could .
i had the worst experience i have ever had in any department store .
i came in and it was in august , around my birthday .
it was a splurge ... it was $ _num_ .
well , that is so not what happened .
so , at this point i 'm in tears .
she refuses to do anything and is treating me like a criminal .
are you kidding me ?
it just seemed so shady , and absurd !
anyway , i 'm not rich .
$ _num_ gone .
i clearly would never return to this saks , ever again .
worst customer service experience ever !
i refuse to even go in there .
bad customer service at the shoe department .
not : `` how may i help you ?
so i left and bought my shoes elsewhere .
terrible customer service .
this is why i buy everything online .
terrible customer service .
needless to say they need to work on customer service .
terrible experience here .
went here to go buy my prom dress , had a very high budget .
it arrived fast , in _num_ days .
i will not be returning .
the worst saks ever .
not enough selection .
all the employees there dress terribly .
lastly , it has no class at all .
avoid this place .
you 'll regret coming here .
horrible .
i wo n't be back .
i did not find out why until recently .
my friends and i normally stop in the area and visit all four bars .
if you do go visit the area be very careful where you park .
i recently visited roman times when on vacation in las vegas .
no one acknowledged me as i come in .
roman times needs to work on their professionalism and customer service .
horrible place ever .
this shop is just want to make money .
so i paid in full and asked to ship it to me .
so i paid in full and wait for the watch happily .
i was quit confused about that and i tried it on myself .
it was _num_ inches longer .
i recieved a wrong item and i had to pay for their fault .
it does n't make sense for me .
next he turned up the music so i could not hear my boss talking .
he demanded i buy a watch or leave .
finally he insulted my t-shirt as being ugly .
run away and keep your money .
the second signage is up , but with no power .
well , i got busy and no one came for that matter .
no one should wait that long for a quote .
pretty bad experience .
_num_ days later it was complete ( no biggie , stuff happens ) .
except for the fact when it was finally finished , it was done wrong .
tina said `` no problem , we will make a new one '' .
tina does n't respond to emails unless it 's for an order .
i was excited to see the $ _num_ steak special .
stepping in , this place had that dive seedy feel to it .
_num_ minutes ?
low and behold , the food was cold !
rubber cold eggs .
my medium steak was so overcooked , i thought i was chewing cardboard .
we all had maybe _num_ bites of our food and we just gave up .
worse thing ( well personally ) .
i was too fed up to deal with this place to argue the case .
they just left .
another table straight up skipped out after a waiting .
not even on a drunk hunger driving night in vegas .
i ordered a sandwich here and it was n't very good .
ellis island was old and smoky as all hell .
however , the service was abysmal .
we had wings for appetizers - ok , nothing to rave about .
definitely a hole in the wall .
the dj 's are always rude .
umm ... no .
let me tell you why we 'll never go there again !
* our waitress took forever and was not that helpful .
our waitress never checked on us , and we were ready to go .
we waited and looked around as she never showed up again .
our experience there was unbelievable .
in the worst way .
i ca n't believe we walked all that way for nothing .
ugh .
did i miss anything ?
yes - they have that old style vegas feel ... .
if you like your clothes smelling like a cigarette factory ... .
if you like bathrooms that look they were cleaned a month ago ... .
if you like a security service that is totally useless ... .
well big joe , you were wrong .
i guess i 'm used to getting the check before i 'm done eating .
_num_ stars for this place ?
at most they deserve at _num_ .
i was disappointed by the food and the restaurant .
it 's not worth the wait at all .
the wait staff are nice though ... _num_ stars for the friendly waitress .
the bar and tables are cheap , so no problem there .
here 's my problem : the karaoke mc is a douche .
tried hitting up the bbq spot and the restaurant .
they open at 4pm no one under _num_ allowed , no exceptions .
i should mention the ribs are baby back ribs .
the bbq chicken was moist , the sauce was good .
there was no smoke ring on the meat of the ribs .
did the meat fall off the bone ?
yes , but it was n't legit bbq chicken .
the corn on the cobb was limp .
two stars for being fake bbq .
i was truly disappointed .
that should have been a sign that things was not the same .
prime rib was plain .
too bad .
for the price , i 'm really not impressed with it .
not good .
they are not even # _num_ on their block .
that being said , the steak i got with my dinner was terrible .
it was quite dry and not all that tasty .
i would never step foot into this joint ever again .
tonight it was a big miss !
i unfortunately got really sick after eating my steak with food poisoning symptoms .
barely anyone was there probably just _num_ small parties .
finally we decided to just eat it , leave and never return .
no bbq after 10pm .
not our favorite .
the stout : forgettable .
iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing .
came with stale looking buns .
the potatoes were most likely instant .
sleazy old style vegas for you , i suppose .
the service reeked of crap !
it may be cheap but frustration is the worst .
nasty food !
well you guys failed us .
the beer it came with tasted stale and watered down .
i literally have nothing positive to say about this place .
i hate mcdonalds but would have preferred it over this junk .
and do n't even get me started about the service .
long story short : only come here if you hate yourself .
forgettable .
only reason i would try again .
needless to say , we all walked out .
not a good think when you are allergic to cigarette smoke .
that is no way to treat a customer !
the ipa is a new brew i was not expecting to find .
he quickly said , `` i do n't think it 's strong enough . ''
it 's cheap though , only $ _num_ a pint .
_num_ 1/2 hour dinner , _num_ he before drinks served .
yikes , it 's not that good .
the $ _num_ steak was tough .
i would not like to walk to ellis island due to the iffy neighborhood .
we were advised that their bbq ribs were to die for .
nothing special .
by far the absolute worst `` steak '' i 've ever had .
the green beans were soggy .
bad food is one thing , bad service makes it so much worse .
i could n't tell if the waitress hated her customers or her life more .
there were only about _num_ tables occupied .
$ _num_ for steak , shrimp and potato .
the steak was a bit overcooked and tough , and the rest was unremarkable .
its an eight dollar steak .
i went back on a sober day and it was a big mistake .
i wish i would have kept that idea in my mind .
the _num_ star idea .
why do n't you taste the same ?
this was the cause for me giving them _num_ stars before .
pros : open _num_ hours .
you are that friend i will not really talk to anymore .
i thought wrong .
i was actually a little disappointed mainly with their service more then food .
not just once , but twice !
very disappointing .
they had this weird setup where even though their tables were clean and empty .
parties had to wait about _num_ to _num_ mins before getting a table !
and that confused me alot .
the meatballs were not that great either but the pasta was ok .
avoid it if you can .
ill go back for the food .
their kitchen was closed for cleaning last night at _num_ so no prime rib .
but that did n't stop any of us .
awesome deal , but if only the quality was as good as the price .
ca n't have the bet of both worlds right ?
a bit watered down and lacked salt , but not too bad .
in conclusion , get their mashed potatoes .
everything else sucks .
i 'm torn with how many stars i should give this place .
the amber is my favorite ... the light beer is not all that great .
also , they have a restaurant and a metro pizza in the casino .
the sound quality is absolutely ridiculous .
they have probably the smallest karaoke song selection i 've ever seen .
i was there _num_ hours and sang _num_ songs .
no , then you need to leave '' .
service was slow !
remember folks , there 's a reason the steak special is $ _num_ .
cheap food cheap quality and bad service !
i will not be back .
ugly ribs .
not worth the effort .
terrible service , food was n't even decent , prices were average .
everyone was falling asleep !
_num_ steak and eggs .
my steak and the rest of my friends steak were not cooked to order .
my wife was craving for chicken fried steak for a while .
so , we got there around 8:30 pm .
she did n't even entertained us .
i stood and she gave me a number .
we had to wait for another _num_ minutes before our order came .
we 'll , the chicken fried steak looks big and looks delicious .
my order was horrible .
it 's so hard and burnt .
i could cook my steak better than this cook here .
this place is the worst place i 've ever been to vegas .
i would never come back to this place again ... never !
the place was cramped , with tables crowded against each other .
ordered the $ _num_ filet steak deal .
however , the bar had a _num_ drink minimum even for the designated driver .
very poor service from waitresses on the floor and bar .
even though i was tipping ( for soda ) at first .
there was a big long booth and _num_ tables open ?
a _num_ rating would be appropriate .
is there less than one star ?
no way for me to pull that one out of the bag .
it just was n't that much to ask .
cheap beers is the main reason to come here ... i think ?
i do n't have a reason to go back .
trashy casino slightly off the strip .
the food was nothing to write home about , very standard .
metro pizza is _num_ for _num_ large pizza 's on sundays .
there is however , no place to sit and eat your pizza .
the service and the drinks however ... left a lot to be desired .
in fact calling them mixed drinks is an insult to mixed drinks .
no hint of alcohol in the slightest .
when she returned again , i told her that the drink was still horrible .
i did n't want it .
she did and mostly avoided our table the rest of the evening .
nothing i would worry about getting again but not the worst i ever had .
ellis island , you are dead to me !
oh ellis island , i have been a fan for over _num_ years .
but no more !
really , a security guard ?
i told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable .
he got even closer to me and yelled , `` no ! ''
we then walked out , while the manager continued to yell at us .
um , not for us , sorry .
contacted by a marketing person from ellis island for more info about the incident .
i responded ... then never heard another word .
really think they do not care about customer service .
clearly enough people show up for the cheap food .
whatever ... just sad .
they also messed up on an order for the bbq chicken sandwich .
this gentlemen was supposed to get a whole and they made him a half .
they could not come up to me to apologize or face me in person .
they have no reason to call me a liar .
$ _num_ for a _num_ ounce beer ?
hell yes .
went to the karaoke bar and the service was terrible .
embarrassing for las vegas .
what the hell , yelpers !
but i could n't get past how amazingly terrible this place was !
so we wait about _num_ minutes before we 're finally seated .
so i was unsure as to why we waited _num_ minutes for a table .
we were starving at this point .
except , my knife could barely cut through my steak .
but i was definitely not satisfied .
what 's terrible here ?
just disappointed all around .
just do n't expect me to come around again .
people that rate this place high are cheap !
it 's a $ _num_ steak with slow service to say the least !
bottom line you get what you pay for !
but yelp , you are wrong .
so very wrong .
the amount of homeless people laying around outside was appalling .
the whole experience was depressing .
this is where vegas visitors go to cry in their drinks .
no idea how this place gets such high ratings .
i was like , why do you need to know that ?
terrible service .
ugh .
we 're waiting there for at least _num_ minutes .
about another _num_ minutes pass with still no one coming to the players desk !
you 've lost several hundred dollars today .
we went to terrible 's casino and spent our money there .
screw you ellis island , you useless incompetent jerks !
so it is n't even on it 's way yet ?
meatballs were n't bad , but nobody wants soggy pizza .
i was not a fan .
too bad the rest of the experience was bad .
he suggested ellis island casino , which brews its own beer onsite .
which was a good idea , because the beer was a disappointment .
rather , it was just flavorless .
this was a better choice , but still just an average stout at best .
acceptable , but nothing to write home about .
but the beer was disappointing .
i ordered it anyway with instruction that bacon not be brought out .
the second beer i ordered was the ipa .
they are slowly starting to go downhill .
this lounge used to be divey , smokey , crowded , awesome !
karaoke _num_ nights a week !
gross .
two words : food poisoning .
it 's just not worth it anymore .
if there were zero stars , that is what i would have selected .
the staff however , is horrible .
i would never return here based on the rudeness of their staff .
much to my disappointment it was below mediocre .
my steak came in hard , dry , and close to leather .
now mind you , this is already _num_ minutes into the meal .
when i got to my second group , i noticed very very angry faces .
i was appalled so much i almost did n't believe it .
what the hell !
should n't be that way .
i was alone and on foot so it was intimidating .
i would n't go back here .
well the days of dining with celebrities here are long gone .
let 's flash ahead _num_ plus years to my current review .
the staff was slow and seemed bored with their jobs .
$ _num_ steak and eggs ?
the steak was too dry .
the worst part is the asshole security guy who was rude to me .
am i coming back here ?
i want to give this place zero stars .
it 's no different than ketchup or steak sauce .
there is no excuse for them to be charging for salsa .
they have gone down in hospitality .
have not been back since the food inspection noted on november _num_ .
this was our first stop this past weekend .
the place was pretty empty when we got there , around 4pm on friday .
pretty easy , _num_ minutes and i was done .
i was expecting a $ _num_ steak and eggs as other yelpers mentioned .
went here with _num_ people and they said they could not accommodate us .
this place was half full many empty tables but the could n't help us .
it was ridiculous .
but it should be expected from a shabby place like this off the strip .
this is the first time i have been disappointed after checking yelp .
i recommend u do n't go with a big group .
terrible for groups .
do n't believe me ?
really ?
i could n't believe they would treat a customer like that .
can you imagine how nasty the kitchen is ?
anyways , it 's just bad news all around .
not cool even if it was management .
disgusting !
pork chop with eggs was dry .
do n't care to go back .
this is a horrible place .
if your not a regular , you will be skipped several .
several regulars went before us _num_ times before our group went once .
all also had a slightly off aftertaste .
i had to leave , and i definitely would n't recommend coming back .
you had me at $ _num_ when we met in _num_ .
they no longer have steak and eggs for $ _num_ !
we walked out !
i am so mad !
there was n't so we got to dine here .
terrible service , condescending and rude management on duty .
do not come here if you can avoid it !
do n't go here if you have kids .
everything else is legal in nevada except this .
but still , _num_ mins ?
so i ordered the $ _num_ steak and eggs , medium well .
quick tip : way too far to walk from central strip .
and went for the _num_ steak + beer .
i probably would not come back unless i was lit .
i really do n't remember much from that night .
i do remember drinking many beers there though .
it is connected to a super _num_ motel or a hotel _num_ .
i know there is an _num_ in the name .
you do n't need to know the hotel name anyways .
they also have some slot machines like every other building in this city .
there is also a very small metro pizza location there .
it is a very old place and the decor is out dated .
i also had scrambled eggs , country potatoes , and toast .
now in new york you can get breakfast 24/7 , no problem .
ca n't mess that one up .
it was n't that the food tasted bad , but was not enjoyable .
the charm wore off .
it looked run down , maybe a little bit dirty .
they could n't tell me that before i completed the requirements for some reason .
an hour and a half wait to be seated for mediocre food .
not happening in this lifetime .
an hour long wait on a saturday night for sub par food .
i do n't know , i had the dry chicken and portobello mushrooms .
worst restaurant ever !
never mind the service is slow , the food was not worth the wait .
this place is terrible .
tvs everywhere but they have the same game on repeat sets .
cafe was almost empty and we still has a _num_ min wait .
service is terrible .
horrible service and the food is hit and miss .
he should n't be working in the industry .
they are slowly starting to go downhill .
the kicker is that the bbq cafe was half empty .
i grabbed an ipa which was disappointing .
not worth the walk .
i never in my life had a horrible experience like yesterday on easter .
he explained the kitchen can handle tickets greater than _num_ .
thanks for nothing mike .
needless to say we did not eat there and will never return .
if i could give no stars i would .
awful , just awful .
i asked for a booth and was shown a table .
so back to the waiting area where i was completely ignored .
we 're hungry and pissed off .
do n't waste your time .
but than again it 's cheap and you get what you pay for .
i 'm never going there again.
i will never come to this place again after tonight .
very rude .
i been here for the past _num_ years .
no thanks .
ellis island used to have a nice outdoor bbq restaurant .
the restaurant is so small that it fills up almost instantly .
sad to say , i wo n't waste my time or money here anymore .
quite possibly , no , absolutely the worst brewery i have ever visited .
the ipa and hefeweizen were mediocre to poor .
i had to go look for someone to ask them for a box .
the last _num_ visits have been very frustrating .
i only have a few moments to tell you how horrible this place is .
budget food restaurant with some good deals and bad deals .
a regular restaurant would charge twice what ellis charges .
our third meal went pretty badly .
the chicken parmesan was extra salty , the pasta was way overcooked and soggy .
everything else is n't worth the money , effort , or calories .
the service was so slow !
then another _num_ minutes until our food was delivered !
the chicken salad is also enough for two people .
he also had the quesadilla , that was o.k .
too .
so she took it off the bill for us .
do n't think we will be back here on purpose any time soon .
it was the only time in weeks it was out of my sight .
unfortunately , management could have cared less .
no such luck .
one star since i ca n't give zero .
what was horrible was their service .
the waitress said it was impossible and could not be done .
if we figured it out ourselves they would only split it in half .
never going back .
the worst management i have ever seen .
do not park a motorcycle in their parking structure .
i will never spend another penny at this place .
this place is rude !
_num_ smile , she had none !
_num_ follow ups , which she failed hard !
being a server that could perform is not easy which she totally failed .
i walked out after waiting _num_ minutes .
not worth it .
zero star .
this place is aweful , everything about it was horrible !
how wrong we were .
pbr would have tasted better !
it pains me to write this review .
it 's a pure crap shoot here .
ive seen lucky people at tables next to me get their food as ordered .
but they either do n't or just do n't care .
after a few minutes she comes out with _num_ au jus and no horseradish .
she comes back with _num_ packs of relish .
these people need some serious training and quality control .
will not be coming back and suggest you do the same .
a few of them ordered the same thing as me .
our server did n't even ask us once if everything is okay .
i hate this place .
the worst thing is that he did n't even apologize !
my eggs were cold and his steak was very salty .
the waitress was nice , but she was busy helping other tables .
we are not coming back .
gone in here to grab a few cocktails after work .
very small , smokey casino .
everything was wrong .
even the virgin drink i ordered had alcohol and i should sue .
ca n't even scramble eggs .
terrible food and mediocre service .
but than again it 's cheap and you get what you pay for .
i 'm never going there again.
beers are worse than anything i ever tested .
i ordered chicken , which is too dry to chew .
good place , affordable prices but the wait to get in is ridiculous .
i arrived only to find out that the barbecue is only served after _num_ .
the fried chicken was very good , however not worth the _num_ minute wait .
the biggest problem was the service .
so waiting for hours meant nothing .
the worst .
so disappointing .
wo n't return again .
you are way off the strip and next to a motel _num_ .
the entire place is just old , stinky and trashy .
just no .
but no more !
special is not that good service is rude they want to rush you .
the reason i hear is they are short on servers .
not the way to treat new customers .
there too many places in vegas to eat to put up with this bull .
would not recommend this place to anyone .
_num_ hr wait .
sitting here and there are _num_ empty dirty tables .
we went to ellis island on our last visit to vegas .
it was near our timeshare and the menu looked good online .
with so many restaurants in vegas , i wish we had gone somewhere else .
i wish i would have got lunch , the french fries look good .
here , the customer has no chance to be right .
told other customers that i did not tip enough .
even the security officer that knows me was confused and shocked .
he could not .
this is wrong .
this place does not care about locals .
love the casino but the karaoke bar was a bit of a hot mess !
they might have good food but i will never go back to find out !
unfortunately they ran out of the prime rib before we got there .
we ordered the new york strip , baked potato and shrimp .
cost was $ _num_ .
there was too much dressing on the salad .
it tasted so much of anchovies i could n't eat it .
the potato was warm not hot so the butter did n't melt well .
why is it this establishment can not make their food available to everyone ?
they have officially lost a loyal customer .
had a bad experience there for dinner .
poor experience from one hostess .
will not go back .
just my opinion from _num_ visit .
i 'm thinking we should have came for dinner for there famous ribs ... .
i have to say this place was nothing special .
yea that 's gon na be a no for me dog .
just ate breakfast there and everything we severely under cooked .
really bad service last night ... my wife 's salad was drenched in dressing .
the drinks are cheap .
the bad .
the alcohol experience is not consistent .
this is total bs .
the girl running the karaoke runs it like a nazi on speed .
there is no bathroom in this place .
seriously wtf , chuck ?
probably wo n't be back .
bartender gave us no service .
would n't go back .
use to give a beer with your _num_ dinner not anymore .
server not honest .
just did n't care for it overall .
never hot my drinks and only seen one walk past me once .
one of the worst dining experiences i have ever had .
we waited _num_ minutes to get our food .
he 's walked by at least _num_ times and no word from any nurse .
i was extremely ill and she had no concern for that .
worst doctors office ever .
i made them refund the cost of that visit and i never went back .
there are much better physicians out there : i ca n't recommend this guy .
they overcharge or you could call it legal fraud to your insurance here .
no big deal i thought at first .
one politely declined saying that it was inappropriate .
is it wrong ?
that was n't the reason i never went back though .
so on top of being a little creepy , he dropped this bomb .
this will be my last time sitting in this office .
the front office people could care less .
they are not getting my business .
the gal at the store was not very helpful .
they 're very expensive and you can not get a refund exchange only .
and she was not willing to help me at all .
ppl at this place r neither friendly nor helpful .
that could be a problem .
order a part _num_ months ago , the guy forgot to place the order .
hmmm ... we were hoping for an a la carte menu .
we ordered mango lassi to drink and that was a highlight .
there was no spice , no heat , nothing that stood out !
i was already disappointed !
everything had potatoes in it , too much potatoes if any .
sure ... i ate ... i was hungry .
it was n't particularly good indian food .
it was just that ... food , and nothing else .
i was very disappointed because as i walked in i noticed the buffet line .
the only yummy thing was the tangy mango lassi .
if it was , it didnt taste like what ive had before .
the decor of this place was so dated .
im assuming they went buffet style b/c of the lack of business .
i 've never had such a bad experience with indian food .
spend your money elsewhere .
everything about this place was just so-so including the service .
nothing was really bad but nothing stands out .
whoever gave this place more then one star has never eaten indian food before !
besides being very bland there was a serious issue of meat !
this would n't be a problem if the prices were n't so high .
_num_ stars just for the food .
i would not go back here .
oh boy am i in trouble .
i would not go back here .
horrible food , worst customer service .
i mean guy could n't see me eating the food .
please do n't waste your money at this place .
being an indian knows how indian food taste , smell , looks like .
believe me it was nothing like that .
the menu was ok nothing fancy for the price you pay .
the service is really really really bad .
they dont care that you want something or not .
its one of the buffet you never want to waste your money .
the subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit .
when the bill came , i was in for another shock .
$ _num_ for an indian lunch buffet ?
there are just too many better places in town , i.e .
the service was probably the worst i have ever had .
buffet food was ok , but rather bland .
not a good service experience after the third time .
terrible experience from the owner .
this place is definitely not worth it 's money .
ridiculous .
utterly ridiculous .
worst customer service .
the dude does n't even know where the guest are seated .
the parking lot was surprisingly empty and i guess we now know why .
worst food we had in vegas .
also for the price its not worth .
also the parking lot was empty .
now we know why it was empty .
there 's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore .
the naan was sub-par ; more burnt air bubbles than anything .
seriously they do n't even give you real glasses or utensils to use .
but there 's more to a restaurant than the quality of the food .
finally , the plastic silverware was just too much .
$ _num_ buffet with plastic silverware !
the service was very poor , the atmosphere very average .
price was ok till u realize that all food is a la carte .
overall , i will not come here .
worst place to eat for any south indian .
very expensive buffet ( $ _num_ ) for all tasteless food .
bad ambiance and time in filling buffet items .
there are no people to take out the remaining plates .
the seating is also not so great with tables very close to each other .
i was a regular here before but deeply disappointed with my recent visit .
pathetic service , rude behavior , asking kid not to make a mess .
i suggest everyone just ignore this and try a another one .
so spicy , i could barely taste the flavor of the food .
their prices are too high for low quality food .
i hate this fucking place .
i may return , i may not .
i really did n't get that .
they quickly changed their attitude and went ahead to actually fight with us .
food looked like it was lying around for more than an hour .
thumbs down till they reach rock bottom .
there 's several things that were not right .
all the curries had no spices and the food was cold .
food was cold and service was slow .
this one only has _num_ veggie curry options , _num_ appetizer .
the experience was not great from service to food .
money wasted !
the bill was $ _num_ for _num_ tiny bowls of food and three beers .
unfortunately , this spot was very disappointing : overpriced and subpar .
i would recommend eating anywhere else in the las vegas besides this place !
trust me do not waste your time and money on this place .
i wish they had negative stars for places like this .
the food here is too spicy and the seating is limited .
i dont like spending alot of money and have to wait to be seated .
worst indian buffet i have ever had .
one word i would say is ok.
after my second visit , i realized this place is not that great .
the food does not taste fresh .
it seems like it is mainly leftovers that were frozen and then reheated .
no thanks ... not coming back !
do n't go if you 're looking for authentic indian food .
not a good choice if you 're looking for authentic indian .
this place does n't smell like money , it smells like yesterday 's ragu .
or just cheap .
so lame .
the machines also do n't spin properly .
this place is kinda gross .
avoid like the plague .
at least the tables are very cheap .
the card tables near the entrance blows the cards up sometimes .
the only plus is the cheap hot dogs and the cheap craps minimum .
it 's far off the strip and not worth the hike .
not much else of interest here to me .
ok , well i didnt go here to play slots or cheap table games .
does he believe everything he reads ?
why did i even take a bite of this mystery meat concoction ?
first off it was cold .
even that was an ordeal .
utter disappointment !
unfortunately , there was nothing of the sort on the saturday night i went .
also , there was n't a game to be had for under $ _num_ .
and the casino literally smells like vomit .
disgusting does n't even begin to describe the `` hot dog '' .
there are plenty of other bargain and cheap eats out there .
skip this one .
the smell was bad in the bathrooms and in the casino .
first , let me say that this place used to be the bomb .
since circus circus bought this place , its gone downhill .
probably still worth _num_ minutes of your time though .
nothing special at all about this place and would n't go back .
this place is no longer was it once was .
video blackjack and video roulette .
no more cheap beer or food either , just a subway and nathan 's .
no tables with real people dealing .
we went out of our way to check it out and were vary disappointed .
not worth the walk from anywhere .
there were plenty of tables , numerous bottled beers , and slots abound .
it is all video .
the place is run down and smells like crap .
the dollar hot dogs have been replaced .
there is an over priced subway inside .
there is security and maybe one server .
the place was full of people that i would cross the street to avoid .
i would n't go outta my way to visit .
saw a little snack bar with cheap eats , sodas , beers ... .
no reason to ever step foot in this place .
no drink service , no cashier , no management .
this place used to be my favorite on the strip !
no on was playing .
this year , i was going to vegas for the first time .
it is simply just a smoking room with slot machines .
who the hell goes to vegas to play pool ?
i cant imagine how they stay in business .
but for now , its just kinda sad .
you could play table games or slot machines , video poker , etc .
i do n't see how it 's still going .
mom and i used to have a blast at slots .
always would rub the winners pictures for luck - that 's all gone !
no waitresses no card games and more than half the machines are missing .
i wanted to like this place so freaking bad .
i 'm beyond disappointed .
who knew that a hot dog could take _num_ minutes to prepare .
there is also a discount ticket booth in the back .
we visited last weekend and there were _num_ or _num_ people wandering around .
am i asking too much ?
too bad ; it was a happening place before .
you want old vegas , this is old vegas .
it looks like a little greek village on the outside .
this place is downright scary .
we did n't even want to eat in this place .
it was pretty bad , though .
i 'd imagine steve wynn will expand and tear it down before long .
when i walked into the casino section , i was shocked .
there were maybe _num_ people in the casino , including me and my date .
the line for dinner was _num_ yards long .
because dinner took so long our reception went past the expected end time .
therefore , all the vendors we hired required more money to stay longer .
poor service , _num_ stars for the food still being good .
this place is n't closed at all .
avoid .
typical denny 's , decent food , slow service .
as a customer , i 'm it .
neither the paper towel nor soap dispenser worked .
my only serious problem was when i went to pay our check .
my total was $ _num_ .
i wrote in the total on the receipt , $ _num_ .
on a $ _num_ tab ?
_num_ ... _num_ ... .
_num_ ... _num_ ... .
some people cant afford a $ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ tab .
i dont want the food replaced , this has turned my stomach .
needless to say i will never come back .
had the manager comped the meal i would have skipped a negative review .
needless to say , i will never return here .
the waiter was very unhappy and seemed like he hated his job .
service was bad .
food was very bland .
p.s bathrooms had blood on the walls and no toilet paper !
i probably wo n't be back .
i do n't feel valued anymore .
terrible service !
if i could give this denny 's a negative rating i would .
then we waited _num_ minutes and never got our food !
such a frustrating experience !
your computer ca n't handle _num_ orders ?
most of the employees did n't know what they were supposed to do .
worst denny 's experience ever .
_num_ stars if possible .
this place was terrible .
they took _num_ orders and only brought _num_ .
forgot _num_ drinks .
either way the food was bad .
now i remember why i stopped liking denny 's .
service is horrible !
there are people literally asleep waiting for their order .
worst service and ice cold food .
really disappointed they kicked a players parents off the course .
not spending my $ $ here .
_num_ par _num_ 's on the course and they are all pretty tough .
it was a terrible way to start the day .
saw the marshall hitting balls in all directions from a t box .
to top it off he parked his cart on a box .
overall it sucked .
_num_ players for $ _num_ .
thin fairways .
some of the tee boxes were simply awful .
it 's sad that a course with such history is not kept better .
it 's like _num_ min .
_num_ balls ) .
finished in _num_ 1/2 hours .
this time its just horrible .
so you either hit a hole or a patch of grass or both .
the course was in very bad shape and is outdated .
it 's like playing golf through the ghetto .
i hate this place .
the other _num_ in my group had played this course before .
the staff was friendly and the beer was cold .
rude , arrogant , and mean !
it was so bad that we packed our bags and left !
_num_ $ for a men 's haircut is crazy !
do not recommend .
cheapest in town .
lots of better options at this price .
and there are parts
sorry to be so negative .
the combo of drag queens and michael jackson jokes will hardly win any awards .
i dont think i 'll even give a star .
ugh .
this place is a huge disappointment .
my room was clean , and it was actually quiet .
i needed a quick dinner so i ate in the coffee shop .
there is no comfortable place to sit and watch a sports game either .
casino games were boring and none of the arcade games worked .
i actually walked over to circus circus between meetings and had a better time .
it turned out to be a little sad .
just returned from riviera where i attended a conference .
the a/c units are too old and sound like an engine in the room .
old , old , old , and too far down the strip .
i stayed here to go on the cheap .
not next time .
this did not happen before .
if it is not law , it is crap !
they should have just added it into the price of their crappy rooms !
what a load of crap !
we ended up with a smoking room , which was n't too bad .
big mistake .
unless you 're a drag queen .
and i bet they hate this dump , too .
i 'm heading to the y the next time i need someplace to crash .
it came out to about $ _num_ a person per night , not bad .
we did n't eat there , thank god .
i feel sorry for people who did .
what a bomb .
the casino play is horrible .
then i will get a drink that taste like someone pissed in it .
i cant wait to post the review on this old pile .
dingy , strangely laid out with poor service .
do not - i repeat do not eat here .
we had lunch in the coffee shop and it was awful .
the room was spacious and had comfortable beds .
however , it was always dark and cold .
the bathroom had no ventilation and was not really clean .
disappointing to average service .
poor drink service , as seems to be standard in vegas .
not my first choice as a place to stay .
the room felt cramped .
$ _num_ for gym access ?
walgreens a block down might have been a bit cheaper , but eh .
overall not disgusting , but not a place to stay on ones ' honeymoon .
my friend booked this room trying to save money !
we stayed at the riviera after checking out of the platinum hotel on sunday .
no need to spend another _num_ dollars .
the front desk staff are rude but you get what you pay for .
it has n't been renovated in a long time , and it shows .
everything about this place is old and dusty .
he followed me downstairs and it scared me .
it smelled like death in here .
can you say false advertisement ?
we just need the room to put our bags in .
it was about _num_ dollars .
it did n't taste extraordinary either .
you could n't pay me to come back and spend another night here .
i doubt anyone comes here because they actually choose to .
stupid riviera .
casino sucks , and is depressing .
barely any tables open , even on saturday night .
pool is lame .
not cool .
restaurants are not only lame , but downright laughable .
i am not gambling person .
for the fee they charged me , the room was unacceptable .
avoid it .
it does not deserve even just one star .
damn .
but then something tells you to look down at the sheets and no .
fold it in half and sleep on top of the sheets .
our toilet was clogged with hair when we arrived .
it 's not a bad hotel , but it 's not the best either .
it 's like the motel _num_ on the strip .
the bathroom needs to be updated with new counter tops and sinks .
unless you are driving , then sure why not stay here .
walking into this place is like stepping back in time .
really , it 's just a change in furniture and new linens .
this whole end of the strip is sketchy .
it was scary ) , but i would n't wander around outside after dark .
the only good thing was that the beds were very comfortable .
check-in was terrible .
but the worst discovery was the day before we were scheduled to check out .
the charger for his new iphone had also been stolen .
do n't stay here .
if i could give zero stars i would .
my charger was also missing .
the cleaning staff denied anything and were not helpful .
either way , the hotel took no responsibility whatsoever and was anything but apologetic .
it ruined my entire experience in las vegas .
do n't stay here .
why pay for vip .
management check her , shes bad news .
hooters is nicer than this rat hole .
visiting the riviera is like watching your dog die .
it was horrible and tacky .
one problem however was coffee .
so i paid $ _num_ for a room advertised that night for $ _num_ .
some of my items were missing .
this place is not safe especially for women .
yeah , stay the hell away from this place .
unfortunately , they will be .
you 've been warned .
avoid .
first , the whole hotel smells like smoke .
you ask , well you should have called to have your room switched ?
this is just unacceptable treatment .
and the hotel did n't say sorry , did n't comp us or anything .
know what else was bad ?
this hotel is n't very good .
when i first entered i walked through the food court .
the neon lights were mostly faded showing of signs of wear and tear .
their pool room is actually not half bad .
but an hour later , where was the roll away ?
excuse me ?
his answer , `` well im not supposed to valet for you anyways '' .
parked the car , then went to the manager again .
`` im sorry thats a different department . ''
all in all , the place it self wasnt bad .
the room was pretty nice .
i mean , at least offer me show tickets , buffet tickets , anything .
pretty run down and bugs in the lobby bathrooms .
stinks when they are done .
rude staff .
got a room very cheap on priceline .
the lady taking care of us was not friendly , but also not rude .
parking was pretty awful .
the times we did use valet , they were prompt .
horrible , horrible service .
i got to the room and it was your typical standard vegas room .
and the really crappy view of something that looked like the ghetto .
i received a rude , `` we 're completely booked .
the bathroom was ok but how cheap does a hotel need to be ?
the toilet looked like it had leaked pretty badly at some point also .
the beds were super comfortable and i actually slept like a rock .
overall i was just disappointed in the options the hotel provided .
what is there to add ?
so here is my experience while staying at this dump .
we waited for about _num_ hours to check in which was crazy .
the restaurants , bars that are inside the hotel are always dead .
the food court is just nasty .
we had to rent a car because cab fare was getting expensive .
trust me you will no regret it !
what a sad disaster of a place .
the faded glory here was overwhelming .
from the servers to the clientele , this place is depressing as heck .
but if you are paying , consider other places .
the rooms were alright , but nothing special .
the casino is old and just depressing .
you 're not supposed to do that .
if i could give it less than one star i would .
i 'm still confused .
the hotel could really use some renovation .
or negative stars ?
wrong !
awkward .
way to make the customer feel incredibly uncomfortable .
our room was pretty standard .
needless to say , it was n't anything to rave about .
the only saving grace was the waffles .
literally like sewage water .
it was disgusting !
in the morning the toilet is still not working .
they ended up switching our room for another one .
the valet was _num_ stars .
she literally yelled at my husband while i was deciding what drink i wanted .
she was unprofessional , and replaced by someone even more unprofessional .
food -- -- less than one star .
_num_ stars .
avoid avoid avoid !
ick !
stayed here back in april for a friend 's birthday trip to vegas .
no thanks , not staying here ever again .
worst hotel i ever stayed .
so they r still running till the financing comes thru .
its sad to see what was a fine establishment so far gone .
i probably would n't pay to stay here again .
resort fee is $ _num_ per night .
this allows them to advertise a lower price than the actual price .
it is sneaky and sleazy .
they do n't even give you free internet access with the resort fee .
its only a preference , its not assured .
hotel was old but adequate .
these things did n't really bother me to tell you the truth .
id stay here again as long as the rooms were better cleaned .
also , lines @ check in were big at times but moved quickly .
_num_ ) huge never ending lines ( approx .
_num_ mins wait ) .
only _num_ people at the counter who were extremely slow .
_num_ ) horrible rooms .
bathrooms were run down and toilets stained .
_num_ ) location is awful .
still not bad location for the price though .
_num_ ) they forgot to reserve our rooms .
lousy service , cheap room & really lousy food .
stay here if u must but spend ur money somewhere else .
this is just a bad hotel .
i booked _num_ rooms on hotwire .
this is absurd .
the room was n't as clean as i would have expected .
overall , i think we would have been better off paying a little extra .
disappointing .
oh , and internet is $ _num_ .
tacky , tacky , tacky .
in short , we 'd stay somewhere else next time .
we did n't spend a single extra cent at the riviera .
tacky .
flat screen tv ?
old box tv .
no amenities what so ever , not even a cheap $ _num_ hair dryer .
this might also explain the awful chinese food at the buffet , angry cooks !
she did n't even offer to comp the $ _num_ room !
if it was possible to give the riviera no stars , i would .
first and foremost , the door of our suite did not lock .
huge no no .
absolute worse .
i would never stay here again .
we received no basic amenities and received all around bad service with this place .
the staff was very rude .
so glad we stayed elsewhere !
you seriously get what you pay for .
got ta say , a little disappointed .
this is the worst hotel ever .
the only reason why i stayed here was because it was free !
food in the hotel is lousy .
staff seems to have no idea what they are doing .
resort fees were ridiculous .
first off , the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary .
lame .
the only good stores are the abc stores , which have very reasonable prices .
we really should 've asked for our money back at that point .
thankfully , we had our car , so we just drove everywhere .
it 's also not near anything ... except the circus circus .
this is by far my worst experience staying in las vegas .
_num_ parking elevator is total crap .
suggest to never ever stay here even offered free !
all i have to say is _num_ hour check in .
for a hotel in vegas i was expecting a slightly more updated room .
our experience was maybe the worst i have had in any hotel .
we finally got our non smoking room , but also got very uncomfortable beds .
i could go on and on , but let 's leave it at that .
also , free wifi in the room .
my problem was regarding the door .
and it 's not just our door that 's that way .
had a very bad experience .
rooms had dated look , carpet was stained , heater was not working properly .
the amenities in the hotel are weak .
the location on the strip is n't good either .
it 's far to walk to get down to where the action is .
the staff at the riviera is very rude !
ridiculous !
also , the restaurant inside the hotel has very poor quality food .
if i could rate this hotel less than one i would .
unacceptable !
were torn down = time had passed them by in the fast lane .
he does offer to take our bags though .
are you kidding me ?
after reading some of the comments here i 'm glad we did .
all i can tell you is it 's old , worn , but clean !
not this time .
we did n't give the riviera a dime .
the sahara was nicer than this dump !
okay , so i 'm a bit spoiled .
this is by far the most awful room experience i 've ever had .
waited in line _num_ hours to check in .
very disappointed .
but apparently riviera staff had something different in mind .
first i had to pay $ _num_ in resort fees .
ugh .
ugh .
worst experience ever at a hotel .
plus , the dealer named wolfgang was very rude to us as well .
horrible experience .
when we checked in , my reservations were still not in their system .
most horrible hotel experience ever .
horrible .
i did this , and was given the run around ( literally ) .
biggest problem was valet services .
took nearly _num_ minutes to get a taxi every time .
check-in was also a lengthy process .
i do n't know where to start other than this place is awful .
i had my room broken into and all of my electronics were stolen .
their service was horrible and hotel manager was incredibly rude .
instead , i get sad when i come here .
a major facelift is in order .
the non smoking room smells of stale cigarettes .
the maids are noisy starting early in the morning .
not a place i would recommend .
according to my experience , it is not .
the whole place looks old , noisy and crappy .
the room we got smelled so bad .
apparently the house keeper never even tried to clean it .
the first day , they brought me one english muffin when i ordered two .
we waited _num_ minutes in front of our door and no one came .
i asked for potential hallway cameras and i was told that there were none .
we immediately left and found another hotel to finish out our vegas stay .
it is not safe and honestly the staff really did n't care .
this hotel does not deserve even one star .
it is a total dump .
bad service , crappy room , everything is outdated .
i would not stay here again , though .
i 'm staying here now and am disappointed that we decided to do so .
of course , now we are unhappy .
no call back .
but customer service is weak .
that 's not to say that it 's bad .
and then i discovered that they had lost my reservation .
if nothing else , it 's cheap .
it kinda made me feel like frank .
not bellagio , yet .
i should n't get ahead of myself .
i could use the fish and chips as an excuse .
pool sucks , slots were so tight i wont go into details !
this place is horrible and i will never stay here again .
we got _num_ full size mattress in a cockroach room .
not enough !
do not stay here .
, cockroach filled and their customer service is a joke .
my friends and i will never stay here again .
the room was tolerable , though disappointing for the $ .
probably not .
i called security , they never showed .
nasty !
the front desk people are rude and do n't even let you speak .
the whole place is old and needs some serious renovations .
rooms sucked bad .
one of the worst hotel experiences ever !
ill pitch in to blow it up !
none of them were cleaned .
every worker there was unhappy and looked like they were out of it .
service was very slow no matter where you went .
and parking sucked .
i probably would have had a better experience .
so if you do stay , carefully check your bill at check out .
they will try and steal every dime from you they can .
ok , so the room in general is not that bad for the money .
but , the negatives are plenty .
first of all , the check in was ridiculous .
the bartender was really rude when i showed him my drink coupon .
also , the drinks were horrible .
now the worst part : the elevator to the parking structure .
omg , i got stuck in it and had to press the emergency button .
never happened to me before .
she did n't act to surprised she acted like it was a normal thing .
before pearl left i asked her when will housekeeping come clean my room .
i am very surprised that this hotel was not appeared on hotels impossible .
i would n't recommend this hotel to anyone .
stay clear from this hell hole .
i will never ever be back to the riviera hotel and casino .
wo n't be staying here again .
this place is really old school but i like that old school look .
i was pretty unhappy with this place .
i had reservations for nearly _num_ months for a convention i attended .
about _num_ weeks before the conference , i called to confirm my reservation .
find elsewhere to take your business .
it 's dirty , dingy , dark , and depressing .
, but it had since expired .
i was disappointed that the bingo room closed as well .
the two big negatives was the buffett and parking .
both were sketchy as hell .
i 'm hesitant to stay here again even if the room is comped .
worst hotel experience ever !
just got back from _num_ days at the riviera and it was horrible .
i 'm almost too ashamed to write this review .
my friends booked a hotel room here cuz they got a groupon deal .
little did i know they got a room here .
to be honest , the room is n't too bad .
the most annoying thing about this place was the location of the hotel .
but the sad part was that it was kinda slow .
after doing my research i found that this hotel only had _num_ 1/2 stars .
the staff was very rude and unfriendly .
the walls are paper thin , the carpet is absolutely gross .
the bathrooms had no vent at all , it was nasty as everything else .
i can not think of one positive thing to say about this place .
refused to honor my groupon even though i had already booked online !
there was nothing special about the room .
the interior of hotel , hallways , casinos , and room felt old .
also , the room was really cramped and small .
also , some of the cleaning staff were very rude and just looked miserable .
riviera is the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in my life .
first i could n't believe it , the reality was too hard to believe .
i 've got no words to express my disappointment .
if i could give it a zero , i would .
the service was horrible .
they proceeded to tell me it would cost triple per night to upgrade .
some mold and dust .
we stayed here last summer after booking through hotwire for $ _num_ a night .
the hotel itself is old and it smells weird in the lobby .
the beds were very comfy and and the linens were clean .
it 's a really tired casino .
now , i would n't recommend anyone to stay here .
this was my first and last time staying here .
the bathroom was horrible , the rim around the shower was half way off .
not to mention the ice machine was on the other floor .
would n't recommend it .
worst hotel ever .
so dumb .
disgusting .
they would not honor the same rate for multiple rooms .
the place is kinda creepy .
not only was the food mediocre , at best , the service was horrendous .
the food is horrible and the way they treated me is outrageous .
do n't waste your money .
the lobby was dirty and old .
the room was old , smelly , and noisy as all hell .
the bed was as hard as a rock .
huge mistake .
the pool was n't even open when we were there .
_num_ days _num_ nights for $ _num_ .
i was n't expecting _num_ star for that price and this hotel .
the room i stayed in was actually better then i expected .
i highly do not recommend going to the food court at all .
overall for the price ca n't complain too much .
this place has gone downhill and it makes me sad !
it looks like a yard sale walking through the casino .
there was paper thrown about , and drink cups everywhere .
we noticed a cheese steak place , mediterranean , , subway , etc .
the pizza was pure grease .
there was barely any sauce on it .
i thought it was a waste of money personally .
got my money and she was _num_ for _num_ .
i 'm sorry sir she 's not available .
it 's awful !
i think this may have been my worst hotel experience ever .
the customer service is terrible and beware the staff will lie to you !
she too had been lied to by the reservations people .
i think this may have been my worst hotel experience ever .
the customer service is terrible and beware the staff will lie to you !
she too had been lied to by the reservations people .
no thanks .
there were so many problems with our stay .
- our room was not cleaned in the _num_ hours we stayed there .
it was either make it or loose the $ _num_ spent on tickets .
it was told to the staff that we were visiting for our honeymoon .
the ceilings are low .
i 'm never staying here again !
we get there and find out that the seats in the back were horrible !
you could not see the stage at all !
i wo n't ever visit this casino again .
the last time i stayed here was last year .
the rooms were n't so bad , i find it to be rather small .
however , the arcade is pretty small .
the hallways to the rooms were narrow and low .
the ice machines are not every floor .
do n't go for this place .
should me id , he said open the door , i said nope !
should me id , he said open the door , i said nope !
after about _num_ minutes he was gone .
room is nice , lock the door , dont talk to anyone in vegas !
i felt no cleaning materials were being used .
the casino was basically empty , as was the food court .
there were empty rooms and doors not working in prime real estate space .
this hotel is really disgusting .
someone else reserved the room or else i would have stayed somewhere else .
the chairs and carpets were stained and nasty .
it looked like someone died in there .
really creepy .
the door looked like it had been busted in at one point .
we requested a different room , but they did not give it to us .
i had been looking forward to going swimming , but the pool was closed .
because the windows were so thin , it made it impossible to sleep .
having a confirmed reservation for a non-smoking room means just that .
at least one bath towel had a hole in it .
on the other hand , this led to many empty table games .
video poker pay lines were the worst of any i have seen .
the comps are virtually nonexistent aside from the standard cocktail offers .
we stayed at the riviera because it was a groupon deal .
bad call .
the restaurants are just ok .
check-in : very long line and only _num_ clerks .
fake .
that bathtub did not drain .
but it is not at all nice .
very , very dated .
the conference area was n't good .
there was no internet connection as promised in many areas .
the hallways were hard to walk down .
technology help was sparse and slow .
it 's far from the strip and a bit gross and very dated .
i 'm amazed i did n't get ill .
just sad .
the wynn is probably the closest place at a _num_ minute walk .
when i checked in the woman was rude .
the window was broken and bed was hard as a rock .
all of the restaurants closed at _num_ except one which was overpriced .
they 're even books in the room were also outdated .
spend the extra money and go somewhere else .
we ignored yelp reviews warning customers of bed bugs ( read them .
bad decision .
what a poor , poor example of customer service .
now that 's poor customer service .
this is a serious problem that the hotel apparently has not addressed properly .
at the end i paid _num_ $ extra for _num_ nights .
worst check in ever !
been in line for _num_ minutes , worse than the dmv .
i immediately cancelled the reservation .
shame on you riviera !
when we got back that night the toilet was fixed .
still has popcorn on the ceiling , clean but not anything fancy .
would never , never stay here again ... never !
just stayed a week at the `` riviera '' .
i had booked a non-smoking room through expedia .
at the end of seven days , the extra charges were $ _num_ .
just so you know , non-smoking is an upgrade you will pay for .
never going back .
our room ( that we reserved ) was given away .
then we got stuck in a garage elevator .
to top it off , the hotel layout was confusing .
nothing went right .
the staff was rude , our room was disgusting .
_num_ star .
we booked our hotel room and got our reservation at the riviera .
what a mistake .
what the hell !
this hotel really needs to step up its game !
what the actual hell ?
is this _num_ ?
what department does n't have a phone !
would not stay again .
horrible .
worst customer service ever .
casino has literally _num_ machines .
no live dealers .
i arrived at riviera around 11pm to check in .
whatever , i just wanted to get into my room .
it was worst than the local la quinta .
i am an easy going girl , really , but this was outrageous .
-- are you kidding me ?
that 's probably why you would never want to stay here .
do not waste your time like we did !
a security guard came up to my room and i filed an incident report .
she assured me that risk management would call me .
she took the lamp and told me maintenance would replace the lamp .
i tried calling risk management every day .
on _num_ july _num_ housekeeping came to the room around _num_ am .
i went down to the front desk and they gave me _num_ more keys .
i went back to my room and those keys did n't work .
i explained what happened and how i already got _num_ new keys .
he said he 'd help and he followed me to my room .
he told me firearms are n't allowed in the building .
`` why are you mad ? ''
all the money i had in the safe was taken .
they did n't refund me for my extra night stay .
i filed a police report with las vegas metro police .
my biggest issue was the lack of up keep .
our hotel room was clean and basic , the bed was comfy .
the problem is that it is run poorly .
they had about _num_ staff checking everyone in .
thats how bad this hotel is .
hot room , but at least i had a nice view of the pool .
the casino itself sucks .
check-in was horrible .
avoid this place , unless u seriously cant afford another spot .
you get what you pay for and the riviera is no exception .
the casino is definitely dated but does n't feel as dingy as it could .
our upgraded room was seedy .
stains on the bathroom sink and counter but not dirt .
the bed covers looked too old .
the price was better than many and we stayed there based on expedia reviews .
we had already booked for the return trip so stayed there again .
the room was much nicer .
however , we will book elsewhere next time .
customer service is really lacking .
no microwave for use in the whole hotel .
r buffet has no takeout option .
the room stinks , no microwave , no coffee maker .
i wish it was possible to give a _num_ rate instead _num_ .
check in was slow because there was only _num_ person working .
the hallway was really dark and creepy .
the worst customer service ever by the front desk manager and reservation agent .
needless to say it was not a great experience .
this hotel was awful .
cheap but so are better hotels in vegas .
i asked her opinion , the clerk said pool view would be much better .
i gave the hotel _num_ stars because the room was clean .
bed is bad , showers are worst , its worse than a motel _num_ .
the casino is too small .
you do n't feel vegas .
rooms have a bad smell .
parking is too far .
nothing to see .
worst hotel ever !
i made a reservation requesting a non smoking room .
i was waiting for _num_ min and one never showed up .
horrible service !
wtf no keep my money ill go somewhere else .
i just drove from one state to the other after work .
i go to vegas twice a month and i 'll never stay here .
i mean , just walking this place and you can feel something is missing .
it 's really not fair .
however , time has clearly passed this place over .
the carpets are stained and dirty , the casino feels outdated .
even the shows do n't seem to call to me .
upon check-in , the clerk gave us the wrong room number .
no thanks .
$ _num_ beer .
the banana leaf cafe was horrible as well .
the r steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well .
not quite cool .
just old folks gambling .
it now sits empty and abandoned .
the few people i ever saw in there looked embarrassed , avoiding eye contact .
i 'm sure i 'm better off .
smoke is smoke .
then on my last day there , the elevators went down .
dirty rooms , and was overcharged on the room .
you know , i do n't give a lot of single star ratings .
this hotel is the worst i have ran into .
i mean , their main attraction is an act i remember from the 80s .
it was limited , and was n't a huge fan .
the only redeeming quality surprisingly enough , was the buffet on site .
dirty , elevator seems like its going to break .
crappy service .
but heck u get what u pay for !
the sink did n't drain and neither did the bath tub .
called house keeping for more towels and soap , never received them .
zero stars !
this place is awful and the customer service is twenty times worse !
so beware of discount deals from this place .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
i mean , come on !
needless to say , we will never go back to the riviera again .
not terrible for the price .
this is the situation i was least happy with .
worse customer service period !
from front desk to manager they are all rude .
we got the luxury room booked with _num_ double bed .
when we got in the room , the bath tub has _num_ long hair !
do not believe the hotel amenities : saying they have sauna , steam room .
no , they do not have those .
do not see shows here !
then , given a room , opened the door only to find it occupied .
the casino was clean , but a dated and the drink staff were great .
the room ended up being decent after an hour of air conditioner .
across the street from the nasty filthy circus circus .
nothing around it .
small casino that you get bored with quickly .
no valet .
i get that this place is historic , but that 's no excuse .
just do n't stay here .
you 're in vegas ... you deserve better baby .
slept well ( alcohol helped ) loud ac .
the check-in time is ridiculous !
they have absolutely no waiting times .
this is simply unacceptable .
i am only staying here because of a stupid convention i 'm attending here .
my allergies were acting up everytime we were in our room .
all _num_ pillows were so old and stained with yellow .
management really doesnt seem to care here !
_num_ ) check-in took us _num_ hr .
annoying , but not a deal breaker .
gross , who knows what soaked the carpet .
all our bags got wet along with our socks .
there was a safety pin sticking out from underneath the sheets .
ca n't get worse , right ?
gag .
other than that , it 's not much to speak of .
they have no poker room , which was a big disappointment .
i have to agree with all the other bad reviews .
but did n't see any .
_num_ . )
empty pool was a bit weird to me .
regardless of it being winter you do have resort fees !
they do n't want you to stay there .
no apology or attempt to fix the broken internet .
and , no , they don ; t call you .
its not really a safe place to walk on your own after _num_ .
just in case you do n't notice .
it was closed , but its small and very unappealing .
would hate to explain it to the kid in the elevator .
there are plenty of better choices .
if i could give them _num_ stars , i would .
never staying in this lame hotel ever again .
we had a _num_ night stay here that was part of a promotion .
the biggest complaints were no coffee in the room .
i had one breakfast here that was just fair .
service was slow .
this place sucks .
if you want $ _num_ tables and no wifi , come here .
otherwise , it 's crap .
white trash everything .
if you respect yourself , do n't come here .
do n't be cheap , get a good hotel .
the casino is not fun .
i spent all my time at other locations .
there is no reason to stay here .
i have never had such a horrible experience .
i will never stay in this hell hole ever again !
highly disappointed .
i could understand if we were rude first but we were n't .
from the front desk to the manager they all had a horrible attitude .
riviera is old tacky and lousy .
we stayed in the non smoking suite .
not recommended .
regret the buy and wo n't make the mistake again .
many of the dealers are just nasty !
well _num_ and half hours have passed and the mess is still there .
this place is a mess !
if i could rate a negative star i would .
experience here this past weekend was just horrible .
$ _num_ resort fee per night .
called the front desk and _num_ hour later , no progress .
_num_ minutes later , nothing .
this has been the most disgusting experience in my life !
then i find out _num_ other people had same problem !
horrible experience do n't stay at this hotel !
the minute you walk up to this hotel , you can smell sewage .
once you walk in , it 's like instantly stepping back into _num_ 's .
it is very old , smelly , outdated and run down .
check in was long even _num_ at night .
the room itself was clean , but very small .
i would hate to see what the cheaper rooms looked like .
next time in vegas i will be getting a room elsewhere .
big mistake .
too bad .
no apologies and no offers to move us .
this made no sense to me at all .
all of us agreed our nye was ruined .
probably one of the worst run and seedy casino hotels .
the only ok thing is the gym .
this fitness center has old equipment , but many to use .
the hash brown was greasy and could n't be eaten .
i only spent two days here for a convention .
it looks like it just got a remodel .
not enough close parking and valet was full .
driving around to find more parking is a nightmare .
a little scary too .
everything outside the rooms is outdated .
that 's is in top of the $ _num_ charge .
the staff needs training in hospitality .
our room was outdated at least _num_ years .
all the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained .
our tv did not work , nor did our phone .
could not call for room service .
had to call out to some nasty italian food place .
could n't even sign in to their promised wifi .
no one seemed to care !
oh yea , plus a resort fee of $ _num_ per day !
this hotel is what me and my boyfriend called `` functional '' .
the water pressure in the shower was very high ; it almost hurt .
the iron did not function properly .
which she suddenly added $ _num_ onto after we agreed upon the price .
also , i failed to mention the horrible restaurant service .
this place was not all that great .
answering questions is a hassle for them .
the bed i have to say is hands down beyond comfortable so kudos there .
food was awful and over priced .
dont know if there is anything else good besides the bed .
plain gross .
_num_ stars .
get the old vegas feel , but find a bed somewhere else .
yes , it is cheap , for a reason .
we had an ok view of the strip , whatever .
friday night , however , was when the issue started .
they agreed to wave the upgrade and resort fees , saving us $ _num_ .
a very dated , old hotel with only one pool that is crowded .
terrible coffee shops with terrible quality food court .
i do n't even know where to start .
this hotel is horrible u get what you pay for .
this hotel is old , the restrooms ohhhh lord they are very small .
this hotel is sad .
if ur on a budget this hotel is cheap but expect the worst .
i wish i could give a negative star .
it was horrible , even for people who is used the smoke .
we pressed every button there was and it did nothing .
our room still had n't been cleaned !
with all the hotels in vegas , i would definitely stay somewhere else .
bathroom floor looked dirty .
the bathrooms featured the cheapest toilet paper and soap i have ever seen .
felt like i was washing with lava soap .
this was just after _num_ am .
i will never stay here again and wo n't be recommending it to anyone .
i realize i was not paying for luxury .
this has been the worst experience from a vegas hotel ever .
i put down $ _num_ deposit on my credit card .
so , we get to the room and couch does n't pull out .
this is not ruth chris by any means .
this place is terrible fist _num_ minutes to check in after arriving at 11pm .
based off my luck here not even hitting casino .
next year for the tournament we will be staying elsewhere .
the convenience is n't worth how grossed out i was by this hotel .
be charged and not another surprise .
to $ _num_ per night .
i was pretty disappointed and would suggest staying somewhere else .
carpeting is stained and dirty .
towels are old , stained , & dirty .
beds are old , dirty , and stained .
walls are old , dirty , and stained .
right when i entered the hotel it was empty .
i never seen an empty hotel in vegas before .
service was sooo slow .
we came back by 4pm , and nothing was done .
there was actually a very long line of very angry customers at this point .
what a nightmare .
the following night , my husband and i got back to the room late .
then it was time to check out of the rooms .
ridiculous !
dont think ill be returning here unless desperate for a room .
line was long , kiosk messed our room keys up .
that was a lie , it was actually _num_ a room extra .
the room was okay , just literally okay .
overall it was pretty disappointing for my first vegas trip .
do n't recommend .
worst hotel experience i have ever had .
manager did n't seem to care .
just stay away from this run down property .
the worst hotel i have every stayed at on the strip .
the room was old but alright for the short amount of time i stayed .
the part that was the worst was the staff !
when we got to it was broken so we lost our spot in line .
hotel and i will never stay here again .
however , i was n't exactly satisfied with my experience here .
- _num_ of the _num_ lights in my room worked .
the staff made no attempt to fix this during my stay .
- the food court was nothing to brag about .
the riviera came up and the price was very cheap .
bad idea .
i was not very happy with the room .
i was really surprised they closed the pool so early .
but as i said , you get what you pay for .
if there was any remodeling being done it was over _num_ years ago .
omg and the bathrooms were awful .
so we stood there for another _num_ minutes .
my girlfriend and i stayed here last week .
compared to the normal hotel in vegas ... this place is a dump .
at $ _num_ dollars a night i expect my towels to be clean .
the sheets are already stained and the pillows are thin .
i paid $ _num_ in addition to a $ _num_ resort fee .
the bars suck badly .
circus circus across the street has better slots .
horrible booking experience .
staff is useless .
pay a little extra somewhere else not worth the headache .
it was beyond creepy .
i ca n't describe how filthy and out dated everything is .
the $ _num_ resort fee ?
that place is a poor excuse of a resort .
our tv was an old school tv .
when we walked through the halls , it smelled so much like smoke .
they would spray down my room .
before i was able to talk , she walked away .
excuse me , i wanted to talk to management , not her .
worst vegas experience i have ever had !
the entire casino went down and would not let me cash out .
the room we were assigned was so filthy .
the room smelled like old carpet .
not even if the room was free .
my health is worth more than a cheap room .
service horrible !
i could piss harder than the water pressure in the bathroom .
could n't get a parking spot even in valet .
this place is a piece is a total piece of crap !
when you read the negative reviews here and elsewhere , believe them .
if i could give them less than a star i would .
it was really bad .
as if a description of my wife a phone was n't enough !
am i being too picky ?
it was the worst piece of meat i have ever had .
it was really chewy , really tough , not enjoyable at all .
my check for just the meal and soft drink was about $ _num_ .
i would n't even give this place a star .
i would n't even walk back in to this place if you paid me .
no seriously ?
no wifi access at all .
you can even get a connection from circus circus from your room .
ive been here for a week , customer service is really bad .
drinks are very cheap but also comes with a bad attitude .
stayed here again on a quieter weekend .
that 's something the riviera needs to work on and stop ignoring .
no sorry , no concern , just ... an upsell .
the man who picked up flat out denied our request for an upgrade .
what hotel would refuse a customer paying for an upgrade ?
things did n't add up .
never again for us or anyone we know .
this hotel in vegas needs to be upgraded .
this place is horrible !
the employees clearly have no manners or sense of customer service !
parking in the garage was usually difficult .
i would n't recommend this place unless you 're really on a budget .
major dump , stay away .
rooms are shit - old and outdated even tho advertised as `` remodeled '' .
also was required to file incident with security .
this is _num_ weeks after vegas .
this hotel is old , smelly and just overall filthy .
so , no i will never stay here again .
continued to watch my movie in the am and was charged double .
$ _num_ times two for the same movie ?
i even talked to a supervisor .
worst front desk service ever !
never seen anything like it .
we went to the room assigned and the room was not made .
the bed was still used and dirty towels were on the floor .
this hotel is dirty and the service is horrendous .
room was fine especially for the price but - i would never stay again .
( i think i should report them to the bbb .
also , no business center , no gym , no coffee , no nothing .
the room itself was dated , but reasonably clean .
the view from the window was of the first floor roof and nothing else .
no internet !
i will never stay here again !
i 'm not sure where i should begin .
first off i was there for our ball .
worst mistake !
still not a bad price for vegas .
the hallway had a completely different smell then the casino .
the bed was comfy so i ca n't really complain .
there were so many hidden fees that they do n't tell you about .
the pool was closed so there should n't even be a resort fee .
very disappointing .
i was n't expecting much to begin with .
ac did n't cool at all .
this hotel might have been cool some _num_ years ago .
avoid staying here at any cost .
my room was very spacious and bed was comfortable .
looks like a place that time forgot .
our stay was an absolute disaster !
we had a lamp that was removed as a safety hazard and never replaced .
so , clearly it was not our computers , but your network !
no coffee maker in the room ?
i have never stayed anywhere that did n't offer coffee !
that is simply unacceptable !
there is no excuse for the way we were treated this weekend !
the wi-fi in here is weak and slow .
whatever you do do not stay here .
the deposit was n't an issue .
this was the worse las vegas hotel stay ever .
our room was horrible .
i do not recommend at all .
i really try to avoid negative reviews unless absolutely necessary .
beds were uncomfortable and the shower was lousy .
no pretty lights , no sir .
everyone in the hotel looked like they wanted to kill us .
and the icing on the cake , taxi drives avoided us like the plague .
at least they wo n't make you feel like a complete asshole .
it is one of the worst places to stay in vegas .
they promised us extra bed and they failed to provide one .
the toilet had water issue .
it is serious time for it to get remodeled .
do n't stay at this hotel .
the receptionist did n't even bother to apologize at all .
worst customer service ever .
this hotel doesnt have enough parking space for its guests .
worst place ever in vegas .
horrible customer service on top of filthy environment !
the hotel was bad .
i 've stayed in cheaper hotels that offer better beds and toiletries .
the tv did n't work .
the after at _num_ in the morning the noise in the ceiling was horrible .
worst hotel ever .
red was cold and blue was hot .
what a crappy hotel !
if you have another option take it , do not stay here .
they gave us _num_ king bed instead of _num_ queens that we had requested .
do not spend any money on this hotel .
this hotel is as bad as people say .
it smelled like pure sewage outside walking to the hotel .
did n't do it .
the hallways are dark , dingy and just weird .
this place is absolutely horrible .
hot water only part of my first shower .
none at all today .
this morning , my third morning , i was doing yoga on the floor .
so gross .
i 've been to vegas several time and stayed in many of the hotels .
the riviera is one of the worst .
the room is old , needs a makeover badly .
you ca n't adjust the shower head or the flow of water .
so disappointed .
one of the worst vegas hotels i have been to .
needs to be badly remodeled .
very uncomfortable beds .
will never return here !
worst experience ever .
alma , front desk manager , screwed up our reservations for our trade show .
on our way to vegas from la we called to verify our reservations .
i 'm allergic to smoke .
this place was pretty bad .
lines were to long for meals .
food court ... philly cheesesteaks were delicious !
chinese food place was the worst !
chow mein was the worst ever !
salt n pepper chicken was worst than the noodles !
o yea , teriyaki chicken taste like flour and soy sauce !
the games are terrible and the pit is sweaty and rude .
do n't dare try to win playing _num_ .
this place is the biggest dump in vegas , and that 's pretty bad .
i was not prepared for this .
worst hotel ever !
it dos n't even deserve one star .
took me two hours to get checked in .
treated me like crap and just was talking rude to me .
would give it _num_ stars if i could .
this place has bed bugs .
i was in room _num_ and there were bed bugs .
the walls of the second restroom in our suit were filthy and stained .
very disappointment that we celebrated our anniversary in this hotel .
very bad check in experience .
the decor is very dated and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired .
our room was relatively clean if you disregard the weird stains on the curtains .
unfortunately , the experience was very different .
my first example of this is no more real perks .
the offer no specials for occasions .
which was disappointing since we went over my birthday .
for positives , i truly do n't have much .
it wo n't be around much longer , and clearly it shows .
learn from my mistakes do not stay here .
i ca n't give zero stars .
i came here march _num_ at 12:30 a.m. and the staff are so rude .
but wow was it bad !
the only thing that was god was the parking .
both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf .
very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out .
never again !
the service was ok but i would never stay here again .
the room was clean and the staff was friendly .
however do not use your debit or credit card to pay for anything .
this answer should always be no .
it 's always worse than you think though .
the cable and tv did n't work from the beginning .
the room smelled like smoke and cigarettes the entire time .
it does n't work .
they charge a resort fee will providing none of the resort amenities .
the beds are uncomfortable everything looks run down .
it 's cheap .
it wo n't shock you by being better than expected .
do it if you really just need a bed in vegas .
i only came to visit ... but would definitely never stay there .
the wifi is seriously horrible every where in this hotel !
total fake .
ones we got there the rooms were nothing like the pictures .
they were horrible .
i recommend never stay here worst place ever .
what a nasty little hotel .
ugh ... so sad we checked out and came to this dump .
by the way , the pictures of classic room online was such a lie .
the room i am sitting in right at this moment is a nightmare .
i want my money back riviera .
worst hotel i 've stayed at on the strip hands down .
or not !
outdated !
the restroom , mostly the shower , smells like a combination urine and mold .
our clothing iron in our room did n't work .
but i think they left out , `` classic stains !
i had horrible customer service at riviera .
the room was old and musty .
the room i was in definitely had not been renovated in decades .
they advertise as pet friendly , but were anything but .
i would not recommend the riviera to anyone .
the check in line was long we waited about _num_ minutes .
it looked like they have n't done anything to the casino since the 70s .
it was hot on the casino floor .
there is no credit balance on the card .
i was totally unimpressed with the casino host .
so i went back the next week to look for these rules .
an employee hosting the tournament told me they could grab me a copy .
i did n't remember seeing anything about rules .
the place can go to hell now for all i care .
nice but straight up _num_ .
personally , i 'm surprised that it even lasted this long .
another famous las vegas hotel & casino now a thing of the past .
we were moved up a floor to the side overlooking the disgusting lower roof .
old , dingy , over used , and barely holding themselves together .
after two days , _num_ shirts to be dry cleaned not ready .
i got the same back but one shirt was not mine .
i returned it hoping to get my thomas pink shirt back .
no luck .
this business lost my clothing .
same for the better business bureau .
in addition , most of clothes are returned poorly cleaned .
so i refused to leave .
i do not recommend this business .
dropped my suit off on a wednesday for my cousins wedding on saturday .
waited for _num_ min with no one else there waiting and upon receiving it .
went here to get my check engine light off .
never going back .
had the problem before and it was fixed quickly and affordable ... not here .
i was told the car would be done by _num_ that day .
i had to wait _num_ more hours while they worked on it some more .
would n't recommend it and will not go back .
not a good sign , it took the entire day .
i could n't believe it .
they could n't believe it .
no one else worked on my breaks since my visit @ don di 's .
this place has some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
_num_ days and $ _num_ i finally have my car back .
at that point our car should have been ready in a couple of days .
apparently `` help '' means $ _num_ off .
i really struggled with whether or not i wanted to post this .
$ _num_ work requested machine work - what is that ?
i brought it back and was told the battery was dead .
_num_ stars for us .
meanwhile it took us almost _num_ weeks to get our only vehicle back .
no one cared or took responsibility for what had happened .
shame on you !
just be prepared for what you pay for ... cheap work .
the absolute worst place i have ever taken my truck to be worked on .
never give this company a down payment .
they will not do the work and they will keep your money .
$ _num_ for the transmission and $ _num_ for the brakes .
i was told i would have to put $ _num_ down .
i understand that i will have to eat the $ _num_ for brakes .
that leaves a balance of $ _num_ owed me .
they will not return my money .
my contact at desert auto , paul will not help me .
he will not give me a number to call .
another nightmare .
dishonest and worst repair !
replace an upper oil pan , costs me _num_ $ !
the oil pan costs only _num_ $ .
i have to echo laura m. 's post below .
i could have used my car those _num_ days .
`` no , we do n't do that kind of work here . ''
paul then tells me that they sealed the tire !
went here looking for camping gear .
service is a little slow .
there was also only one register open and a long line of people .
hate this store !
very limited product but what makes it worse is the cashiers !
bottom line ... this place sucks !
just dreadful .
a lot of the food here is sold by the pound or half pound .
you ca n't make this stuff up .
no , that is not me . )
it 's actually $ _num_ if you do n't finish .
i value my car 's interior too much .
before we left _num_ people had tried and failed the challenge .
the chicken fingers were clearly overcooked .
no seasoning and the fries were cheap frozen fries with no salt or seasoning .
the fries cheap frozen curly fries with no salt .
neither of us ate 1/2 our meals and the service was sketchy at best .
thats really sad .
the service was horrible .
that was ok , as its not their fault that their were packed .
but then , we sat there with no menus for _num_ minutes .
servers were just walking around and werent really making themselves useful .
however , we got none of the above .
so , i ordered the small version of it .
no flavor at all except processed cheese ... ugh !
the fries were burned and the dogs were too .
it was just a crappy experience over all .
if i could give negative stars i would .
no grilled cheese , veggie burgers or anything of the sort .
her boss on duty has no customer service skills ... avoid this place ... .
the worst .
it 's _num_ lbs .
the food was expensive and not even good .
karma sucks huh ?
they are definitely not vegetarian friendly .
my friend could n't order anything .
you get _num_ minutes to try .
one of the worst burritos i 've ever had !
it took forever to get our food .
terrible service and disappointing food sum up my experience at nascar caf .
it was gross .
the burger was also disappointing .
this is the only reason i went there a little while back .
the place is horrible .
no good food to speak of .
fast food burritos and chili taste better .
burger sucked .
overcooked , no seasoning , i could n't finish the thing .
service was courteous and not too slow - we sat at the bar .
breakfast service was bad , french toast is n't great .
very awkward .
so no one ended up doing the burrito challenge .
but i was so hungry i ate them all .
prices seemed overly high considering the wait time and the quality .
thats why we chose the cafe cuz we were tired and hungry .
would definitely advise not to eat here or use the arcade services .
unfortunately we did order the _num_ oz .
this took approximately _num_ minutes to arrive at our table .
no complaints here .
not noticeably bad but nothing to write home about either .
clam chowder was thick and tasty with almost no actual clams present .
_num_ lb .
the food and service does n't warm anything .
this place does not deserve a star !
they said , `` nothing .
too busy ?
what a waste !
wrong !
anyway , this place sucks , way too expensive too .
so my husband orders a beer , they do n't have it .
_num_ out of _num_ were out .
my husband ordered a chicken sandwich which came with curly fries .
skip this place not worth the time or money .
poor , poor nascar cafe .
worst of all , most of the cafe is shut down !
not that i really like nascar , i 'm just saying .
when we complained the waitress brushed us off completely .
he was horribly rude to me and my mom .
not worth buying from there .
i would give more , but management is the worst .
i went here and boy was i disappointed .
firstly , the place was a run down office .
secondly , the staff was rude .
extremely disappointed and i wo n't be going back !
i wish i had seen the review by christopher before coming to this establishment .
if i could give less than one star , i would .
he said `` the front desk does n't always have the right answer '' .
they refunded my payment , but wasted most of my day .
i also think it 's bad form to blame your staff .
either way , i 'd avoid this place !
maybe in some cases , his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works .
a nightmare !
he is extremely rude and condescending .
i shall end this now , please go elsewhere , anywhere , your welcome .
weak .
i did not take the risk .
this office has the worst patient provider communication i have ever seen .
my father who can barely walk needed a handicapped hang tag .
the home would not let her in with out it being signed .
_num_ days late , which made it almost _num_ weeks !
the doctor probably had no idea this was going on !
the doctor rescheduled my appointment because her staff took forever to verify my insurance !
such as waste of time .
on top of that the office staff is always rude to patients .
i am very disappointed in this doctor !
i had no clue !
always rushed !
my body was acting like it was having an allergic reaction .
he was rude to me and did n't listen to my concerns .
plus , i would spend hours waiting to be seen , which is ridiculous .
the incompetence i witnessed at this office was unparalleled .
_num_ % of the time i 'm waiting 30-45 minutes to see the doctor .
the ladies up front have no clue what they 're doing .
i 'm being asked to remove my reviews from yelp .
stop what we are doing and wait for them to be done .
not to mention all the random people drive my dogs crazy !
hate to know what would happen if we worked outside our home somewhere .
i wo n't remove my review .
very unhappy .
we 're broke after the crap we 've been through here !
it was so frustrating that this had happened .
overall , this location was a disappointment .
worst vs i have ever been to .
only one person was friendly and welcoming .
i did not purchase anything .
do not come here the service is horrible .
the fitting room girl was rude too .
with a huge attitude and negative tone .
nothing like my local sephora .
anyone who knows me knows that i am a makeup / product junkie !
i can spend hours in sephora just playing with make up .
as a matter of fact there were at least _num_ of them .
dear sephora vegas - work on customer service .
they have every product you could ever imagine but the customer service is terrible .
and just pointed to where i could find something rather than showing me .
the worst part it was n't even busy !
rude staff , no greeting or welcoming !
not helpful at all .
i walk away and i saw her was chatting with bunch of coworkers .
no one was paying attention but chatting to other coworkers .
i was looking for something specific and i did n't find any stacked .
this was the third sephora i 've been to all day .
i felt so uncomfortable .
was very disappointed at the service .
and she was also not explaining products correctly .
not top notch service like i would expect from a sephora .
she was shockingly rude .
i know i that i will not be shopping here anymore .
maybe try one of the other _num_ or _num_ locations on the strip ?
they are standing around talking in groups instead of greeting customers .
they constantly mess up phone orders .
time to switch to ulta ladies there employees take care of you .
i 've never been so disappointed .
not worth $ _num_ a night .
there was n't even a table like in the room two doors down .
this hotel is horrible !
room was dirty , stains on the carpet .
$ _num_ iron from walmart and you choose to steal there used one .
no staff able to bring you anything .
no fan in bathroom , shower door wouldnt close .
my list goes on .
i clearly knew this was bullshit and called my bank .
as i walked into the room i noticed the bad smell and dirty carpets .
later that night i found _num_ huge roaches just crawling on the carpet .
the worst hotel ever !
the room stinks so bad !
everything is old and falling apart .
i stayed here for labor day weekend and it was pretty terrible .
ca n't say i saw any bugs either .
stayed here one night and one night only .
almost thought me and my _num_ friends were not going to survive .
the only nice part of the whole room was the bathroom .
it 's definitely cheap and `` $ _num_ dollars worth '' .
freaking chinese cooking with hot plates in their room .
checked in , was handed keys for front door and room door .
that means she does n't care about my business .
avoid this area like the plague .
come sunday , i arrived at half time .
she assured me that they have never ran out before .
so , i got the cheese steak .
your customer service department is the absolute worst .
i ca n't believe people shop this store , i think they 're terrible .
to each their own , i guess .
_num_ minutes later i left with no help and no purchase .
guess my money is better off spent somewhere i can get help .
terrible experience .
absolute joke .
i wish i could give a big _num_ .
very shitty place .
very bad customer service at the register .
no room service !
place was ok not the greatest .
you have to pay for wi-fi , and it 's not cheap !
there was only _num_ receptionist helping people with _num_ people in line .
i would stay there again but only if it is free .
there were toilet papers on the floor and used hand towels on the rack .
basically , it was gross .
the second night , we needed a bigger room with more beds .
we go down again to explain and get another room .
ok , so we go down again to get another room and guess what ?
i 'm not kidding , those were the actual words they said to us .
this place makes me feel sick .
_num_ - you get what you pay for .
such a disappointment !
scam , scam , scam !
its okay that theres no casinos inside .
but there 's no soft music playing in the lobby neither .
i stayed twice for _num_ days total , i believe i met them all .
our room was _num_ degrees when we checked in .
it is a security problem as anyone can come into our room at anytime .
we could not sleep .
we called expedia and was on the phone for over _num_ hours .
there was nothing they could do for us .
never will return .
no free wifi .
dirty and dated .
not my cup of tea .
we wo n't be seeing that money .
this place is very old and kind of run down .
and the restaurant was horribly expensive .
it was also very conveniently located a half block off the strip .
all said and done , i probably wo n't stay here again .
i stayed here for _num_ nights and the whole time was not that great .
i shrugged it off then proceeded to find the a/c control .
we fell into the nice king sized bed and feel asleep .
not really cold but a bit cooler than it was outside .
i was very displeased with this place .
i did not enjoy staying there and i will not do so ever again .
i do n't even know where to start .
the beds are awful .
it was so loud .
it is not in the greatest area .
the ice in the ice machine tasted bad .
one room was cold and the other room was hot .
their staff were a hit and miss .
also they charge $ _num_ per device every _num_ hours for internet .
it is n't that close .
if i could give them a no star i would .
made my reservation through priceline and turns out they did n't get the reservation .
rooms are no smoking , but first room reeked of cigarette .
the sheets were clean though .
very poor customer service .
the hotel rooms are a bit dated .
very disappointed with royal resorts .
i was excited to see royal resorts was in my budget .
i called the reservations office and talked to randy .
after _num_ business days i had only received a refund for _num_ room .
so i called back and talked to randy again .
he informed me i was not going to get my full refund .
so i called back another day and talked to april .
so i left a message for daniel ford ( the owner ? )
for the second time and still have not received a call back .
never stay at royal resorts .
some things ca n't be helped , i 'm not unreasonable .
i 've heard complaints down the hall of how spread thin people can be .
the staff is absolutely horrible and the facility not well kept .
this place damned near killed my aunt .
do not bring your animal here !
i will forever miss my little guy .
no vet who cares about animals would speak that way about someone 's pet .
he spent night in hospital w iv fluids and antibiotics .
i am hurt and speechless .
the staff , they do n't even see if you need any help !
not even a thank you and the end of my transaction !
did n't like the place walked out as fast as i walked in .
place was a bit dirty .
so i dont understand why this happened .
horrible people !
horrible place !
i will never spend another dollar here again in my life .
i could n't believe this .
they were awesome and sent me lenses for free as a defective item .
my girlfriend was upset and felt insulted by the poor service .
seeing that he generally did n't care either , we walked out .
the burger itself was pretty good , but i doubt i 'd ever return .
it is just nothing special .
the only problem is that this ended up being a long meal .
on top of that , the guacamole burger did n't have guacamole on it .
it was just too bad to deserve a _num_ because of that .
service was incredibly slow .
then when the burgers came , they were n't even good .
they had no flavor whatsoever .
i would n't go back .
meh food .
the worst part was the service .
bottom line ... avoid this place !
there was only _num_ waitress for the entire place ... at lunch time !
burgers are $ _num_ each without sides .
bloody mary was $ _num_ .
again ... ripoff .
burgers were nothing special at all and arrived cold .
calamari appetizer was overcooked .
mediocre food , apathetic management , and a long wait for the food .
no bbq sauce which i thought was weird .
so it was a little dry .
the coconut shrimp was awesome though .
but no .
i ca n't deny it .
i preferred a bit more pink , but i was n't given that option .
simply put , as the _num_ stars state `` meh .
im confused though .
im guessing they had closed down or something and gave the cup for free .
the patty is noticeably bad .
texture was weird too .
coming out , the presentation of food was sloppy too .
it 's cold here , like anywhere indoors in vegas .
neither does the buffalo burger , which we ordered .
the burger was so dry !
glad i tried it , but would n't go back .
it seemed to have gotten worse .
the burgers did not have much flavor to it .
it was very bland .
i got their pull pork sandwich , was n't much flavor going on .
service was pretty slow , it was n't even that busy at all !
service was incredibly slow ... .
the bun was barely toasted and the pork was over salty and dry .
just terrible .
thought we would eat here at the miracle mile shops ; mistake !
and they had the nerve to auto charge for the tips !
heck no !
avoid carlos as your waiter !
getting coffee refills from our server was a little challenging .
i am partial to there dresses , especially when they are on sale .
this location is very small , not a good selection of clothes at all .
service , well not friendly way to busy talking to each other .
too bad , you lost a sale .
not a good location at all .
this poor smiths ... just ugh .
in comparison to my neighborhood smiths , this one is just sad .
dirty , dated , poorly run .
the employees are rude and stupid .
it got the job done but is nothing special .
staff is not very friendly .
rotten lobster more than once .
one more ruined meal and i will never shop here again .
take note , trader joe 's , you 're missing an opportunity !
big mistake .
we had a real horrible experience in the meat counter .
they do n't have the sense to know when they can win or lose .
i hate this smiths .
avoid avoid avoid !
i dread going to this smith 's .
some advice to smith 's : _num_ .
it looks terrible .
worst store ever .
not to mention only self checkout .
no regular lanes !
really bad first time experience here .
had to wait _num_ mins at customer service just to get _num_ dollars back .
bad bad bad .
i 'm letting everyone i know to be careful what you buy here .
i 'm truly disappointed .
she should have said that she only take _num_ items or less .
so i 'm dissatisfied with this smiths store .
please do n't get ripped off like i did and stay away .
oh wait ... i ca n't .
not a bad looking hotel on the outside .
not a bad casino , but the rooms are crap .
you ca n't lock the door when your in the restroom .
being tired and hungry - i did n't concern myself with that .
um ... no .
i think this was the worst pizza i 've ever had in my life .
the pizza was gross .
dry , flavorless , disgusting .
like it had been sitting out for _num_ days .
what a disappointment !
my ex then jumped up and threw us both on the floor .
we did n't think much of it until they got closer .
the planet hollywood casino is a _num_ minute walk away as well .
i had to switch rooms twice due to problems with the rooms .
i could n't get it out of my head for hours .
i was careless and did n't .
just bring your own pillow , blankets and towels .
its very upsetting and were taking this to corporate .
worst motel i 've ever stayed in .
when i reported this they did nothing about it .
the room had a safe , hair dryer , soap and shampoo .
the bad : you get what you pay for .
sheets were low quality .
the front window would n't open .
the walls had cracks and needed paint pretty badly .
the toilet paper was a little rough .
no fridge , mic , coffee maker ( ? )
it was a little noisy but , again , we did sleep .
just plain gross !
was told about this place by friends who had stayed here before .
dirty , gross and nasty !
the room smelled so bad .
the a/c old and very loud .
stale pastries , rotten fruit and stale cereal .
they held my money for days after they posted my payment .
beware of room _num_ if you 're trying to sleep in .
you can hear them talking and laughing while waiting to grab their linen carts .
it was just noisy .
this place is disgusting !
this was the biggest mistake of my trip .
hell , even the name turns me off big time .
this is not even a place i 'd go drunk anymore .
in and out kills this place , you got ta be kidding .
it also takes forever to get your food .
skip it .
i really was n't all that impressed .
the hamburger was dry .
dirty on the outside and horribly crowded on the inside .
first , this place was a mess .
my burger was a disappointment .
the bun tasted a little stale too .
so service was bad .
the burgers and fries are just so-so .
we went here on a late saturday night , approx .
at any rate , i do n't think anything happened .
my bf and i split a cheeseburger meal .
ok , not so bad right ?
wrong .
fat burger , thanks for being there , but never again .
for some reason this location just misses the point !
i know stupid me !
we all did n't have any of the extras included in our burgers .
what a waste !
when i got my order it was wrong .
what a shame !
is n't everything suppose to taste better when you are faded ?
burgers here taste like cardboard .
i ca n't imagine how bad it tastes when i 'm sober .
when the food was finally done , it was burned dry meat .
that baby had the biggest bags under her poor little eyes .
i would never go back .
the served taking my order clearly hated her job and was a bit rude .
the visit was at 4am but it was quite crowded .
welcome to the most ghetto and dangerous place in vegas .
alright , fine , fatburger gets a slight upgrade .
the steak fries ( fat fries ) were good .
nasty .
plain and simple .
the inside of this place is worse than a gas station .
despite that , the burger came out cold .
fries are frozen crap etc etc .
stay the hell out of this place .
this location is a disgrace to fatburger .
wo n't be back to this location .
this place is definitely not as great as everyone makes it seem .
the burgers were alright but nothing special .
wrong !
worst fatburger ever .
honestly , it took about _num_ mins to get _num_ milkshakes .
a lot of the customers in the restaurant seemed unhappy with their service .
i love the fatburger franchise , but this location does it shame .
worst experience ever .
waste of money , stay out of it ... ... !
again , stay out of it ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
worst service ever !
brought the burger no fries ... did n't care .
sent back the entire meal and no manager .
i recently went here during my visit to vegas .
it truly is nothing special and definitely not worth the price !
nothing special about it.
this is only my second yelp review .
saw an employee sitting at a booth eating mcdonald 's breakfast .
see four other employees standing doing nothing .
the rest did n't sell we 'll .
was pointed to where i could get it myself .
not that great .
it was _num_ dollars for two dry burgers and fries .
wishing we went to subway or mcdonalds instead .
while both were good , they really were nothing special .
i had eggs potatoes and toast .
please find some better vegetarian patty recipes ?
the only thing that was not better was the food !
for $ _num_ , this sandwich was not worth it .
food another _num_ later and of course no fries .
someone ran the fried out after we were done and waiting for the bill .
she never checked back !
he told us it was a must try !
it 's hard to keep up with all the competition on the strip .
we should 've turned around when we saw this place was pretty empty .
they also offer chicken and turkey burgers .
the decor is outdated .
this place is a total disaster .
i guess that on some level , i should have been thankful .
this dump really needs to get a handle on its staff .
avoid this one at all costs people .
you 've been warned !
michael the cashier and george the server need to be fired !
michael does not know what the term `` make it a meal means .
the fries were the redeeming factor for this meal since they were sooo good !
dont waste your money , there is next to no alcohol in them .
the worst burger i have ever had .
an awful dining experience .
lower than the corner greasy spoon .
steer far , far away from fatburger .
we could barely understand our what our waitress was saying .
terrible .
price was not cheap ; total _num_ bucks .
was n't a fan .
i did not taste alcohol in the drink and the fries were soggy .
wo n't go back .
worst experience !
the service was ok but their chicken sandwich was absolutely terrible .
never going back .
thoroughly underwhelming .
crispy overdone meat , mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor .
fatburger is all hype .
they 're just overpriced burgers .
i 'm not saying it 's not good , but it 's nothing special .
worst service ever .
very disappointing !
what i got was two thin burgers stacked on top of each other .
that was my first mistake .
total rip-off .
avoid fatburger !
overpriced for burger and service was terrible .
waitress was rude and not friendly at all .
1/3 lbs is way to big for a child .
my meal came up to $ _num_ ( i had lemonade too ) .
the onion rings were plain and nothing special .
just get a double double from in & out .
pretty sure i 'm not coming here again .
this particular fatburger did not make a great first impression on me .
sodas at $ _num_ and bottled water at $ _num_ was a bit pricey .
worst customer service .
ok if this was my business i would fire them !
food was just okay and fries where cold .
fries were cold and the burger overcooked .
wo n't do this again .
burgers are delicious but the waitresses are horrible !
they put on sun glasses and so jerk !
worst fatburger experience ever .
a fatburger , fries and chocolate shake was $ _num_ + change .
parking was $ _num_ .
$ _num_ is way too much for fatburger .
forgetting to add onions or removing pickles etc .
it was just completely wrong !
um no thanks .
i was so disappointed and angry i did n't eat it .
hence why i gave them two stars instead of zero !
the chairs and tables did not look wiped down and the trash was full .
alas , i will not be coming back .
very dry burger not so good and our skinny frys were stale tasted old .
we ordered _num_ burgers , _num_ fries , and _num_ shakes .
disappointed , dissatisfied , never again .
unfortunately , it did not live up and it even somewhat disappointed .
the bad , the price is insane .
i got a turkey burger , chili cheese fries , and a milkshake .
total was $ _num_ .
at in n out , that same meal is $ _num_ .
also , i was not impressed with the fries .
they were definitely not worth the calories .
i got the skinny fries and ended up throwing them out .
this cheese was just meh .
but , then again , when you 're drunk this place is probably heaven .
there are other places worth visiting .
our hamburgers were dry , no flavor or seasoning was used .
ordered chili cheese frys also an they sucked .
we had to wait _num_ minutes before boarding .
the actual flight was just alright .
nothing special .
grand waste of money and time .
the pilot and helicopter was ok , but the view was just lame .
you ca n't feel the depth of grand canyon at all .
worst costumer service ever !
all in all i can not recommend this tour company .
if not that , atleast a polite driver .
ugh , so disappointed and not happy at all with this whatsoever .
i find an add on-line that says private helicopter tours .
here is where it all goes down hill .
we get picked up by a shuttle bus that can only sit _num_ people .
i ended up sitting on my husbands lap the entire way there .
it was not .
no one ever offered us an upgrade nor mentioned it .
issue # _num_ champagne is given to everyone taking the flight .
so no lunch for me .
was it worth the $ _num_ + spent ?
do not waste your money here .
everything about this trip was misleading .
worst .
our pilot didnt say anything and rushed us to board .
spoke directly to a live person on the phone .
please do n't use this company .
this was still more than twice what i was quoted a few days before .
whatever .
if i want m & ms i 'll go to the gas station .
these kinds of stores are a waste of time .
my boyfriend found it pretty boring .
i did n't know it took thirty coats to make the candy shell .
i would n't go to this place again .
warning ... do not watch the 3d movie when you have a massive hangover .
the 3d glasses actually made the movie and my hangover worse .
but the only original flavor was coconut .
i mean c'mon , it m & m 's .
not worth it if you ask me and way too pricey .
this place is pretty cool but totally not worth wasting my money on .
we could barely get around the store without running into someone .
and you saved a bunch of money .
they have different colors , but not a lot of different flavors .
i want to eat m & m 's not advertise for them .
this store was a major disappointment .
even my daughter was bored .
where the heck is the m & m tour ?
utterly a boring waste of time without the tour .
my terribly offensive m & m message read , `` eat me jessica '' .
i was a little surprised that m & m 's would find this offensive .
i would give their customer service _num_ star .
they only responded through emails and never called my phone to discuss the order .
fun to walk through , but damn , everything is expensive .
save your money and buy m & m 's at the regular store .
this was a super boring tourist trap .
not cool !
from reading their website i guess i just expected more .
this was just a uber overpriced m and m gift shop .
the 3d movie they said they had was closed .
the problem is the candy costs i think $ _num_ a pound .
as expected , it 's _num_ floors of m & m 's merchandise .
total tourist trap .
it 's overpriced and cheesy , but still worth at least a quick look .
it 's four floors of m & m merchandise .
ripoff .
this store is not as exciting as it sounds .
it is free and no wonder there is no charge for this ordinary show .
i broke my foot recently and have to wear a boot .
at minimum they should have offered to bring my packaged to the next floor .
had a rough time here last night .
forget it , i 'll just have a vodka and sprite . ''
`` ok , a cranberry vodka coming up . ''
`` no , a vodka and sprite . ''
- we were done with our drinks , sitting there with empty glasses .
even the people who only ordered beers had to wait _num_ minutes .
a lounge on one side with pool tables and a liquor store ?
they do n't comp drinks that they should .
never again will i go back .
i completely understand that you 're gon na chit chat when it 's slow .
she was n't even having an appropriate conversation either .
this is not good customer service .
she should stop talking so much when there is customers and actually work .
the salesperson was incredibly rude and i felt rushed .
she did n't act like she wanted to help me at all .
i just said no because she was so horrible at her job .
thats wrong !
$ _num_ on a thursday night before midnight ?
slow but friendly service .
paid $ _num_ for me and $ _num_ for the bf to get in .
damn ... $ _num_ each + tip !
nothing special nothing terrible just blah ... but for $ _num_ i expected more .
but for me , next time ill just play poker and make money .
this place sucks ... do n't come here .
it gets too crowded .
interior in drai 's is ... .
the _num_ star rating is really a _num_ star rating .
it must be the music ... that 's what gets me coming back .
for me , coming to drai 's would be like going to the gym .
you 're tired , you do n't feel like going .
not to mention all the people watching that you 'll enjoy while burning calories .
come back when it gets crowded and walk right past everybody and go party .
if it were possible there 'd be no star .
that was strike # _num_ for me .
drai 's was a bit of a disappointment .
am i the only one who feels like this ?
the crowd was cool , drinks although pricey were stiff .
i really tried to like it but they played very old slow house .
i do n't know what this guy was playing , but it was bad .
like i said , never again .
i dropped my money on the ground and it rolled a bit .
he proceeded to walk away and ignore me for the next _num_ minutes .
it was just so wrong -- and did i mention gross ... and dirty ?
gross .
i refuse to patronize an establishment like that .
that something in los angeles would be better then vegas .
this club is too dark and low ceilings .
there is no line , there is no order to how you get in .
the staff is clearly not having fun and clearly hate their jobs .
_num_ minutes later the same bouncer says the line is on the left side .
he said u can pay me and i will get u in .
and i usually hear rumors of having problems getting in to a club .
guess i was wrong .
i do n't know how it works here .
the bouncers have major attitude .
i just remember the bouncer , ian , was a total douche bag .
that 's ridiculous .
i really dont understand how people or management let this happen .
why do businesses treat people like crap .
horrible service .
i will not go back !
no thank you .
i have been here twice , excited by the reviews of other yelpers .
both times , i was disappointed .
i will not be back .
there was me , my gf , two other girls and _num_ other guy .
this is normal around vegas , not a big deal .
$ _num_ for guys , $ _num_ for girls .
wrong , not worth it .
music sucked , drinks were weak , vibe was terrible .
complete waste of time and money , two thumbs down .
so sad in this day and age people are still so racist .
if i could give this place a negative stars , i would .
so hubby and friends are waiting on me .
he again , says $ _num_ each .
i also went back to max and asked for his full name .
before we left , i told him he was very rude .
he recognized my friends and did n't say anything and just walked away .
worst dj i 've heard in years .
be prepared to spend _num_ $ a person .
spend my money elsewhere !
stood in line forever , willing to pay whatever and did n't get in .
we find out there 's another side that plays hip hop and top _num_ .
we get there and there 's another bouncer , guess what ?
i came back february of super bowl weekend and probably wo n't return .
oh and there is no reception in there which is creepy .
me and my girlfriend are the only asian girls in line .
would not come here again because i honestly feel disrespected .
i would like to really comment on the issues sober lol .
we answered and he simply said `` wait '' and walked away .
or you can go if you simply wan na get pissed off .
_num_ girls and _num_ guy .
not worth your buzz and not worth your time .
their parking area was n't any better .
we walked so far just to get a taxi .
there was no one there to guide us .
i am so disappointed .
they should remove the word service from table service as there was none .
never again will go to this place .
very rude .
many other places who wo n't disrespect you for no reason .
worst customer service ever .
i like to club but not at places like this .
get over yourself its a job not a career .
horrible experience at drai 's after hours !
poor customer service and treatment by staff !
i would never return or recommend this club to anyone !
very rude security .
hotel security claims they do n't have any control over the club security .
having one employee and a supervisor that can not communicate with customers is ridiculous .
they will not get any more of my money .
i ca n't believe how rude the employees are at this location .
they have n't attended anyone yet .
do not visit this location !
if i could give zero stars i would .
owner was on site and did nothing to correct all the errors .
not ok !
it was very embarrassing that i had to show him that cake .
i could have ordered from smiths and it would have been better .
next time i 'm going to have fat boys ice cream .
i have been to this location twice in the past week during lunch .
i ordered three snack wraps and fudge stuffed cookie .
it took about _num_ minutes for me to receive my food .
it was also overcooked .
not to mention , he had no idea what goes in each blizzard .
drove all the way from henderson to stratosphere area to get this cake .
looked like a child decorated it also no cookie dough inside the cake .
ok well get ur dad on the phone .
they would n't give me the owners name .
i 've never been treated this way .
they lack customer service and no empathy .
so i wait a hour get down here .
please see the picture this is ridiculous .
why do you have a attitude with me .
quit if you do n't like it .
they are blue ... horrible experience .
wish i had n't of paid ahead .
wow , this shave was the opposite of enjoyable .
yes , blame your shoddy work and ill preparation on your client .
terrible service on all levels .
repeated attempts to upsell expensive extras .
before going to vegas , i checked out all the prices of the salons .
yup , total rip off on advertising and real pricing .
even for vegas , this place is a rip off .
desperate and pathetic !
it was a terrible experience .
went for my bridal hair and makeup and was extremely disappointed !
horrible service , female bartender was very rude .
not a classy place if thats what you are looking for .
why would they get rid of the original sign out front ?
it was amazing the new sign is ridiculous .
giving it a one to keep the ( other ) tourists away .
spent about $ _num_ in one weekend at guess alone a few months ago .
i am so disappointed and frustrated with guess .
well , apparently guess is not one of those places .
high prices , cheap material and horrible customer service .
which is a puppy mill and the papers of are worthless .
horrible !
dogs are kept in horrid conditions as well .
staff is very rude !
worst pet store in vegas !
the staff are so rude , do not like to help you .
someone could easily run out with one of the dogs !
do not support this business !
you can grab $ _num_ blackjack .
yeah , the tables are so crowded it 's hard to find a spot .
q : this place is awful .
a : no !
trust me , twenty bucks goes a long way at this place .
another two words : cheap .
q : honestly , this place is just sad .
look at those dealers with dead , dead eyes .
why even bother ?
this place is a dump .
we used to go here all the time for cheap craps .
when i went tonight , it was a $ _num_ minimum .
lame .
on top of that , most of the dealers were rude assholes .
meh , i wo n't be bringing people around here anymore .
this review is only for the casino , not the hotel .
and you 'll still only get $ _num_ .
their other deals also were too confusing or impossible to even care about .
customer service is not something that the casino royale hotel should be known for .
we received no call , and checked in at 1pm .
what i got was a really shitty bun ( super dry and old ) .
the hot dog itself was ok , but more lukewarm if anything .
unfortunately , this hot dog did n't .
very cheap and stale .
no other specials ( fitness room or even breakfast ) available to guests .
very small too .
couple hundred and no returns , not even a small win .
yeah , that was enough for me to forget about it .
they should call it fun paper instead of fun book .
totally misleading .
there are better casinos in vegas .
for years , this place had been my favorite casino on the strip .
$ _num_ crap table during the day ; $ _num_ on the weekend .
but on my last trip , the dealers were so slow .
in a word , disappointing .
_num_ craps table open at 11pm thursday night .
thanks but no thanks .
the one redeeming factor ?
$ _num_ beers .
grab several and get the hell out of there !
nobody should patronize this establishment .
never stayed here and never will .
they have cheap tables , i mean $ _num_ craps , really ?
but there are only a few tables opened , one for each game .
slots are limited and dated .
also , was not approached by a waitress at all .
the only way to win is by hitting the jackpot .
they do have a cheap gift shop when you walk in but its small .
could have went somewhere else in my limited time .
like hello i 'm trying to drink here .
i used to really like this casino .
disappointed !
this is specifically about the casino crap table .
this was last saturday evening , the 16th at approximately _num_ .
they were very rude and clearly disinterested in doing their job .
not helpful at all .
i will not be going back to the royal casino .
service is dead there .
not a fan .
do not go to casino royale in vegas .
ok , so check this out .
i got ripped off by their `` first $ _num_ on us '' promotion .
i then went back to the desk to claim the promotion .
she just said it all like it was completely obvious .
the slots manager was even worse than the woman at the desk .
they would above and beyond bad customer experience .
i did n't even care that i was out twenty bucks .
but did they have to be so rude about it ?
their job is to keep the casino 's money , i get that .
usually , you see the same slots everywhere .
the cocktail waitresses seemed a little bored and tired of being there .
there 's no theme to this place !
it 's just kind of an ugly casino .
i wo n't be back .
and why ca n't they tell you if you ask ?
talk about one step beyond bad service !
i repeat do not stay here .
some of the locals were extremely creepy .
the food was decent .
rude !
sadly this one did n't cut it .
service was ok but not exceptional , booth was tidy but not clean .
i would probably go again just for convenience but would not recommend this restaurant .
our visit did not begin well .
after he seated them , he sat us , two hispanic women .
after the iced tea that we ordered finally arrived , we checked out .
now the bad .
the food was n't all that great .
there was a small white bug crawling on the knife .
just so disappointed in the manager .
my visit to this applebee 's was not a pleasant experience .
the servers were short and directly insulting .
do not order the _num_ cheese macaroni with honey pepper .
i would not recommend coming here for a good dining experience .
first off the waiter was not aware of the happy hour specials .
we get our food and my mash potatoes were cold .
next i go to eat my pasta and it was very dry .
everyone working there seemed like they were new and did n't know a thing .
_num_ strikes you 're out !
i had the steak , mixed veggies , and mashed potatoes .
a little overly done .
the potatoes were alright but nothing to great .
he was pretty much just chewing a flavored piece of bone and fat .
in fact all of our food was overcooked .
i stood at the door for at least _num_ minutes before being acknowledged .
she gave us menus and took our drink orders immediately .
one of my favorites are the double crunch wings with the asian chile sauce .
we ordered those and they came out soggy and loose .
he never even came back .
i feel our whole meal should 've been comped but it was n't .
but she really gave _num_ star service !
she was so much more accommodating than the manager dave the entire night !
then it took a waitress _num_ min .
_num_ min .
still no drinks .
this was without a doubt the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
the hostess would n't look at us .
my girlfriend ordered a thai shrimp salad .
( it came with no shrimp ) i ordered the honey pepper chicken pasta .
the chicken was very small and rock hard .
we informed the waitress that our orders were wrong .
she left and never came back .
i could not taste them at all if that was true .
never going to applebee 's again .
slow service .
food not good .
would not recommend coming here .
worst steak i have ever had for $ _num_ !
it came with shrimp that was rubbery and cold .
such a big waste of money !
server was great but lousy food !
me and my girlfriend visit this location often at least _num_ times a month .
tonight was horrible , the night started off waiting 20+ minutes for water .
the chips and salsa was covered in salt .
they covered our check but we did not finish the meal and left immediately .
horrible !
horrible service .
two starving kids ordered appetizers and kids meals to come out first .
_num_ minutes later our dinner salads came out .
at _num_ minutes cancelled apps .
still no kids meals .
needless to say it all came out together at about _num_ minutes .
my bad , but i trusted the waiter .
plus i gave him over a _num_ % tip !
you 've been warned .
my waiter made it an even worst experience ever .
the food was being rushed .
we ordered a bottle of moroccan wine for $ _num_ .
_num_ stars only because there was a belly dancer .
my tastebuds were more excited during free lunch in the employee dining room today .
the final shot of tea tasted like starbucks black tea with honey .
at _num_ bucks a pop normally , i felt that it is seriously overpriced .
very expensive with no choices .
we also , purchases a groupon , and we tried to get reservations .
then , that evening , i was delayed in an out of town airport .
we walked in at _num_ pm and were asked how many .
the gentleman then said , `` we do n't have availability tonight . ''
the restaurant was empty .
the food was extra blah with no seasoning or spice .
the first course was shrimp scampi , not bad but not impressive .
this is n't moroccan food .
i 'm sorry but it definitely was not worth it .
fake moroccan restaurant .
if i could give them zero stars i would !
they would n't even let my parents wait inside for a cab !
so disappointed !
they came out quickly and were quite tasty .
there was plenty of bread and hummus left for dipping .
it had been _num_ minutes since the waiter stopped by .
_num_ more minutes passed as we tried to get the waiter 's attention .
we had now been waiting _num_ minutes for the chicken to come .
we let it go and a few moments later we got our bland chicken .
the moral of the story : do n't keep the hummus !
not tasty .
disappointing in every respect .
trust me , the taste of dishes could not have been more disappointing .
well , some slices of carrots , too .
now for the dessert .
and that was the only entertainment offered for the new year 's eve .
another bad idea , gentlemen .
but you get used to it , so ok for a change .
all in all , we could not have been more disappointed by the restaurant .
most of the food was neither moroccan nor particularly tasty .
this was a complete waste of time , money and diet calories .
do n't get me wrong , i do n't mind spending money .
- course _num_ : moroccan style shrimp scampi - this was n't bad .
- dessert : tasted like banana nutella crepes .
- wine : nothing much to write home about .
terrible service policies .
i absolutely will not go back to this place .
the first place received was breads , humus , olives , etc .
just wo n't be returning since food and service is too important .
that i did n't really like .
oh , & the bread was n't pita bread .
i was n't pleased with the bland , round white bread offered .
# _num_ - beef kabobs , too well done for me .
one of the reasons i do n't like pre set menus .
the music : too loud for talking !
wo n't be going there again .
cons : not worth $ _num_ for dinner .
bread was okay , nothing special , clearly purchased from a factory .
ca n't go wrong with hummus and cucumbers .
chicken was pretty good .
large portions , my party of _num_ had plenty of food to go around .
do you want someone to spend money once or many times ?
i did n't even want to give them a star .
there were _num_ of us .
i could n't hear what his name was so i asked him again .
he the whole time telling us about the menu he just annoyed and irritated .
and he walks off ... again .
and once again i ( we ) would not recommend this place to anyone .
: - ( $ _num_ wasted .
beef kabobs were not well seasoned and had no flavor .
the belly dancer was five stars , .
the food was not good to me .
the main course tasted very bland like i would make at home .
just not happy .
went for my fiance 's birthday this past weekend with some out-of-town friends .
unfortunately , the service was something left to be desired .
our main waiter was not very attentive and was slightly rude at times .
tent looks dark and dingy rather than exotic !
pretty sad experience all in all .
not us .
do not use this office .
even if the doctor cares , his front line workers dont .
dr. w : `` you need to quit . ''
so , i was billed $ _num_ for a _num_ minute `` conversation . ''
this is a little ridiculous .
what kind of crap is this ?
i had a bad experience that was similar to amy 's .
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
costumer service is ok until you try to return something because its damaged .
sadly the stylist samantha ruined my _num_ year old daughters beautiful hair .
but once it was done it looked nothing like the picture .
my child left the salon started crying .
she even refused to go to school .
i contacted the salon owner mary .
she also had this smelly odor that bothered me so much , ew .
i 'm not sure what all the fuss is about .
when my curry rice arrived , i looked at my meal with disappointment .
it was an average amount , and the vegetables were only carrots and onions .
on top of the rice there was pickled ginger .
he then remembered why he had n't been back .
he was disappointed the last time and he was disappointed again .
i was very disappointed !
we first walked in , not knowing what to expect .
not great or anything .
i love getting pizza by the slice , but this was awful .
dudes , no !
the breadsticks were soaked in garlic butter and just tasted awkward .
avoid at all costs .
do i need this food so i do n't die ?
it is not worth your time .
horrible service .
really rude black female manager .
makes bally 's hotel look bad .
poor service .
arrogant annoying staff .
worlds most pathetic pasta and sides of potatoes .
the manager david is rude and very professional .
pasta is nasty .
employees are careless and annoying .
i hate this place .
this was the worst restaurant i have ever been to .
disgusting : the lettuce was lacking in romaine hearts , and was actually wilted .
not sliced fruit , but whole fruits .
so bad we couldnt even get mad .
the bill was $ _num_ for _num_ and left a _num_ % tip .
he took me there for my birthday last night and i was underwhelmed .
the menu is as old school as menus get .
they tasted ok and were cooked nicely .
none of it was great .
if you 're a young , foodie type , skip this restaurant .
bottom line is that this place is just not worth the money .
$ _num_ for a caesar ?
$ _num_ for a sirloin ?
$ _num_ for french onion soup ?
those eating the salad said it was bland .
for the entree , three ordered the petite filet ( $ _num_ each ) .
all three were disappointed .
i got the sirloin ( $ _num_ ) .
there was nothing special about the asparagus .
following our disappointing dinner , the dessert tray was presented .
all of us said we were not going to continue to be disappointed .
the bill with tax and tip was about $ _num_ .
the value is simply no longer there .
there are too many other choices in las vegas .
huge !
very over priced food was average at best .
prices - outrageous for mediocre food .
any steakhouse on the strip is a better option .
starters - complimentary tray of olives , etc ... .
shrimp scampi $ _num_ sent back because shrimp were so fishy .
replaced it with chicken sicilian for $ _num_ .
complimentary dessert platter with fruit and chocolate .
but just ignored it .
the manager jose came and was rude but at the end made an exception .
secondly , we were just stunned !
we were so embarrassed and frankly shocked we did n't know what to say .
the food was very expensive , which i knew going in .
the food , however , fell far short of the price .
the wait staff was attentive .
went to this store to change out a battery .
worse yet , water got inside from washing my hands .
i do not recommend this place .
this place is ridiculous .
big mistake .
ridiculous .
not to impressed with this place .
its a run down bar and the only reason why i was here .
stock is n't that great , had four out of five taps empty .
half of their slots on the bar was n't working .
can i give less then _num_ star ?
they are that horrible !
this is the last towing company that i would call .
they take no pride in anything .
do not use these people !
skip them !
she said `` okay goodbye '' quickly and hung up the phone .
wrong move for someone in customer service .
if you need a towing service , look elsewhere .
avoid these inconsiderate morons .
she said `` okay goodbye '' quickly and hung up the phone .
wrong move for someone in customer service .
all about money money money .
i 'm only giving them _num_ star because i ca n't give _num_ .
worst people i have ever encountered .
everything 's broken .
no way to get your money back .
i hate you starbucks !
i was standing close enough to hear everything .
no , you never know what they 'll do to your drink .
overall , i am completely horrified at my experience at cesar 's palace .
shame shame shame !
the bag did not came with a box , only a dust bag .
did not return any of my message !
i have never ever encountered this kind of poor customer service .
the hotel is not worth the money .
the beds are hard and the staff were rude .
the casino was good the cocktail waitresses were on it .
this place is screaming for some upgrades !
do yourself a favor and skip this .
sheets good quality , but never changed during _num_ night stay .
probably the worst hotel on the strip .
i will not stay at another mgm property ever again .
step right up !
what the hell is this ?
i found myself ( as well as my bf ) just wandering around unimpressed .
overall a bit run down and pretty lame prizes .
had to search out employees to fix machines and get tickets .
very disappointed with this place .
i 'd give this place zero stars .
it seems a quarter of the games are broken but still take your credit .
not a place i would recommend .
it is a waste of money .
we spent $ _num_ in a matter of minutes .
the games do not last long enough for you to feel satisfied .
how disappointing .
claw machines are very hard to win prizes .
and do n't waste the money .
stayed in alot of shady vegas hotels .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
the supervisor argued with us and basically told us we were lying .
and i 'm vegan ... yeah , this was n't pretty .
they put the veggie burger on wheat bread .
and if it was , that is so not right .
the waitress was accomodating and took it off the bill .
i would not waste my time on this one again .
decor and memorabilia were just okay .
_num_ service was messy .
not even close .
ohhh and i am huge brisket fan and this was tough and dry .
mediocre service and mildly interesting atmosphere .
and a gigantic american flag made of chains !
it tasted almost salty with hardly any melon flavor .
it was like spinach dip for people who do n't like spinach .
disappointing .
service was fast but pretty lackluster .
this place should not say that they have the best bbq in vegas .
that would mean that vegas has the worst bbq in the world .
first ate here in _num_ .
but now , there is neither .
bad food and lousy service .
eating here today , we were very disappointed .
the pulled pork tasted processed and like it was cooked in the microwave .
seriously , do n't come here for the food .
but not for the food .
i made the mistake of ordering chili with my fries .
i love food and my standards are low .
but even this was below it .
the bbq brisket sandwhich was n't good .
the brisket was dry and tough like strips of leather covered in bbq sauce .
the portion size was so tiny , a major disappointment on my end .
we were seated promptly and drinks ordered .
this was ridiculous .
however , due to the slow service we will not try this place again .
the french fry : chili ratio was also pretty weak .
waitress stole my phone .
we sit at garden so it is not so loud and crowded .
my father ate t-bone steak .
after seconds i 've realized that my phone was gone but she was nowhere .
after like 2-3 minutes she came and she of course knows nothing .
in seconds my phone was gone and only waitress came to our table .
i had lunch here today with family from out of state ... .
they were so bad .
there ranch was like hidden valley you get from the bottle .
the pork tasted bland .
there was hardly any barbecue sauce .
i order breakfast and it was not very impressive at all .
you know it 's bad when the eggs have no taste and served cold .
not to mention there were flies everywhere .
i will not eat here again and i do n't recommend it .
it was the worst steak i 've ever been served by a restaurant .
very chewy and overcooked .
the rest of the food was mediocre , as was the service .
wish we 'd dined elsewhere .
`` no , that is the way they are priced .
gross gross gross .
and the vegas strip was packed ( guess vegas is back ) .
gross .
gross obviously from a plastic container no way smoked in house .
gross .
pretty much the opposite of fall off the bone .
again , gross .
gross .
terrible country fried steak very oily .
it taste like a chicken nugget from mcdonalds .
they have really bad service .
our waiter was n't very welcoming , not even a smile or greeting .
the mashed potatoes were instant potatoes .
their string beans were nothing special .
i wo n't recommend this place to anyone , not even my worst enemy !
fail .
dear god it was aweful .
this place is a disgrace to bbq and the harley name .
do n't really know where to start with the food .
the ribs were far from fall of the bone .
it was hard to cut them with a knife `` gross '' .
i wo n't be back .
if it was just based off of the food it would get _num_ stars .
the current rating on yelp ( 2-3 stars ) is pretty accurate .
unfortunately , it appeared to be of the frozen variety .
the meat is dried out and just is n't that great .
the burgers might have been better , but i did n't try them .
avoid the chicken sliders .
it 's simply mediocre .
sad to have to give this two stars .
but this used to be one of our favorite vegas stops .
but the meal was over priced and not good .
the fries were cold and dry .
we wo n't be going back .
just walking into this establishment , really does n't impress me .
however , the service and food were average to a bit below average .
seriously outdated and food was subpar .
not to mention it was filthy !
i was pretty disappointed , guess we should have read the reviews before stopping .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i am sorry i wasted my time !
worst bbq i have ever had .
the food is terrible and so is the service .
i got the burger and fries and it was pricey and tasted like cardboard .
rip off - eat somewhere else .
this place was packed and i do n't understand why .
wo n't go back .
on top of that , the bathroom was filthy .
food was okay , nothing special .
when we got out bill , we noticed an _num_ % gratuity automatically added .
never again .
if you like dry ass chicken , go here .
the service was good but the food had no taste at all .
bad cafeteria type food .
if we were n't starving we would have sent it back .
would n't recommend at all .
we have the fajitas , which was cold , and the southern fried chicken .
the brisket was undercooked and tough .
they try to cover that fact with a ton of bbq sauce .
it sucks for the staff there because they were pretty good .
we recently went to vegas and had dinner here .
bad experience here 1st and last time i 'd visit .
if you like ribs ... keep walking .
seriously , the most bland and boring ribs on the planet .
i gave them one star because the chicken corn chowder was not bad .
the food was very average at best .
i ordered the st louis bbq ribs and it basically had no taste .
just i went for breakfast this morning to this place .
hostess did smile or try to make any conversation .
i wo n't come here again .
_num_ stars because the food is edible .
but the service was absolutely horrible .
it took forever to get drinks and food even though the place was dead .
server screwed up ticket and was extremely slow .
my boyfriend and i went to this place because we wanted barbecue .
we got seated quickly since it was basically empty ... .
the onion rings were the worst i 've ever had .
i got halfway through my second one and started feeling sick .
the portions were so far off .
do n't even get me started on our waitress .
she didnt check on us for over _num_ minutes .
all in all , worst restaurant experience ever .
the decor and ambience is tacky .
this will teach me to read reviews before i walk into a place .
the pulled pork was not at all good and bottom bun was soggy .
an employee said it was down for maintenance for a month or so .
it was hard as a rock .
the waiter did n't bother to ask how my food was .
this place was just alright .
i had a cali burger and only ate half of it !
total bullshit .
over cooked and not worth your time .
the wings where hard and dry .
wish i left before we order .
i waited _num_ minutes on a not busy wednesday night by myself .
it was disgusting .
worst service and food you can get in las vegas .
food is bad !
there was _num_ of us this time and everyone agreed it was bad food .
do n't go here , they are so rude !
left and went down to fat burger and got treated like royalty !
you failed big time !
and the waitress never smiled the entire time .
food was decent but i probably will not be back .
we came here for their breakfast/brunch and it was pretty awful .
they also had egg fu young , which was also yuck !
i know what a good chinese breakfast is and this sure is n't it !
service was a little slow and the food was just plain blah .
okay , so part of the one star rating is my own fault .
i was n't even hungover when i woke up .
mid grade hotel ... attempt at mass appeal acceptable .
reasonably priced ( but only for vegas .
chin chin at new york , new york .
way too salty and nasty .
highly disappointed !
we were tired and placed a `` pick up '' order .
the eggplant was super greasy and the lo mein noodles were dry .
this place should be called salt salt instead !
i could n't eat it !
hubby ordered the pepper beef and it was n't too bad .
the food- they serve the usual breakfast fare .
eggs , bacon , sausage , and french toast .
it is $ _num_ a person .
hell you can go to circus circus breakfast buffet and get better .
they did n't even have toast here !
silly me to think that a breakfast buffet would serve toast ... silly me .
p.s they do n't serve toast !
i was n't impressed with this place and would n't recommend it to people .
the yellow tail tuna sashimi was ok .
it was dry and did n't taste fresh at all .
it was edible and thankfully did n't taste stale at least !
the chicken fried rice barely had any flavour in it .
overpriced and not worth it .
not going there again .
i would not recommend eating here .
so , we asked to see menus again .
try to avoid this place at ny ny if possible .
there are much better asian options elsewhere .
it 's expensive yet nothing special about the food .
the service is slow .
by far the worst sushi i have ever had .
the rainbow roll was terrible !
not here .
our table shared some other `` traditional '' chinese dishes and they all sucked .
to top everything off , the service was one of the worst .
i overheard two separate strangers that chin chin had great chinese food .
being in new york new york i expected at least mediocre chinese food .
this was definitely the worst chinese food i have ever eaten .
any dive buffet in any town would have far superior food .
chin chin 's service was the worst we have had in vegas as well !
skip this place at all costs .
my pineapple fried rice was way too salty .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
we ate at chin chin this past week with friends .
i was starving and was really wanting that chicken !
however , the food is just missing its mark .
service was not .
although the waiter was friendly , he totally forgot our first course .
did n't realize it until we asked where our soups were .
horrible customer service .
didnt even bother to check back on our table after the incident .
i would spend you money elsewhere .
food is totally tasteless , big portions , atmosphere poor .
the sashimi was ok , comparable to grocery store grade .
the only enjoyable part of the meal was the shu mai which was decent .
the food was a disappointment , though .
the sushi was supermarket grade at best -- stay away from it !
the mongolian beef , however , was pretty good .
the bf and i ordered the orange beef and singapore noodles .
my noodles were so incredibly dry and had very little meat .
it was incredibly bland .
well , unfortunately i was n't wrong .
it was ok but nothing special .
and to add insult to injury , i was super thirsty after my meal .
unfortunately , it 's not for me .
the following email was sent to the management at chin chin .
there was no response .
she also said she would add more meats next time .
too bad there wo n't be a `` next time '' .
it was convenient and we were in the mood for chinese food .
the tuna tartar was also disappointing .
in the end , you have _num_ very unhappy customers .
not impressed , nothing special .
the sushi roll was delish .
very lame .
all in all a total disappointment .
we will not be back .
i ate here the other night with three dining companions .
my dining companions split both the edamame and star wontons for appetizers .
however i found the dish to be weird , especially the cucumber pieces .
the only other thing of note is that my friends ordered three sushi rolls .
they were disappointed with the size of them but raved about the flavors .
the bottom line for me is that i would probably not eat here again .
went to this restaurant in june of _num_ for lunch .
the food tasted sub-par at best .
several hours later , my companion was throwing up for the next _num_ hours .
had to seek medical attention , a doctor was called to our room .
she could not eat at all , and we just stayed in .
as i am getting no responses from either chin chin corporate or ny ny .
chow fun was bland even thought it looked favorable .
the beef tasted a lil sour .
teriyaki bowl was terrible .
chicken was way over cooked and dry ... kind of hard .
the sauce was did not taste like teriyaki sauce .
the california rolls were pretty good though .
the low point was the peanut noodles with chicken .
two bites , pushed it away .
seriously , i do n't think they even realize it 's bad .
the food is expansive and too salty , no test at all .
place was not good .
food taste bland and it is way over priced for what you get .
orange chicken was nasty and so was the fried rice .
wo n't be coming back here .
the service was very slow .
service workers were cold and appeared to want you in and out .
probably would n't go back .
within _num_ hours of eating here , i got sick to my stomach .
it just comes out a little crunchy and unpleasant in the center .
oh , and the fruit is sour .
if you want sushi , avoid it .
not a japanese restaurant .
the food is awful .
to me , chow mein means fried noodles .
and the tofu was cold in the middle .
apparently it was typical fried lemon chicken .
ca n't really go wrong .
for me it was not worth the $ _num_ .
wanted to treat family members to a nice dinner , but was so disappointed !
i could n't even cut it with a knife !
the noodles had a bad texture and flavor ; they tasted old & gummy .
most chinese restaurants include rice with their entrees .
i would n't have minded the high price if the food was good .
everything is overpriced for the poor quality fish .
avoid this place , or just order the kung pao chicken .
you can never go wrong with that .
but at this price , you 'd be better off at panda express .
consider chin chin as a step up from p.f .
chang 's , only with sushi .
it 's gross !
steamed rice was very dry .
would not recommend .
the worst wait staff i have experienced in a long time .
not worth visiting .
i was in here for dinner while on vacation .
for a friday night , i was amazed how empty this place was .
for that kind of price there are simply better options while in vegas .
i would rate it a _num_ out of _num_ .
very little vegetable .
really only celery , which tasted pretty good .
the sauce was nothing special .
the whole meal was marginal at best .
skip this place or try their sushi , and go somewhere else .
our first night in vegas we ate here .
we ordered miso soup and told the waiter it was really salty .
then the manager came over and kindly offered to redo my plate .
potatoes still raw but no one even asked !
no refill of water , coffee or oj !
then i ordered the cream cheese wontons .
in fact they dont have any of the fried dim sum .
they are n't apologetic about it at all .
so i went ahead and just ordered the crispy honey shrimp .
it seemed ... dry ?
i 'm not sure how to explain it .
maybe it was the evening but the food was mediocre and service was slow .
the drinks took _num_ minutes .
the wait staff was pleasant but slow .
i would skip this place and find something more appealing .
and some sort of egg roll ... still not sure what was inside .
the wait staff looked really unhappy .
it was just ok .
my husband and i went to chin chin on friday night may _num_ _num_ .
the first and only bite i took i realized it had mayo inside .
too bad i do n't have a little allergy .
i am incredibly disappointed in the experience we had .
no no .
the potstickers smelled like ass and tasted plain .
it was not good .
find another chinese restaurant .
the service was bad .
poor service !
when we finally got our food we were very disappointed .
the noodles were overpowered in soy sauce and the shrimp and scallops were over .
the dumplings were absolutely tasteless ... .
if you can afford something else in ny , ny , go elsewhere .
very pedestrian and underwhelming .
do n't make that mistake .
it was definitely a poor man 's pf changs .
sushi was very low rated .
pad thai was terrible .
honey shrimp was ok .
this place is bad .
the service is awful .
so that was $ _num_ wasted .
drink prices were insane , so we skipped on those .
overall i feel like this place is way overpriced for mediocre food .
it 'd be a hard sell getting me back in here again .
bad customer service .
not coming bank and wo n't recommend to my friends .
all we got was tofu in pepper with no salt !
could not eat it with rice .
terrible food .
total rip off .
not a place i would return to .
but then again this is las vegas .
i 'm sure your money will buy you much more someplace else .
bad idea ... .
egg roll was burnt yet not cooked so not sure how that happened .
until then , there 's chin chin .
i 'm not picky ... okay , yes i am .
our beans and chicken dishes were covered in salt .
the rice was dry .
the only thing that was made right was our spicy tuna sushi .
worst food and service ever !
took a really long time to get our food .
ice cream was not served when it 's part of my children 's meal .
my food was also cold .
_num_ bucks later , huge disappointment !
i do not recommend this place nor will i ever enter this place again .
if i can give a no star , totally would .
the place was mostly empty with very slow service .
not fresh at all .
the spicy tuna was so over the top spicy , we sent it back .
we started off with an awesome server , who took our drinks order .
the dish also lacked shrimp .
however , there was an abundance of chicken which i could have done without .
i barely finished my pad tai ; it was too intense for my palate .
plus a better attitude could have gone a long way .
this place was horrible .
the hot n sour soap came out cold and was way too salty .
the roasted meats tasted like they had been sitting for days .
avoid this place .
_num_ for crap !
i also did not get the extra almonds i specifically requested .
this left me very dissatisfied and disappointed .
when i think of vegas , i think of good dining .
this place does not belong there .
no one told us we had to pay gratuity on a group of _num_ .
dash ... just the thought of dining , makes me ill .
food was crappy .
it 's a shame .
wish the portions were smaller and cheaper .
no one in our party was impressed .
overall , not impressed .
las vegas version , not so much .
not in this case .
the taste was just way off .
my friend had the cashew chicken which was good , but lacked flavor .
but unfortunately the bad tasting chicken left a horrible taste in my mouth .
would probably not go back .
not just for egg rolls .
i tried three different dishes and could n't finish any of them .
pathetic .
over priced , greasy crap .
worst meal we had all week while in town .
the buffet was not that good for a las vegas buffet .
the passion fruit mojito was good but the service was not .
maybe nye was just a bad day for this restaurant .
the wor wonton soup was just ok .
took _num_ minutes to get beer .
_num_ minutes for our steamed dumpling entree of shu mai .
and _num_ minutes for main .
none of us were impressed .
the staff took it off my bill , which i appreciated .
i 've never had so much sauce in fried rice before .
mongolian beef : again , so much sauce !
the meat slices were too thick and chewy .
if you 're thinking about getting asian food ... do n't eat here !
seriously one of the worst chinese food ever !
horrible food .
our food was cold and extremely salty .
honestly you would be better off going to panda express .
omg chin chin was such a horrible decision for a proper asian dinner !
over all poorly ran , poorly staffed , and low quality .
actual food itself was not really all that impressive .
seriously , have to pay extra for rice in a chinese restaurant .
wow the quality of chinese food is horrible .
very disappointed !
noodles , fried rice and mongolian beef was cold .
not warm .
cold !
the server was working multiple stations and could not provide adequate service .
this was a wednesday night with no crowd .
check came $ _num_ but no desert .
only reason i gave one star is they ca n't go any lower .
lost my business for a lifetime .
not one aspect of our visit was enough to ever go back .
not only thumbs down but a whole hand , arm and entire body down .
so bad service in my life .
, celery , and mushrooms .
this was so disappointing .
i have no idea why i had to check this place out .
probably because i was drunk .
at the same time , we walked in very disappointed .
drinks are overpriced , but it 's vegas .
you wo n't be disappointed .
i think we stayed no more than _num_ minutes .
been here twice and both times i left within _num_ minutes .
girls get free shots for a reason , they would n't get people otherwise !
just do n't go .
its a complete waste of time .
the ratio of guys to girls was at least _num_ to _num_ .
no cover to enter on the thursday night i visited .
there are girls on the bar , but none of them were cute .
they just let anyone go up there apparently .
no one was dancing unless they were on the bar .
there are like _num_ guys to _num_ girls ( if that ) .
more like freaking horrific absolutely terrible shit !
it was shit , like shit shit .
there 's a charge and ugly people two stepping on a small stage .
seriously just do n't !
i 'm not even sure what hotel this place is in .
but there 's better places to spend your time in vegas .
i 've never been to a place this packed .
there 's no where to go .
ca n't comment on the drinks .
luckily we did n't have to pay cover that night .
dead dead dead !
there was no cover .
you have the bartenders ( hot ) up on the bar selling it hard .
i will give coyote ugly props for playing some rock inspired music .
got dragged here by a friend who always wanted to check it out .
i figured since we were in vegas , why not .
should of said hell no instead .
my friends on the other hand had to pay _num_ bucks each .
ya , this place was pretty lame .
none , that was the only reason i went .
after it being forced in my mouth it tasted more like fruit punch .
$ _num_ for a corona , ill pass !
avoid at all costs !
this place was such a huge disappointment .
to add to things , the music was pretty lame .
it is so stupid .
i guess i mean to say , it 's nothing like the movie !
sure , why not ?
anyway , we all got in ... to find a near empty club .
being an expensive silk number , his girlfriend saved it just in time .
but i do n't think i 'll give it a third chance .
this place is horrible .
wow was i wrong .
the only saving grace was cheap beers and free cover .
the bar itself is nothing special .
but hey , i feel for them .
it definitely does not look easy .
just a bad business move in my opinion .
after about an hour or less of hanging out there , we left .
this was not a fun experience !
the bar was so small and so packed that you could n't move .
i told the bouncer and he did not care .
bad business , i do not recommend .
ugh .
this place sucks .
the coyote ugly girls are awful .
the mc had the most ear piercing voice and even worse singing voice .
save your time , save your money , go to diablo cantina .
yeah this place is horrible .
paying $ _num_ just to come here , what the fuck !
also , i thought the one here in ny was a bad spot .
the one in vegas is worse .
i guess my group kind of stood out .
this rough and rowdy bar scene was just not for us .
this place is way too dark and has way too much yelling .
not my idea of a good night .
um wrong !
please do n't wear a skirt .
ugh , see yea coyote ugly .
i mean , really early .
the first thing we did was get some breakfast .
so , naturally , we grabbed some beers and started wandering around the strip .
i never made it back to get my refill though , which sucks .
too much cheese and i 'm not talking mozzarella .
i am talking cheese as in cheesy !
omg horrible !
everyone was standing around looking at her like she was crazy .
we could n't get out of there fast enough !
big disappointment !
i 'm kind of embarrassed to admit i even went here .
unless that is your scene , expect to be bored out of your mind .
but the atmosphere was really lame .
i ca n't really describe it any better or in any further detail .
the bar was pretty lame .
i was expecting it to be much better .
i also hated the water throwing thing !
i hate the male bartender here too .
i am not sure why anyone would go here .
are you desperate and have n't gotten any action in years or something ?
maybe this is the only place you feel like you could see some skin ?
the drinks are somewhat overpriced , and it 's just not any fun .
i say skip it and go elsewhere .
this place is an absolute dump .
as a guy , the bartenders there are absolutely nothing to get excited about .
i was disappointed .
the place was just not my scene at all .
this place is awful .
i ran away screaming .
so we went in .
pricey drinks and rude bartenders .
drinks were n't super and the girls looked rather bored .
i guess i 'm not the target audience here , but still .
volume was way too loud by the way .
i walked in and out in about _num_ minutes .
do n't bother .
lame and overrated .
low energy and tacky .
on my visit to coyote ugly last month with my fianc .
however _num_ dollar drafts were advertised and we were charged _num_ dollars .
even with no place to sit this bar is small .
none of the girls that worked there where dancing that much .
the only good thing about this place is the bar outside .
if i could i would give the bar outside _num_ stars i would have .
nothing like the movie so please do n't think that .
overall : it was lame .
me and my husband were there for _num_ minutes and then walked out .
save your money and go to hooters casino instead .
haha to this place cause it was a joke .
looking for a fun , cheap time .
go to coyote ugly !
drinks were reasonably priced , if you can get up to the bar .
this place is horrible .
you ca n't just have your patrons dance .
awful , rude service .
( we have a group of _num_ ) .
too bad .
without going into further detail , kevin is extremely unprofessional .
this place was kind of embarrassing .
it was so bad and not a happening place .
i ca n't believe people would pay to get in here .
not me .
no thanks !
what a waste of time !
oh hell no !
it is an absolute train wreck .
like many of the other reviews note , these girls are terrible .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this place is bullshit and i should have never fell for it .
do n't make the same mistake as my friends and i .
thank god i got in for free because this place was beyond lame .
there was a girl screaming into the mic the whole time .
so annoying .
the only cool thing was all the bras hanging from the ceiling .
mostly guys in here too being creepy and staring at the girls .
this is just not really my scene .
i 've been to this bar twice and not by first choice .
the place is small and can get very crowded .
it 's a bar ... like the movie coyote ugly .
the worst bar on earth .
they should pay you to tolerate this place instead of charging a ridiculous cover .
it is too crowded , and difficult to get to the bar .
wait in line , pay cover walk in the door .
she 's alright at it , nothing special .
free cover would n't be worth going to this bar .
we stopped here to grab a quick drink after visiting new york ny .
waste of money .
- did n't stay very long .
someone blows smoke in your face .
couple hot girls dancing on stage , a sausage fest watching them .
came here as part of a club crawl , did n't get it .
it did n't do much for me at all .
the girls were n't that great either .
bras on the roof , okay thats fine but thats it ?
the decor of this place was very poor .
it got boring after a while .
then , why even have a stage where you allow girls to go up ?
the rudeness here does not want to make me go back to this place .
drinks were not too bad .
shots were about $ _num_ and mixed drinks and beers were about $ _num_ .
bartender ladies most of them were pretty cool .
but i did see one of them yell at a customer .
i 'm not going to this place ever again .
`` , `` can you scream ?
there was no dancing on the bar tops .
without the `` coyote '' experience , it 's just another bar .
poor guy .
do n't come here for your birthday .
standing room only , seriously no stools or chairs .
hanging bras look gross .
avoid at all costs .
you 're better off at a regular hotel bar .
avoid at all costs !
no seating .
little or no fair comparison to the original in ny .
lame .
i did not order any drinks here , i just was not impressed .
i just think i will stay away from this place .
is not worth it .
i am just not a fan of any club atmosphere .
and this is just like that loud music and overpriced drinks .
but i am not into this kind of thing at all .
so not worth the money to get in .
would not recommend unless you 're looking for a cramped spot that is overpriced .
we asked him why , and he just said no .
and he still refused it .
total sausage fest .
so , i go into coyote ugly expecting the time of my life .
i want to dance on stage , and get cheap drinks .
as soon as i get in the bouncer eyes me and kicks me out .
who looks like someone they cant fuck but ca n't .
you 're better off spending your time and $ _num_ somewhere else .
drinks and jello shots were worth the money in vegas .
i was sober , and i am not exaggerating .
you wo n't stay long , trust me .
warning : do not give this place any business !
and look they only have _num_ 1/2 stars ... .
i was very disappointed with our experience here this time .
i am a las vegas local and have been to this bar several times .
i had _num_ friends in town for someone 's bachelorette weekend .
do not waste your time or money !
spend your money elsewhere .
avoid !
i wish i had looked at the yelp reviews before visiting this place .
too bad _num_ stars is n't an option .
what i enjoyed most about this place is the music .
do n't waste your money .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
can not believe they would n't give my husband a refund .
the worst .
the worst ever .
worst of vegas .
ps the worst .
if you have horrible taste in music , then this is for you .
do not accept drinks from strangers !
my daughter tried this the hard way last evening .
lame !
skip coyote ugly !
drinks were over-priced and standing room only .
get lil back and make it better .
worst bar i have ever been to !
awful , rude bouncer !
it 's not like it 's a lot of money .
it 's only $ _num_ '' with the rudest condescending attitude !
buy a drink or get the hell out !
in short this place .
is unprofessional and nothing like the movie .
do n't waste your money .
it was awful .
just stay away from the oysters !
the waiter was really embarrassed by all this .
we also ordered _num_ bottles of wine , and one of them was spoiled .
however , given all that went wrong i would certainly never go back again .
seating was quick once the table was ready for our reservation .
unless , of course , she was going to suggest something else .
i had a terrible piece of meat .
this was not the good stuff .
i had cut all the way through to the center and was still unhappy .
not the best , but nothing to complain about .
gallagher 's failed me on both accounts , though less on the former .
when we walked in , i already had a bad vibe from the hostess .
hubby ordered the dry aged sirloin steak with the side of mac and cheese .
the mac n cheese was a true disappointment ; it lacked season and flavor .
at this point , we had high hopes for this place .
confused , i called back , and they eventually found our name .
it was his birthday , this is what i was trying to avoid !
the dcor here has that feel of an upscale ny dinning establishment .
my friend also got clam chowder which he thought was ok .
looking forward i cut into my meat and the first bite , over cooked .
as i ate my meat , the cooking was so uneven .
the only place that was consistant was that the outside was well done .
my friends also had the same problems .
the total bill came out to be about $ _num_ including beers and tips .
this place is over rated .
the lamb was overcooked , essentially like cardboard .
thanks , i just spent ~ $ _num_ for _num_ star service .
worst steak house i have ever been to in vegas .
not going back .
i went here on a date and i regret it so bad .
its waaaay too casual for the prices they demand .
the lamb was cooked exactly as we requested .
the steaks on the other hand were all totally off the mark .
minutes later they came back to tell us they ran out of prime rib .
i mean it 's barely a quarter past 8pm .
also my server took my preference without skipping a beat .
what the hell does that mean ?
it tasted like wet beef .
this is a first also , i did not finish my steak .
it was simply that bad .
everyone else had similar opinions being average but nothing spectacular .
when it comes down to it the food was not even ok .
less than zero quality for service and food .
sunday evening sometime around 7pm .
fail !
fail !
yeah , i know it 's not a bakery .
no entrees .
their meat quality leaves much to be desired .
room acoustics are abysmal .
it was soft , well cooked , etc , no flavor .
noise level was way too loud .
sorry to do this but they earned this one star rating .
decor = _num_ stars based on my preference for contemporary spaces .
this is old school steakhouse style without any soul .
tourists of all ages wearing shorts and t shirts .
the bread was very stale .
the steak = _num_ star .
the filet was bland and tough .
wine = _num_ star for a terrible wine list .
avoid this place .
with so many options in vegas , you 'd be wasting your time here .
we ordered the _num_ cheese mac and cheese and broccoli au gratin .
the mac and cheese was pretty good but not outstanding .
the steaks were not good at all .
our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty .
the spinach was way too salty and disgusting .
this was a pricey adventure and one that wo n't be repeated .
the service was awful .
the food was good , but nothing special .
for the price , it should have been much better .
the staff gets _num_ stars .
the steak was n't the greatest .
but , that was n't cooked much less than the first one .
the lobster tail was a little over cooked .
if you know the difference , you 'll probably want to go elsewhere .
we spent in the neighborhood of $ _num_ for _num_ people .
now , we did n't eat the cheap stuff either .
_num_ of us had the surf & turf with the lobster tail .
the quality of the meal was the only problem .
yes , it was a big lobster tail , but it sucked .
the mac and cheese side dish was bland as hell .
- several dishes were cold when we finally got them ( i.e .
french fries , which are never good cold ) .
that 's disgusting !
overall , i was extremely disappointed .
this is unacceptable !
if i could give these guys no stars i would .
for the price we paid we should 've gone elsewhere .
horrible experience !
ate there before steak and lobster dinner special , but this time was awful .
never ever going back , and definitely would not recommend the place after this .
as far as price is concerned i do n't feel it was overly expensive .
gallagher 's was ok ... it was dry .
my husband was n't too impressed with the prime rib either .
do n't think we 'll be going there again .
service was horrible and slow .
extremely slow .
horrible .
the guy who refilled our waters provided better service !
the food was n't too great in my opinion .
it was also kind of dry .
the seasoning made them taste weird .
the bottom line : not recommended and the steaks need salt .
service was terrible .
someone else came and dropped off bread .
the meal started off with bread .
nothing special about it .
the steak was underwhelming to say the least .
the price really sets you up for disappointment .
again , pretty bland .
overall , the food was n't exactly terrible .
two stars for edible food , ordinary service , with an ok ambience .
unfortunately , it was all but great .
there is no reason that food at a steakhouse should come out cold .
our waiter never bothered to ask how we liked our food .
on the other hand gordon ramsey 's steak house at paris was unbelievable .
no no no .
avoid this place it 's just well located otherwise food sucks !
my ribeye was so chewy and i could not taste anything but black peppers .
there are better and cheap steaks available around strip .
disappointing for a $ _num_ plus steak .
either way we will probably stick to having steaks at home .
the atmosphere , service and drinks were good .
not as good as the one in ny .
the steaks were good , but the service was rough .
my wife , who is n't a steak fan , had the chicken .
not even close ... it was a mediocre experience at best .
steak snob alert !
my reaction however , was that - _num_ .
so , i order the dry aged new york which came out overcooked .
not only was the steak overcooked but it was dry .
my friend 's steak also came out overcooked .
what a disappointment .
started off with the worst old fashioned ever .
guess what guys , no soda in a properly made old fashion .
my ny strip was very tough !
thought my knife was dull , but it was not .
would not come back !
food is ok , very pricey and the hostess was snobby .
this is really about a new years eve experience , and lack of organization .
i could n't wait to try this place .
unfortunately , the service was horrible .
on top of that , my cut was overcooked , which is just wrong .
unfortunately that wo n't get me back to this place .
easily the worst steak house i 've been too .
while i love las vegas , i have been quite disappointed in the food .
my lobster was so rubbery i ate only half .
our bill came out to $ _num_ and that was with no alcohol .
i was so worried i was going to get ill after eating it .
$ _num_ wasted .
my filet cooked med rare was very tough and not flavored .
they were in shorts , flip flops and white t-shirts .
i 'd smack my momma for one .
now for the reason we wo n't go back .
terrible service and terrible drinks !
total waste of $ _num_ !
it was tough and dry and totally inedible .
my fianc and another woman at our table had the new york strip steak .
they struggled so hard to cut the steak that their fingers were sore .
it was _num_ % inedible , tons of fat and hardly any good meat .
he said it was our fault and that most of the steak was eaten .
this place was horrible !
in our group of seven she apparently checked out on three of the orders .
they accommodated our large bachelor party group - _num_ people .
the waitress did not accommodate requests , nor explained what was possible .
vegetarians beware - they could care less about you .
have n't left my room since , if you catch my drift .
prime rib : quite expensive for _num_ ?
it tasted so-so .
filet mignon - to me , it was just a meh steak .
i feel like you ca n't really messed up it too much .
i was pretty disappointed with the quality of steaks at this steakhouse .
my steak was entirely unimpressive other than being slightly larger than i expected .
not bad enough to send back , though .
my girlfriend 's cowboy ribeye was poorly prepared .
i tried a piece and was stuck chewing it for a good _num_ mins .
ultimately , i walked away very disappointed .
not recommended for steak .
but here 's why i give them _num_ stars .
on top of that my lobster tail was twice the price of my steak .
last but not least , me and the boyfriend became severely sick .
the worst stomach ache and diarrhea known to man .
we could n't point out if it was the lobster or the steak .
very bad experience and i do n't think we will ever visit again .
what a disappointment .
i had been wanting to try this place for years .
_num_ minutes later .
no talk about it no introduction .
which is weird because it says halibut on the board when you walk in .
boring .
bland .
disappointed .
overall fail from this place .
can i make this _num_ stars ?
in vegas on business , went with with _num_ other guys .
service and wine were good , steaks were mediocre .
not done even close to how ordered .
steak fries had strange taste .
not good .
the prime rib had zero flavor and was slightly under cooked .
if you want a great steak dinner , this is not the place !
the food was terrible .
very disappointing , if you know good beef , skip this place .
this is not prime beef .
the atmosphere and service only made the experience worse .
worst steak i ever had .
there are better meals to be had in vegas .
and i will not recommend this to anyone .
_num_ minutes after our reservation time was when we got steaks .
i could n't bring myself to give the third star .
slow service and underwhelming steaks left us fairly disappointed .
i would not recommend this steakhouse .
my dining partner also had a fatty , tough steak .
the sprouts were firm and very smokey .
the cauliflower was bland and missing seasoning .
the food was much better than the service .
it then took another _num_ mins to get our food .
our server was just bad .
the shrimp cocktail , brussel sprouts and steak fries were all good .
unfortunately , the shrimp for the appetizer was the star of this meal .
we both ordered the aged steak and it was ok , not great .
the blackened shrimp appetizer was exceptional but the steak was lacking .
service was very poor .
we were looking for a good steakhouse , came here based on reviews .
it was ok but definitely not worth the price .
wo n't be coming back or recommending .
this review is for my visit back in may _num_ .
i 'm just a little late is finishing my review .
our waiter was attentive without being annoying .
the food took an incredibly long time to come out .
there is no excuse for a tough filet .
it was chewy and did n't have much taste to it .
i was very disappointed .
i would have given this a _num_ star if i could .
stay away , one worst steak of my life for the money .
it tasted like i had made it at home myself .
had the aged ny strip - tasteless and tough .
not what was expected for the price and mediocre at best .
disappointed !
they raised their entre prices over _num_ % and threw in a baked potato .
two steaks , two glasses of wine , $ _num_ .
drinks bread and appetizers came out quick but steak took awhile .
nice ambiance but i 've had better steak .
we ate here for christmas dinner while staying at the new york new york .
i was very disappointed in the quality of the steak .
i had a better steak at dick 's last resort then i did here .
needles to say we did n't eat there again .
service - okay but nothing special .
way overpriced for average food .
your talking $ _num_ for the cheapest item for some over cooked salmon .
i would highly suggest buying your own steaks and cooking them !
this is not the case .
my friend ordered filet mignon , and there was no bone .
called back and spoke with the manager , no result .
our waiter was not attentive and seemed irritated .
but i came here and it was not a good experience .
will not be returning .
this place was a disappointment .
never again will i waste my time or my money on this establishment .
* the `` salsa '' trio - guacamole , queso , and sour cream .
oddly enough , no salsa ?
* chicken tortilla soup .
* combo - chili rellenos , chicken tamale , barbacoa burrito .
we really were n't impressed with the food here at all .
everything else was terrible .
the chicken tortilla soup was bland .
the entrees took far too long and were definitely not worth the wait .
the chile lime chicken fajitas tasted like store brought chicken strips .
it looked bad and tasted bad .
we do n't all want to watch the same commercials on every tv .
i said sure i guess , so he suggested the fajita burrito .
the rice lacked flavor and seemed stale , and the beans were horrid .
_num_ stars , but rounded down based on taste and value .
my steak salad had good steak , but sad salad .
the food was mediocre at best .
it was n't horrible , but there 's definitely better options to be had .
stayed at the ny ny hotel/casino - _num_ f outside .
and a jalepeno pepper baked on top .
chips for $ _num_ .
bean & cheese burrito was also small .
no bullshit .
$ _num_ for that .
the chips and salsa are endless .
then the rest of the basket was full of chip pieces .
service : slow .
tvs all showed the same lame golf channel .
$ _num_ for _num_ of us .
service- _num_ star .
it 's even cheaper at red rocks than here .
the ones we ordered were a huge pile with lots of toppings thrown around .
finally our server gave us one more refill .
it took _num_ minutes to get the check after we asked .
not good `` mexican '' food at all .
servers were friendly but food left much to be desired .
worst salsa ever .
carrots and peas in the `` spanish '' rice ... really ?
burrito was bland and not mexican !
sadly , it was downhill from there on in .
my experience was of very ordinary diner food served with little real care .
i hate that place . '
yikes ... .
pass .
i guess it just made me think we really were in nyc .
since we rarely get to eat good mexican food , i was totally down .
our waiter had a mad case of staring .
that is so wrong .
food is overpriced and just plain .
i can get a better steak salad at el pollo loco .
the chips were so salty i might as well eat salt chips .
i just think this restaurant is bad news .
there was flavor , but mostly of onion .
our meals both came with some cold , bland spanish rice and refried beans .
mediocre food , at most .
my friend got the enchiladas , which she said were nothing short of mediocre .
the only good thing about this place were the chips and salsa .
they did not bring out the right food for my friend .
i 'm giving it _num_ stars only because it was ok & not disgusting .
do n't eat here !
bleh ... seriously that 's all i want to say but i wo n't .
food was terrible .
drinks were pretty yummy and i thought this could be dangerous !
super annoying and the dj sucked .
it does n't need to be that loud unless your in an actual club .
probably wo n't be back .
only gets one star because of the chips & salsa and the margaritas .
not sure how the food is here .
as for the sides , you get your standard rice and beans .
this food is not good .
overall experience was not good .
the guacamole had too much lime .
they charge u for everything including salsa and for chips also .
the waiter we had was not friendly .
the tortilla soup was bland and served cold .
the food was lukewarm when it arrived .
fish tacos were not tasty at all .
the wife and i were trying to find good mexican food in vegas .
was bland and lack spice .
all of it was way over cooked .
rice was mush , yuck !
had little if no alcohol .
big chunks of ice in the bottom .
was also spilled all down the side of the glass .
the salsa and chips are not to be missed if you go !
you can make your own decision but , i wo n't be back .
if and when you are also disappointed try la salsa .
the cheese inside was not completely melted .
i would also avoid the margaritas at this place .
they are very costly , and there is very little alcohol in them .
you 're better off buying a dollar margarita in one of the casinos .
if i ever return i would go elsewhere .
the service was not good at all .
probably wo n't be back again .
a very large restaurant in the new york new york casino .
we chose the outdoor seating so we could people watch while we ate .
the margarita was too sweet and a little watered down .
that was a bit of a disappointment .
for dinner , i had a beef burrito .
it was very very difficult to communicate with the waitress .
i ordered nachos , which was only _num_ chips - $ _num_ .
fajitas were better , but strip priced too .
service was poor .
_num_ stars only because the meat was tender .
no salsa on nachos ?
beans , meat and cheese .
ugh .
the service also seemed impersonal .
there was no food counter , but should have been .
although slightly better than taco bell , there was nothing special about this place .
service was slow and unhelpful as well .
does n't matter , because i ai n't coming back .
the main salsa was okay but nothing to write home about .
i ordered the chicken & shrimp fajitas and they were nothing special .
sub par mexican at strip prices !
anyone who says this is great needs their head examined .
their cadillac margarita was completely watered down .
i 'm not convinced there was any tequila in it .
plus , the service was nonexistent .
the only good part of the meal was the hostess .
would not go back .
i ate carnitas here at two o'clock .
by five o'clock i was flat on my back .
eating here basically ruined the last day and a half of our vacation .
i do not recommend eating here .
drinks used to be a lot better .
would have put zero stars but it wo n't let me !
plus they were so rude about it !
i 'll never come back after this and am so disappointed !
not much more to be said .
the enchiladas were a wet mess of shredded chicken and zero flavor .
the salsa was equally bad .
i could n't complain , as our waiter never returned to ask .
this has to be one of the worst mexican restaurants i 've been to .
first off , who pays for chips and salsa ?
for the quality of the food the whole menu is horribly overpriced .
it literally took less than _num_ minutes for the food to come out .
i ordered their burrito and it was disgusting .
the queso taste nothing like cheese .
tastes like straight sweet and sour .
they should not be open .
i ate the chicken and steak fajitas .
do n't waste your slots money here !
very mediocre and pricey ( just like vegas !
the pepper itself was not cooked properly and was basically in raw form .
i enjoy some crunch to my veggies but this was not cooked long enough .
very disappointed .
honestly one of the worst mexican food i have ever tasted .
i wish i had tried any other restaurants near by !
one table at our group never got served for almost a full hour .
got their drinks , orders were taken just no food .
one of the worst margaritas i could n't finish .
i 'm not sure how this could really have _num_ stars .
it was a mediocre experience .
the pork for my salad , thankfully , was served on the side .
we were not offered refills on our drinks .
service is not good , i had diarrhea after eating chicken fajita burrito today .
the border grill at mandalay bay is way better .
should not have to get sick in vegas after eating at expensive restaurant .
the inside of the restaurant is clean and not super noisy .
service is never an issue , the food could just be better .
unfortunately , regarding the tamales , the menu was accurate .
and it was not a wow !
i wo n't be heading back .
waited for _num_ minutes was not served despite several attempts .
restaurant was fairly empty .
save yourself some time and head elsewhere .
this was our default restaurant every time we visit vegas until last time .
our waiter appeared _num_ minutes after being seated .
this guy ruined a perfect evening with my daughter .
horrible , horrible food !
my boyfriend and i were in the mood for mexican and saw this place .
bad choice .
i ordered the carne asada tacos while my boyfriend ordered the chicken tikka enchiladas .
my taco shells were so soggy that i had a hard eating them .
the meat had good flavor but was too dry .
this is a large tourist trap , i mean souvenir shop .
this place is a rip-off .
do n't bother coming here .
i know they are on the strip selling junk to tourists but seriously folks .
most of the stuff is tacky and low quality .
absolutely the worst experience in chanel i 've ever had .
the brand itself is hands down _num_ starts , but this boutique ?
one was polite and said hello , but then got a phone call .
i was so utterly disgusted with my experience at this chanel boutique .
i will never give that store my business after that experience .
i left very angry .
shows the character of the girl in charge of make-up at chanel at wynn .
she was not friendly .
granted , i was only carrying my coach clutch and was dressed very casual .
regardless , i was very turned off and walked away .
fyi , that chanel wallet is n't worth $ _num_ .
if i could give them a zero , i would .
sales people were rude and did n't even try to help me .
what horrible stuck up sales people .
not one associate greeted me .
this store had every associate acting like they had someplace better to go .
she 's very unfriendly , uninterested and unhappy .
no clothes here yet , no need to go in !
just home and furniture , waste of what it could be !
this one freaking sucks .
the person that rang me up said about _num_ minutes .
my husband was _num_ minutes late to an appointment with the nurse .
i was _num_ minutes late for my appointment for my daughter .
ridiculous .
this office is based on volume not quality of care .
someone ca n't be a good doctor if he refuses to see a patient .
refused !
absolutely no wifi service in the room .
so travelers , whatever ever happen in vegas , stay in hotel lobby .
the wifi is very slow and frustrating .
this was the worst feature .
the pool is not heated .
overall , _num_ star customer service in a two star hotel .
first of all , i 'm not a big fan of marriott .
they really need to step up their game when compared to hilton .
it 's extremely hard ( or firm if you prefer ) .
i was able to sleep on it but it was much too hard .
the carpets are old and it just feels a bit run down .
after check-in it just seemed to go downhill .
being in vegas in the summer , that 's a huge negative .
the other room they gave our group had the same problem !
the beds were not that comfortable , decent at best .
not very friendly at all .
when we stayed here we did n't feel welcome at all .
we were also unfortunate to stay here during the sketchy remodel .
do n't stay here , it was n't a pleasant experience at all .
not your normal marriott by any means .
the rooms were ok , but the tv did n't work well .
many of the channels were fuzzy .
probably the worst hotel i 've stayed in when you factor in the price .
just an awful stay all around .
this is ridiculous i do n't know who manages here but they have problems .
all night long the security did n't see the broken glass ?
do not stay here .
they have no hot water .
they had this issue _num_ years ago when i stayed here .
staff is n't that friendly either .
review for the cheap long term airport parking .
parked here in july _num_ when some construction was going on .
i reviewed the parking on their parking website and it was never posted .
my very first visit was scheduled incorrectly .
i kept my kids ' cleanings scheduled last week & everything went well .
this was most probably the worst dining experience that i have ever had .
the food itself was mediocre and expensive .
terrible service .
the guy was very mean .
i 'm glad i am just a tourist .
but do n't go here .
horrible service and way too expensive .
food was whatever and service was horrible .
he did not even replace it or discount it at all .
he made it seem like i cooked it and served it to myself .
i will not go back because it was not worth the money at all .
but do not go there to eat in .
service is very slow and poor .
the food was shockingly bad .
the food was not good and very expensive .
the french fries were fried in old oil , the shawarma was very average .
avoid , avoid , avoid .
but surely they would be ready today .
the store is heavily advertised , but not open .
not even close .
i could 've worn them for my holiday parties !
it 's mid april and i 'm still waiting for my last pair .
i was treated so rudely that i will never come back .
i do n't care if i have to pay a higher exchange rate .
i was disappointed with this restaurant .
the creamed spinach was too creamy and somewhat bland .
my experiences since that first visit have n't been good .
i have found the steaks to be way too salty and buttery .
in addition , they are a little dry for my taste .
everything else ( from salads , sides , desserts ) are mediocre at best .
your money is better spent at houston 's , morton 's or lawry 's .
ruined our valentine plans .
walked out ... .
ambiance was not good .
lots better in las vegas .
onion soup was good , ny strip good , filet was just ok .
the whole place just lackluster .
very disappointing .
unfortunately , what sent us there was a $ _num_ gift certificate .
that is where any positives end .
ordered escargot and a huge disappointment .
both salads were so not memorable that i ca n't remember what they were .
he did not however explain the cost of the complementary oscar addition .
i find that absurd .
i will spare you the ugly details .
food was undercooked and displayed very sloppy .
bread sent out was stale ... .
miserable heat !
when you walked back inside , it felt like opening an oven door .
this was just unacceptable .
it would have been a better experience .
oh and do n't tell me you had no idea !
garbage , no wonder this place closed .
rip ruth chris in vegas !
why do they have this restaurant at the mirage ?
i ate here for breakfast with my fiancee , and we highly regret it .
we both ordered the complete breakfasts and it tasted horrible .
do n't get me started on the prices .
it cost $ _num_ for a glass of orange juice !
horrible ... just plain horrible .
by all means , do not eat here .
the service is slow and the waiters are very , very rude .
this is unacceptable , especially at the mirage .
i think this may be the worst hotel cafe in vegas .
horrible .
the ahi poke was ok , nothing like roy 's .
the sandwhich was better , but not superb .
a bit disappointed .
however the service here really really sucked big time .
no wonder this damn place was empty .
food alone , the place is probably _num_ stars .
the one miss was my boyfriend 's pork roast .
our bill was about $ _num_ for the two of us .
_num_ apps , _num_ entrees , _num_ desserts , no alcohol .
yikes - this place is horrid .
what we found it offered was cafeteria quality italian food with crappy service .
this place totally sucks .
we were utterly disappointed .
first of all , the service was slow and terrible .
the mirage should be embarrassed to even have this place in the hotel .
i could barely stomach it .
the dessert was n't much better .
we left feeling like we 'd been robbed .
it was served with a pink sauce .
for my entree i had the shrimp scampi linguine .
you could tell that the pasta was n't cooked fresh .
very annoying .
clearly the hostess gave our table to the line jumper without a reservation .
very annoying .
very annoying !
i would deter anyone reading this from going .
i paid a total of $ _num_ for _num_ people .
do not go to this restaurant .
it is the biggest rip off in vegas .
i 'm so disappointed with mirage .
this place is the worst !
no way , it had no flavor !
my chicken parm was okay .
very disappointing .
they also were generous and included one pepperoni in my salad .
it made the exterior of fish taste very dry .
overpriced , very mediocre italian .
given the choices in town i would avoid this place .
my pasta dish was very gummy with a ragu type sauce and raw carrots !
the service was also dreadful .
we paid a platinum price for garbage !
skip this place !
only one star only because i could n't give it less .
located in the mirage , this overpriced italian restaurant was a disappointment for all !
the spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste .
the gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all .
there are better places to spend your time and money .
white linen covered tables fill the rest of the room .
this food was very disappointing .
there was a lack of flavor in the food .
i just assume that is how the food tastes and i do not return .
however , our server although nice , was speaking from a script .
not a good idea if you 're trying to make diners feel special .
i had veal osso bucco , absolutely horrible .
i will not be coming back here .
bread basket finally arrives , but so disappointing .
cold & dry .
we barely had half a piece and pushed it to the side .
_num_ mins later we started on our appetizers .
calamari was average , octopus was decent .
my friends chicken parm was a disaster .
thick chunks of cold chicken in tomato sauce !
me & my friend had already finished our courses .
we went off the good reviews , unfortunately .
bread basket finally arrives , but so disappointing .
cold & dry .

_num_ mins later we started on our appetizers .
calamari was average , octopus was decent .
my friends chicken parm was a disaster .
thick chunks of cold chicken in tomato sauce !
me & my friend had already finished our courses .
horrible !
their signature dish `` chicken parm '' tasted like it was frozen and reheated .
the sauce was disgusting .
this is small portions of average food at fine dining prices .
dining here was an educational experience .
the sides were mediocre , the sauteed mushrooms were too salty .
save your money for the tables .
the situation made my experience that much more horrible .
my friend had the roasted chicken with herb vegetables .
he attended and listened but after the dishes came out he somewhat disappeared .
the mandarin pieces on the side were yummy .
the lobster tail was overcooked !
it was a $ _num_ entre so i was expecting to be wowed .
i was not wowed at all .
service : i believe half of the restaurant was staffed by one waitress .
the service was poor and impersonal .
i will not dine here again .
i have to give it low reviews because the service just absolutely sucks .
we could n't get refills on our sodas at all .
i still tipped _num_ % , but was n't happy about it , ha .
our bill was $ _num_ and we did n't get dessert .
let me just first say this place is pricey .
the waiter was slow and really did n't give us much attention .
the food coming out was incredibly slow and took forever .
i also had a baked potato with everything .
i 've had better baked potatoes everywhere .
i will not be returning .
the only reason i gave it _num_ stars was because the steak was good .
it was $ _num_ .
the show was at 9:30 , so we made a 7:30 appt .
the service on the other hand was not so much .
to me , it seemed very inefficient .
we waited another _num_ min before i food even arrived .
no dessert ? ''
check was brought over ... but he never came back to run the card !
we never did see our server again for the rest of the evening .
there was not a manager in sight .
the rude service almost ruined our entire night !
it 's not vibrant , but a tired restaurant .
by tired i do n't mean the service was weak .
now by tired i do n't mean lame .
it 's just old school food with old school enthusiasm .
the menu prices were top dollar , the food was n't .
the menu would change a little , the quality would shoot through the roof .
to end on a positive note , they recently added a vegetarian plate .
this consistent meh response will kill any restaurant .
and , yes , houston 's has a veggie plate to die for .
not to mention a homemade veggie burger which kills .
this place sucks .
the price point is ridiculous for the under quality of the food .
what a sad disappointment .
the restaurant is very near to to the check-in desk .
it was loud .
at first , it seemed helpful , but it really was laughable .
total bill was $ _num_ for four people .
crazy expensive for ok food , bad location , and horrid service .
would be a zero if possible .
unfortunately , we got the rudest waitress that has ever walked the planet .
we had a horrible experience .
the lobster bisque was nothing but cream , no lobster for $ _num_ !
we had the broccoli and cauliflower au gratin as a side , disgusting .
completely over priced and the food was bad .
one of the worst dining experiences my family and i have ever had .
the lead server was rude and in attentive .
the food was way over priced and poor quality .
prime rib - flavorless .
french onion soup - flavorless .
save your money , go to stack , or the buffet at cravings .
the bread they brought out was cold , and not fresh .
then came back to tell me , they were out of that anyways .
the lobster bisque portion and crab cake portions were very small .
the crab cakes were ok .
i sent the steak back , the manager came over and apologized .
but we were in a hurry because of the show .
was i supposed to bake this at home later ?
i was embarrassed for them .
after adding some salt it was better but not a great preparation .
i will not come back .
above average strippers , _num_ out of _num_ will be _num_ 's or better .
hell no .
went there on a friday night and this place was a disaster .
there were only a handful of girls there and really only two attractive ones .
that being said , i parked my butt at the tip rail .
and by vip , i mean too chunky to be on stage .
so she gave me an `` air '' dance .
this is literally the worst strip club i have ever been to !
i paid $ _num_ to sit down and have a diet coke .
given how empty it was when we visited , i expected better service .
there were no apologies , just statement .
the waiter dude here had no idea what was goin on .
it really is a sampling of faux regional type chinese like dishes .
went here for lunch with _num_ colleagues .
both times the dishes came out very bland .
first night the waitress had no social skills .
second night the waitress was much better .
this was probably the worst pf changs i have been to in any regard .
and then it showed up .
expensive and overcooked ... place was empty and cooking time was quite long .
terrible experience .
no way will i go back .
calamari : was lukewarm and tasted like fish sticks .
rice : was dry and al dente ... at an asian restaurant .
the green onions were offensive , inedible and awkward .
ginger ale : watered down .
i 'm very disappointed about our visit .
the food was very very slow .
i 'm extremely unhappy and we will never come back to this location .
also ... worse yet , the food was incorrect !
not spicy at all .
totally different than other restaurants ... waste of money .
very poor experience .
poor service from the management and incorrect food .
this won failed at all three .
the waiter must have been trained at mcdonalds .
bad experience .
very poor management at a great chain .
waited in line to see how long a wait would be for three people .
double thumbs down .
my cousin 's wine order , _num_ minutes .
service is terrible !
came in tonight , was seated right away .
ordered an appetizer that took almost _num_ min to come .
so disappointed !
rice tasted like plastic .
service sucked .
walked in before noon time today by myself , the place was empty .
worst place to sit in the house !
so i ordered a tropical green tea , not bad .
my vibe was going down south from that point .
i was n't impressed with the meal , it was a cold creamy dish .
the white rice was dried , tasted like overnight rice .
very annoying !
she mentioned she would let my server know .
no special dessert ever came .
i was unhappy with the service .
horrible from start to finish .
the chicken was dry the quality of the food has definitely gone down .
the rice was mediocre at best .
so we payed our tab and left .
i was so disappointed : ( never coming back to this location .
_num_ dollars gone and a bad taste in my mouth .
however , no server came by for about _num_ minutes .
the pork dumplings were greasy and tough .
not a hint of ginger in the sauce .
dan dan noodles were okay .
as many others have mentioned , the food never disappoints .
hostesses are absolutely horrible .
wait staff are friendly , but disorganized and slow .
there 's no sense of urgency .
wait staff are really slow and disorganized .
this is not sichuan dan dan noodle .
their lunch portion is very , very small for it 's price .
service is very slow and it was a slow lunch day .
service was horrible .
when we arrived , there were maybe _num_ tables occupied .
_num_ bartenders , and _num_ servers .

the table we sat in was not ideal .
there were no other tables available for a party of _num_ .
shame on you .
service is slow .
hot and sour soup is average .
disappointing given pf chang 's reputation .
garbage .
ca n't complain .
the lettuce wraps were so small u could not `` wrap the chicken '' .
tried to alert the server but she was no where in sight .
i did n't get the `` good customer service '' feel !
sad cuz i really was looking forward to it !
no comfortable place to wait .
so not chinese food .
i 've never in my life sent food back !
the lettuce wraps were bad too .
how can those be bad !
too bad it was n't better in overall quality .
typical chinese chain restaurant food .
flavors are not particularly memorable .
i just remember alot of salty dishes .
one thing i do enjoy is the chicken lettuce wraps .
too much oil , sauce .
not fresh tasting as when they opened .
was n't really happy with my experience here .
the bar top where i sat was sticky and gross .
i ordered the lettuce wraps and the filling lacked texture and was mushy .
do n't have any desire to go back .
our waiter took back our plates only to bring us more dirty ones .
really gross .
it literally was almost an hour wait to check in to the hotel !
i highly recommend getting a bargain hotel elsewhere .
it is not worth the savings .
this was by far the worse stay in vegas i have ever had .
after that when we finally get to the room it smelled like shit .
my gf could n't even breath in .
it smelled just as bad .
so that was the biggest upgrade .
it was late we could not find another room so we just stayed .
the whole stay was just so annoying .
but it did not stop there .
forget the price its not worth it .
worse place ever !
if i can give this place a _num_ i would !
when we get to the other room things were fine .
strike _num_ ... .
strike _num_ ... your out !
i 've stayed here twice and had `` meh '' experiences both times .
last year were were in _num_ and this year was _num_ .
they like $ _num_ .
if you know how to use yelp , you can also use google maps .
check in is very late ( at _num_ ) but we did n't care .
our room had _num_ double beds .
all together , it was $ _num_ for a saturday night .
the beds were about _num_ inches apart .
the lock on the bathroom door did n't work .
neither were problems for us .
there was never any information telling us that we needed to supply this .
our room was crowded with old , worn wooden furniture .
not very ideal when flying in .
the customer service sucks times _num_ .
unable to cancel or they 'll keep my first night pay .
she was very rude and unprofessional .
however the customer service was absolutely horrid .
are you kidding me ?
why did n't i check yelp ?
terrible service .
poor security .
how ridiculous to make a simple task look so difficult .
the room was absolutely disgusting .
the bath tub was filthy .
probably should n't sleep on them unless you want a disease .
the room was horrendous , even my dog hated it .
we tried speaking with the manager , which was a waste of time .
unless you really do n't care about decent quality .
first off , i would like to say the hotel is very nice .
i was told there is an _num_ dollar charge for the early arrival .
on my last night , i talked to a man at the front desk .
two weeks after my stay , i was charged _num_ dollars .
i waited a week , never receiving a picture .
i called again , she said she would send them `` today . ''
after _num_ weeks , _num_ calls , and _num_ emails , they finally responded .
after that it 's all bad !
room has a nasty smell as soon as you open the door .
above all ac in vegas has to work it 's too damn hot .
it comes on but never gets to even a comfortable temp .
spend an extra _num_ a night and avoid this place .
$ _num_ for towels ?
i gave the one star because the room is clean .
i complained but no response was given .
we will not stay here ever again .
check in at _num_ pm ?
no fitted sheet on the bed and a dirty dirty dirty bed skirt .
should have left at three strikes unfortunately it continues .
the hotel was empty when i checked in on thursday .
what 's the point of a gate with no lock ?
i suggest you do n't stay here.
this place sucks do n't let the name trick you .
it was horrible ... .
do n't expect much ... this is a low end hotel .
everything in room was clean albeit very old .
the room was small , which was fine until we saw the bedroom .
lastly , i do not think the floors were vacuumed .
awful costumer service !
the attitude of each staff member we spoke with was awful !
there was always a long line of complaining customers at the front desk .
too expensive for a shitty hotel .
wifi did n't work - we were in room # _num_ .
it 's a disgusting motel .
i do not recommend this place.
do n't stay here .
it 's not really on the strip .
the taxi cabs in vegas are a joke .
same menu as every location , same food sadly .
too greasy and bland for my tastes !
are you effing kidding me ?
they are bad news !
in conclusion , i had to pay for the _num_ days car rentals .
wo n't be coming here ever again .
_num_ days past still no call .
another week passes by and of course , no call or update .
a phone call is not that hard .
when i showed mac the chip he tried to brush it off .
never coming back and will tell my other friends to stop coming here .
incredibly disappointed .
i get another bill for about $ _num_ .
just like most auto body places .
these guys are dishonest people .
i chose to ignore all those negative reviews and gave them a try .
_num_ days later , when i went to pick up my car .
the hood will not line up .
they even lost my hood support .
no apology or even acknowledgement was given .
the owner suddenly became defensive about the mickey mouse job that they had done .
it is that bad of a car to begin with .
it was a nightmare and i was out of $ _num_ .
lol such was the case last week in vegas .
if i ever stop here again i 'll ask for hotter salsa .
las vegas , why you no have good taco shops ?
when we arrived , we were completely ignored by one of the salespeople .
i asked how much the charge would be and she said $ _num_ !
i 'm not paying that for a simple hem .
he said the charge is supposed to be $ _num_ .
i 've experienced better ' _num_ star rating .
second try : plain .
fourth try : chocolate glazed and my second negative experience .
umm ... do n't know what the deal with this place is .
this time i chose an old fashioned doughnut with no glaze .
it was _num_ am so i assumed they were doughnuts from yesterday .
nonetheless i 'm not coming back .
disappointing .
this place smells like sewage ... coffee machine was a gas station cappuccino machine .
no thanks .
i walked in with a headache , which usually means i need to eat .
not so .
i walked in and was seated , ordered a coke .
_num_ minutes went by without a sign of my soup or the coke .
eventually meat made its way over on skewers ... slowly .
there was only one server handling the small selection of meats .
the meat was disgusting .
i could not finish what was on my plate because it was just horrible .
all the meats were dry and some tasted old .
as always i should have listened to you yelpers .
( not to mention _num_ stars ) .
this is because it is the most expensive thing on the menu .
disgusting .
i ordered the greek salad because i was scared to get anything else .
everyone thinks he 's an idiot , even his employees !
the place was upstairs and out of view .
this was ok , but nothing special .
i have not been to other options in town ( i.e .
would recommend trying other options .
no impressed , very old , dingy places .
food was very dry .
meat selection very limited , price very high .
decor needs a major update .
dirty and dingy smelling bathrooms .
next disappointment was the slow service .
why could he have not helped out is beyond me .
there was only one other table in the restaurant .
i was really disappointed with the quality of food .
bad idea !
the whole experience was a nightmare .
avoid this dump at all costs .
that 's good , right ?
so we wandered over here .
i did n't see the bill ( thanks dan ! )
step up the game , update restaurant , the carpet is from old vegas !
it was terrible .
i received a coupon from united blood service $ _num_ value for _num_ .
with _num_ sodas , our total bill was $ _num_ , without tip .
a waste of money considering i left hungry .
the restaurant looks old , a little dirty , but smells delicious .
the rice was very , very bad .
the chicken and turkey were good .
all the other meat were bland .
quite disappointed , but at least i know .
i am not sure what all these good reviews are for .
horrible fucking service and not so great food .
as soon as we walked in , we were seated right away .
after that , it all went downhill .
_num_ minutes pass by and finally the waiter comes to bring us water .
so that 's _num_ min to get some fucking water .
it tasted really fishy .
next , the salad comes out and the dressing tasted so nasty .
not one of us ate the salad .
the only thing that i can say was good was the chicken .
i will never go back to this bullshit ass restaurant .
i walked out , and so did two other couples in my area .
one star is too good for this place .
it was horrible .
none and i mean none have ever been as horrible as this place .
this place has gone extremely down hill since the last time we were there !
the sides to the main dinner were also horrible !
the salad dressing tasted like pure vinegar , i could n't eat it .
my only regret was we did n't leave with them .
an awful experience to say the least !
then only a few of us received our drinks .
this is one of the worst restaurants i have been .
old , old , old ... ... .
bad cheap food ... .
so far the place looks old and smells old .
we could not eat it .
as they were cutting it , it looked grey , the taste was bad !
buy one get one is a waste of your money .
nice people but they are not serving fresh food .
no way to give no stars .
i was served raw chicken .
no one came to apologize by the time i left .
the good is ok and the service is horrible .
when we ask them question they just walk away .
i will never come back and do not recommended this place for anyone .
wish i could put _num_ stars .
it took _num_ minutes to get just water .
right on our heels were two other groups that got pissed off as well .
avoid this place if you can !
if it was possible to give this experience _num_ stars , i would .
the vegetarian meal was steamed vegetables .
tasteless steamed vegetables .
i had to add salt to make it mediocre .
it was not worth the price .
our total bill for _num_ people was $ _num_ before tip .
$ _num_ of that was _num_ doubled shots .
why would the waiter double the shots without asking , especially at that price ?
when we went there an old lady was being are rude to us .
every meat i tried here it tasted worse than trash !
we left there feeling sick and i 'm never going there ever again .
service was horrible !
sat there for _num_ hours .
paid $ _num_ per person and had barely any food !
the staff was entirely confused .
once the food came my shrimp scampi tasted like nursing home food .
the veggies were flavorless as well as the side of rice .
the shrimp were small and drenched in a generic cream sauce .
very sour !
if less salt i think it would of been better .
worst place ever !
took more than _num_ mins just for a glass of water .
do n't make the mistake get pizza you will be better off .
bad bad bad service ... .
walking away very unhappy !
showed up , they looked closed .
i guess that 's where we went wrong .
went pretty slow , took over hour and a half .
the second floor hallway stinks .
the place is under much needed renovation .
our bathroom was really dirty - especially in the shower .
the room was not made up .
had the worst time here .
for one the whole place smelled like smoke .
the lady at the front desk was not friendly .
the only redeeming quality is the distance from the strip .
first off there is no continental breakfast as it had back in the day .
i had to wait _num_ minutes past their check out time .
the is barely any water pressure .
there internet connection is for crap !
after having our room cleaned we were not left new clean towels .
she was like yep , i 'll write that up .
i 'm shocked this is a aaa listed location .
worst service i have ever recieved !
you ca n't breathe when you walk down the halls .
the internet connection is included , but very poor .
it is not easy to keep a constant temperature in the shower .
this was the only reason why i stayed at this super _num_ .
that late at night and no reservations , one ca n't be picky .
sorry , but this calls for one star .
i stayed here _num_ weekends ago .
a few really helpful people and some who could care less .
this is was one of the worst motel experiences i had .
the hotel smell and run down .
i know it 's motel but in vegas , they should do better .
fuck this place .
never use their parking only function .
noise in hallway is loud and bed is uncomfortable and pillows very thin .
a/c worked well and tv had a lot of channels to choose from .
but no such room existed .
the only good side was the price for i got when i reserved it .
the room was a two bed and sofa .
this is more like the section _num_ motel .
they did n't check us in until almost an hour past check in time .
i made online reservations through a travel site .
they asked me what type of room i requested .
i told them non-smoking , _num_ queen beds .
let them know that is not what i requested .
rude and inconsiderate staff , i will definitely never stay here again .
i would give this place negative _num_ stars if i could .
my friend selected non smoking room and _num_ beds .
tina at the front desk was fake nice .
not even a whole night .
this place does not deserve any business .
we stayed _num_ days .
house keeping did n't make up our room .
nothing but oatmeal packets .
cold cereal , bread , plastic packaged pastry and extremely small styrofoam coffee cups .
next time we 'll stay elsewhere .
this hotel is awful .
there are homeless people outside digging in garbage can .
they were very rude to me .
i was not pleased at all with their customer service skills .
rooms in this establishment really drive that point home .
i recommend that no one says at this hotel .
had an incident with someone coming in our room @ _num_ in the morning .
staff gave person wrong key .
staff did n't nothing about it .
would definitely not stay here again .
the worst experience ever .
the bathroom was very dirty , water is not running through in the toilet !
do not stay in this place .
the `` continental breakfast '' was pitiful .
i wo n't be going back to the super _num_ .
that said , they were remodeling and it smelled like fresh paint .
not so clean !
the worst service i 've ever seen .
no excuse , no discount , no good management service .
the worst wifi connection .
do n't pity the extra money and book another place .
the worst places i ever stayed !
the bed was hard and uncomfortable .
i called reception twice and no one answered the phone .
they charged me taxes twice and they could n't even explain why .
overall , awful place to be .
sometimes cheap = disgusting .
too .
i was embarrassed that i actually booked this .
too .
i was embarrassed that i actually booked this .
check out in morning ridiculous .
lots of clients trying to get to airport and one clerk working .
ca n't get smell out of my thoughts .
so this place is pretty cheap and close to the strip but ... .
i checked in around _num_ and notified them immediately .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
first off , the room is absolutely disgusting .
half of the outlets did not work .
we stayed here for _num_ days and our room did not get cleaned once !
$ _num_ for _num_ nights staying in a filthy hotel , no thanks .
i do not even know how this place is open , absolutely no standards .
i gave this motel _num_ stars because it was n't completely disgusting .
for example , i did n't find any live bugs .
but i did find was a room in which the air conditioning work great !
the shower walls were old and it looked like the paint was peeling everywhere .
there were a couple of positives .
no eggs or potatoes or breakfast meat .
and again , the air conditioning blow very cool .
the only problem that it was very noisy .
i 'm tired .
once for _num_ , to my boyfriend who was going to meet me .
one actually left and cancelled to go sleep at the airport !
and _num_ to me , for two weekend nights .
a total rip off .
do n't stay here .
the air conditioner was noisy .
almost all of the employees were rude and didnt care about the customer .
no eggs .
no muffins .
no fruit .
you could find your room number again .
there was a lot of noisy ghetto people yelling down the halls .
the room looked old and dirty .
wish there was a minus scale , stayed at this hotel over .
the room was dirty and stunk , there were dead bugs on the floor .
the bedding was not changed once and we were there for _num_ days .
the had either apples or oranges and a pastry a cheap cinnamon roll .
the breakfast could have been way better considering what we paid for this room .
i am really unsatisfied with this hotel and will never ever stay here again .
what a terrible choice we made going with this one .
then another _num_ minutes or so for all the other entrees to come out .
my steamed clams were super salty .
the hubby ordered a mediterranean salad with grilled salmon .
what he got was a caesar salad with grilled chicken .
my friend 's shrimp scampi were so overcooked they were like rubber .
they just threw the cocktail shrimp on a warm plate making them very unappetizing .
if i could give this place a negative star rating i would .
this is by far the worst restaurant i have ever attended .
first off , the wait was terrible .
the waiter never came around to apologize nor explain the long wait .
our water was never refilled .
that was the next disaster .
the chicken of my friend 's chicken pasta came out overcooked and black .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
no apologies again .
why the hell did i eat here ?
the fellow yelpers are correct : the service is very , very slow .
what i do n't get is receiving the appetizers along with the entrees .
i still did not understand the concept on why we were there too long .
skip it by all means .
but the menu .
it was plain pasta and sauce for $ _num_ and a small portion .
my other friends commented that their meals were just ok .
just avoid this as i will do my next trip .
worst .
moldy food ( rolls should never be green .
i wish i had read other people 's review before i went there .
the service was horrible .
we waited _num_ min and did n't see our food .
why did it take _num_ min ?
this review is long overdue .
it was our first night in town and the worst dinner ever .
i was rather disappointed with this place .
me and my partner went for dinner the week before christmas .
this was the worst meal we had .
there were no service problems .
he says they were among the worst he 's had .
oysters are far better if they are really cold .
it was piping hot , if somewhat bland .
large chunks of calamari , in a very light and tasteless batter .
bland .
the side vegetables were overcooked and bland .
dinner for two ( no drinks ) was around $ _num_ .
far too much for substandard seafood .
but this is vegas , with literally unlimited dining choices .
i regret that choice .
as we walked in the staff were very welcoming .
however , out waiter was extremely rude and condescending .
it tasted like creamy tomato basil .
i recommend trying another restaurant in this mall !
satisfied ... yes , but overall , what a waste of a time .
our worst meal of the weekend .
horrible !
the breakfast sucked .
my blueberry pancakes were n't even real pancakes .
worst over priced $ _num_ crap pancakes i 've ever had !
oysters was not fresh , had a fishy taste .
nobody else there deserves a star .
one food runner ruined the name of oyster bay and all of their employees .
avoid at all costs .
horrible service and horrible food .
not good , not horrible , does the job for breakfast .
ordered eggs benedict , and was n't that best .
felt like it was an amateur cook making the eggs benedict .
however we were starving so gave it a shot .
complimentary bread was completely stale .
calamari from the frozen foods section of walmart .
my friend 's crab legs were old and gross .
if that food was free at a party i would n't eat it again .
disappointment .
upside it was fresh , no funky smell and we didnt get sick .
( drink refills , bill , ) it seemed a little chaotic .
seated quickly then completely ignored !
service matters and this place is sure to disappoint .
food was just ok and service poor .
i also added a side of _num_ sausage links .
all _num_ pieces of the french toast was burned .
not acceptable .
my wife 's omelette was pretty petite and had too much cheese .
service was slow .
first impressions last a lifetime so i will never be back .
you should n't go away hungry from a _num_ dollar italian entree .
prices are average .
$ _num_ for a bowl of soup .
they have $ _num_ mimosas and bloody mart all day .
i did not like the lobster bisque , it was too salty .
overall , it was not bad , not great .
we walked by oyster bay and decided to try it out .
the manager was very rude and said that we were out of hand .
long store short we will not be back .
when i tried to tell the waiter that , he acted dumb .
there was no bugs in there food .
bland sauces .
mediocre service .
breakfast at denny 's would be an improvement .
wo n't eat there again .
i 've had $ _num_ steak before that was much better .
they could n't even get a grilled cheese sandwich right .
the food was an ultimate disappointment for how overpriced it is .
i guess that 's what you get for it being $ _num_ .
the pancakes were just pancakes .
nothing special about this place .
we waited _num_ minutes for food that was n't worth recommending .
you wo n't see me coming back for breakfast .
thats probably the only pro for this place .
this place is awful .
the food was terrible and extremely overpriced .
the wine list was insulting .
if you are looking for a nice wine list , try denny 's instead .
stay far , far away from oyster bay .
i got _num_ shrimps .
i was very disappointed .
the clams was good but the mahi mahi and angel hair pasta were mediocre .
it was an eggplant with ricotta and a marinara sauce .
however , i spent $ _num_ on ricotta cheese .
i 'm not rushing to get back to this place .
the oysters were so small i needed _num_ or _num_ to cover the cracker .
two thumbs down .
skip this place and go to the buffet at bellagio .
lobster bisque was luke warm , salty & with no lobster .
instead they direct you to the hilton .
but i 'm your customer , not the hilton 's .
this place is the worst .
but _num_ shrimp .
i told the waiter , and he literally was like `` yeah . ''
this is quite sad since this was our favorite seafood place in vegas .
overpriced and disappointing .
not squid .
it 's extremely bad quality food and very over-priced .
overall a terrible dining experience , i will not be coming back .
i wish it could be a negative _num_ stars !
the manager does n't care ... ... .
the employees do n't care ... you have to pay !
not worth the high price for low quality food .
their shrimp linguine special is plain and disgusting .
my coke was flat .
yikes , the food here was terrible .
i rose to leave and informed she had just dumped a nice possible tip .
if your looking for great italian food , this is not it .
food is just so so , and expensive .
over priced and just paying for ambiance .
if your into ambiance , then go for it .
wife ordered pasta with mussels , and the mussels were small and not fresh .
my pasta with meat sauce was nothing special .
good service and bad food is nothing to bring me back .
stopped by for a sunday morning breakfast .
both of us ordered eggs benedict and a bloody mary .
the eggs were overdone .
and just a poorly made and nasty tasting bloody mary .
with so many choices for breakfast , just go somewhere else .
stopped in for lunch and was not impressed .
warning : the shrimp cocktail is four pieces for $ _num_ .
awkward .
i will not be coming back.
the service was the worst .
food was not even good .
save yourself the headache , pass this one up , and go elsewhere .
turned out to be twenty dollars on a _num_ dollar order .
i could barley keep it down after i left .
aside from that , the service was pretty horrible .
will not be returning .
the server was short and borderline rude .
mind you , the restaurant was empty .
the chicken breast was overcooked and very tough .
i literally used a steak knife and it was still a struggle .
you would be better off staying in a walmart parking lot .
the oasis was a much better choice .
steak is not hard to be amazing .
when i eat steak out i need to have my socks blown off .
the steak was fine but as i said not amazing .
the lobster here was overcooked and on the chewy side .
never , send food back .
a few shakes was not enough .
i ordered the filet mignon and it was not impressive at all .
the shrimp were ok , but the crab legs were horrible .
having learned our lesson , we did n't opt for dessert .
i just do n't understand why this place is like a landmark in lv .
the steak itself was nothing i would brag about .
that 's really not acceptable at a high end steakhouse .
in one word to describe the whole meal , bland .
you ca n't pick your veggie , it 's just whatever they give you .
there are only _num_ potatoes to choose from baked or mashed , boring .
lastly , the wine selection is truly poor .
_num_ of _num_ stars .
steak was a good cut but flavor was lacking .
too smoky tasting with no seasoning .
service was extremely rushed .
not worth the walk through nasty circus circus .
the prime rib i ordered was a hot mess .
just disappointing .
but the bone in ribeye was poor .
i did n't complain - just knew it was my last trip here .
went here with a group of friends and was disappointed .
_num_ ) at $ _num_ for a filet , you expect something really good .
the steak had absolutely no taste whatsoever .
the service was very mediocre .
any of these i listed blow this one out of the water .
no more .
so sad to say good bye , but i must .
i would not go back .
service while kind was pretty forgettable .
if you want good steaks try the station casino steakhouses !
this was my 5th , and last time here .
the first _num_ times i came here were amazing .
not this time .
lucky us that we got the worst waiter in las vegas !
this guy obviously hated food , and hated his job .
the food comes out , no sauce .
he comes out _num_ minutes later with some brown sauce that looked like gravy .
the quality of the meat was mediocre at best .
the only redeeming part of the meal was the salad .
i 'll put it like this my appetizer was better than my steak .
the bread basket was kind of boring .
overall it was n't worth the money and i definitely wo n't come back .
i strongly suspect that most yelp reviews on the steakhouse are not legitimate .
if you are wondering what select grade meat tastes like go here .
i do n't even want to get into their disgusting side dishes and salads .
i feel the steak was mediocre .
i would not recommend this for the $ they charge .
the seafood sampler appetizer was truly horrible .
the food is bland at best , use some seasoning ... .
i was extremely disappointed .
the oysters were tiny and my steak was bland .
i got potatoes instead of rice and they were serving arrowhead bottled water .
the bad part is the service sucks !
save your money , you can do better .
everything else was poorly prepared , rather like diner food .
if you are not all ordering steak , skip it !
do n't put bacon in everything , many people can not eat .
the wild rice was overcooked and extremely salty .
the fish was not cooked correctly .
the asparagus was ok , but simply cooked .
dried out and no flavor !
we did n't even want our leftovers .
what a disappointment !
half way through the meal he asked me to try it .
it was as tough as shoe leather .
he wished he had sent it back after the first bite .
however the atmosphere could only be described as uncomfortable .
this must have been a very awkward situation for their waiter .
steak was hard to chew without taste .
i was going to ask for ketchup for my steak to make a point .
i do not recommend this steak house .
not even close to prime quality .
service was slow , disinterested , but polite .
the waiter said sure and returned with steak sauce and hot sauce bottles .
i prefer to just not come back , and avoid making a fuss .
however , other reviews mention flavorless steaks .
in the meantime , i would avoid at all cost .
what a seedy , dark , dirty and creepy looking casino this is .
my husbands meal was just as bad , if not worse .
this review will probably get the same canned response the other reviews got .
not worth the trip .
skip this place and stay on the strip .
this was by far the worst service and food i 've had .
it was severely over cooked it was crunchy and though to eat .
it took over _num_ mins for my replacement meal .
i cancelled the meal as i lost my appetite from waiting .
a few servers were appalled at the lack of concern from there manager .
my boyfriends steak was also over cooked .
we got _num_ pretzels - cinnamon , jalapeo cheese , almond , and pepperoni .
i 've had many pretzels and this place will be a pure disappointment !
i 'm giving this one star too many .
shame on mgm for keeping this place open .
i assumed mgm had it and it would be good .
the worst dough of a pretzel i ever tasted .
the cheapest sandwich starts at $ _num_ .
when i go to subway i really do n't expect much .
i get that the veggies will be limp from sitting out all day .
i was standing there and he totally ignored me .
my husband corrected him and he just seemed so irritated .
these owners hire people who do not want to work here .
basically paid _num_ $ for lettuce , two strips of bacon and cheese .
$ _num_ bucks for two _num_ inch combos .
hd owner for _num_ yrs .
unfortunately these guys are not honest business people .
very low miles and _num_ years left on the extended warranty .
las vegas harley tried to steal it .
plain and simple .
terrible experience !
when i went back , they treated me like it was my fault !
terrible place.
a site that stands apart with reviews you can trust ... .
it all goes downhill from here .
the thing came out with hardly any pink at all .
totally overcooked .
he ate a few bites and pushed it aside .
flavorless .
it must have really been bad because he usually loves ribeye .
but ... they were undercooked and the batter had zero flavor .
sides are incredibly mediocre .
i noticed the _num_ star reviews are mainly from out of towners .
hardly any locals who know better .
do n't let del frisco 's happen to you .
you 're wrong !
del frisco is not the best steak restaurant in las vegas .
i 'm not sure it 's even in the top five .
the word `` tired '' comes to mind .
this was by far the most disappointing meal of the trip .
it was a thursday night and the restaurant was not that busy .
the porterhouse was ordered medium-rare and the filet was ordered medium .
my date sent her filet back because it was a long way from medium .
the shrimp on my date 's filet was absolutely rotten .
you could see the kosher salt crystals on the outside of the steak .
i was not that impressed with del frisco 's .
i can understand how some people like it , but not me .
i had the fillet trio , with three different sauces and was satisfied .
asparagus , grilled mushrooms , potatoes were nothing to write home about .
wine list was very comprehensive , and way overpriced .
very difficult to find a good deal on the wines .
horrible !
this location is nothing like it sadly .
it has a old school las vegas feel off the strip .
i remember getting the seafood platter which was pretty good .
it had an assortment of shrimp , stone crab and oysters .
i had some of the prime ribeye with potatoes au gratin .
the sauteed mushrooms were good too .
i was a little disappointed .
it was n't , at least in my opinion .
the rib-eye was ok and the sides were boring and bland .
also the atmosphere was off .
greatly disappointed at this place !
but overall , including service - would not come back again !
i 'm not sure why everyone raves about this steakhouse .
our server was great but the food can only be described as mediocre .
the rib-eye was ok but not spectacular .
manager was rude , and dismissive when we questioned restaurant 's corkage policy .
an upscale steak house that does n't offer corkage ?
only the second time in my life i 've been refused corkage .
will never return to del frisco 's unless they change their policy .
very disappointing meal .
i do n't get the rave about this place .
i do n't understand how it has survived all these years .
i lost my appetite .
the wine list was enormous and lacking a sommelier .
ridiculous .
skip it .
my husband and i came here this past friday night .
my steak was cook right , but there was a major lack of flavor .
it tasted like a plain piece of meat .
not too sure .
do not waste your time here .
place is so overrated .
also , they refused to allow separate checks , etc .
this place was awful .
the wine was over priced and under aged .
however it fell short of my expectations .
i had a shrimp cocktail appetizer which was very boring .
over price , i cook better steaks than this place .
not too impressed at all .
my girlfriend ate the filet mignon and that was so so .
it was really overpriced for the steak that i ordered .
but for my steak that i ordered i wasnt too happy .
however , we were not that impressed with the steaks .
i 've had much better for way less .
the only high point of the meal was the lobster mac and cheese .
we also ordered lobster tails which were served with no butter .
del frisco was just plain mediocre .
the service is awful and pretentious .
the food is mediocre at best .
the shrimp cocktail tasted stale as if it sat in the fridge all day .
the mixed drinks were weak .
the wine list does not offer an adequate international selection .
spend your money elsewhere .
i am local and have eaten here before , probably _num_ 1/2 years ago .
this particular visit was less than stellar .
calamari appetizer was ok , nothing to write home about .
then when they brought it back out , it ended up being medium well .
and at $ _num_ for spinach , this was actually insulting .
could it have been just a bad experience on this particular visit ?
and in vegas folks , there is no lack of excellent steakhouses .
not worth the time & money .
the customer service was definitely a 5-star , hostess & waitress were friendly .
_num_ lobster mac was a shell of what it used to be .
about half the portion and barely any lobster .
the whole evening was lackluster .
the restaurant failed us this time in so many ways .
ive been home _num_ weeks now and i havent received anything from him .
what a shame !
one server waited on us - rushed through the menu .
once the food arrived , it was not up to standard .
steak was not cooked well and the cut of meat was poor .
as well , the drinks did not taste fresh .
lastly , the birthday we mentioned during the reservation was forgotten .
it 's been a month and she never called .
the atmosphere might have been ok except for the horrible smell .
i have severe allergies to gluten and corn .
furthermore , the steak was $ _num_ .
i fed the rest of that expensive steak to my dog .
do yourself a favor , go elsewhere .
no way .
not a chance .
very , very poor service .
mediocre food .
will not be going back .
my brother went here previously and told me that it was outstanding .
so , i could n't wait .
but the service was slow .
but my steak was not good .
when i complained , they tried to convince me that it was cooked properly .
meanwhile i checked out my buddies steaks and they all looked overcooked too .
i do n't care if they are busy since that is no excuse .
we spent $ _num_ + $ _num_ tip .
the lobster mac and cheese could use a little more lobster .
my wife 's steak was a little under cooked .
the filet mignon was ok .
i was starving after a long flight .
i was wrong .
for my second drink i asked for less lemon and that did n't happen .
dry bone-in ribeye .
the service is always slow the food is never cooked right .
the only thing we enjoyed here was the lemon cake .
super disappointed with my experience tonight .
the hostess staff is completely clueless , and worthless .
we went to the restaurant to try their summer pre fixe menu pairings .
not very classy .
let me be clear , the food was not terrible .
i could n't have been happier about them .
she should not be in customer service .
she has worked as one for _num_ and i was one for _num_ years .
it was embarrassing and just plain awful .
not only dollar wise , but also reputation wise .
big surprise no one has contacted me to follow up .
given such poor service by a waiter named tommy .
overrated .
my father had the bone in cowboy steak that was like shoe leather .
there is no excuse for , this type of treatment .
tommy surely does .
ordered a steak medium well .
completely lost my appetite .
that and the sewer smell = never coming back .
have been here many times and service has never been an issue .
so we were all confused .
of course , by this time , our friend had already finished his steak .
needless to say , we wo n't be back .
honestly , not good .
it 's a noisy place that they squeeze too many customers in bar area .
however , the service and their seafood are unacceptable .
the shrimp looks huge , but taste really hard .
we talked to the server the shrimp seems overcooked .
he did n't say anything at all then walked away !
this is my first time having oyster but no water in each shell !
the sides , too , were disappointing .
the lobster mac and cheese was watery , lacking in both flavour and lobster .
one to miss .
when i walked in , it was all men which was weird .
tv in the dining room in the steakhouse ?
no thank you .
eh , it really was n't all that good .
we ordered crab cakes and calamari to share and it was average .
biggest mistake i 've ever made .
before the plate hit the table i could tell it was over cooked .
the manager asks what 's wrong .
because none of what i ate feels good in my stomach .
at least then my nails would be done .
but the rest , is upsetting when think anymore about it .
the margarita is probably made from a mix from costco .
the bone-in filet mignon is nicely done but the asparagus is too chewy .
service was slow and arrogant .
it felt more like an black angus experience than a high end restaurant .
every time i am in vegas .
the quality has gone down noticeably .
steak was over cooked .
an absolute joke .
_num_ hours later still no food .
left $ _num_ with my to cover my share of food i never got .
i talked to the manager and told her to everything .
_num_ hours later and nothing , my friends finished dinner .
consumer beware : you are expected to verify your steak .
we walked in to sit at the bar .
the bar area smelled like mold and mildew .
very disappointed .
sadly so excited to come here but so so disappointed !
never ever anyone had to send anything back .
here at las vegas location too much black pepper on everything !
someone tell the chef you can not replace taste with black pepper .
it was cold .
asked for warm and came back with another cold batch .
sorry we are at a private business with _num_ persons and a hefty tab .
three other persons had their filets returned for being cooked wrong .
i give it _num_ stars because wait staff did not cook the food .
it 's not their fault .
wish i had a better experience .
steak was too dry !
not cool !
cheesy .
i thought wolfgang puck , the famous chef would have better tasting dishes ... .
she had been there several times before - all good experiences .
after our evening there , i would never go back .
_num_ minutes later , our wine arrived .
the food was mediocre at best .
the food was n't horrible ... just nothing special .
awful experience at normally reliable restaurant .
service was slow and inattentive .
food was overcooked , undercooked , or came out cold or soggy .
( though i will be back for the lobster club at lunch .
after much hype about the lobster club , we went for lunch last weekend .
the lobster club and soft shell crab sandwich were $ _num_ each .
while it had a lot of lobster , it was completely bland .
the toasted bread was too hard for such delicate meat .
the crab po boy was also bland and forgettable .
i tried my friend 's french onion soup and mushroom ravioli .
the soup was too sweet and the ravioli was under cooked .
i love al dente but this was sticking to my teeth .
the best things we had were the lasagna , fries , and coffee .
the service was nice but so fucking lazy .
it was n't crowded and the staff was just hanging out .
for a $ _num_ , i do n't think it was worth it .
it was basically a breaded and fried chicken breast with very little sauce .
that was a disappointment as well , but that was just one server .
i will not be visiting this place again .
it was n't the food , not at all .
the service was terrible .
this was very mediocre .
i mean , anywhere else , i 'd say meh ... it was ok .
but this is vegas .
not very appetizing , right ?
the fries that came with my sandwich were also quite cold .
so why were my fries cold ?
friendly waiter , but not enough to save the whole restaurant .
i sat inside ( outside was a longer wait ) .
this is another wolfgang puck restaurant that i was disappointed by .
servers , almost the same attitude .
i 'm not kidding , that 's what she said .
it was the same the second time we went there , if not worse .
for my second course , i had to try one of his famous pizzas .
my friend ate one piece and i did n't even finish mine .
for dessert , we shared the chocolate beignets .
this was the one course where the portion size was appropriate .
another disappointment was the service .
i also would have expected the server to do something about the disappointing pizza .
no problem , neither of us wanted to take it home .
all in all it was n't a bad meal .
omg it was already too late .
i 'd never go back to this place b/c of that waitress .
this place was awful .
i was so disappointed .
the service was extremely slow .
i was quiet disappointed .
i guess i should have checked yelp first .
needless to say , i 'm never coming back here .
terrible service .
no way .
my girlfriends gnocchi was decent but the lobster in my lobster club was rotten .
no more !
i only ordered one but it 's just an appetizer , why not ?
the evening here was somewhat disappointing .
we then waited over _num_ minutes for our drinks to arrive .
the dining room was only half full on a sunday evening .
i 'm sorry that such dishonest people work at your restaurant wolfgang = ( .
not super crispy , but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland .
for the price of $ _num_ though ?
roasted chicken with bbq sauce pizza : bf did not like this at all .
sauce was lacking and chicken was dry .
honestly , the flavor just tasted off to me .
looks plain and tastes like it too !
veggies ( brussel sprouts ) were pretty good .
overall , for the price we are paying , i expected more .
really extremely slow bad service .
our waitress was nice but she never checked up on us .
the food was not good either for contemporary american food .
wasting my money on food is one thing but wasting my time too ?
i thought i 'd get pizza with no cheese .
that 's odd , but whatever .
so i get the chopped vegetable salad with the one dressing they can offer .
i was dissapointed , i expected a little better from this celebrity chef .
while i enjoy a few other wolfgang puck restaurants this one is just terrible .
they messed up our order on more then one occasion .
i just did n't enjoy my meal or the service .
i recommend not wasting your money here .
two stars because though the food was n't terrible , neither was it amazing .
our daughter by this time was almost asleep at the table .
for an entre i was torn between the rib eye and something more italian .
sadly , it was over-cooked and rubbery .
the bun was stale and dry ... really dry and stale .
so we walked out and took our business to another restaurant .
short review : best calamari , worst service .
long review : we ordered the calamari and a margarita pizza with goat cheese .
no one checked on us until we were done eating .
it 's not as if they were really busy .
i was highly disappointed .
but this was horrible .
was it the best shrimp cocktail i 've ever had ?
this was a huge disappointment .
last night my dinner was very disappointing .
the cheese ravioli was soooo salty .
the water was not cold .
and the wait staff was blah .
short ribs _num_ percent fat .
caesar salad had too much dressing .
drinks took too long to come .
not a good place for a group of nine .
the _num_ cheese ravioli was great but the service was awful .
calamari was too salty .
the menu is so mediocre as is the service and the portions are ridiculous !
horrible experience !
service is slow and food is not properly cooked .
the service was terrible .
we have been waiting over _num_ minutes for _num_ burgers .
by far , the worst service i have experienced ever .
the gnocchi - cold .
the pizza - cold .
despite talking to the manager , the service still did n't improve .
simply put , i will not be returning .
disappointing service !
all in all my halibut was flavorless and the service was disappointing .
the worst restaurant experience i 've had in vegas .
no apology 's were made .
shrimp pizza was just ok , you would expect it to blow you away !
the food was good but overpriced and the service was just minimal .
i would not go here again .
yep , i am still waiting .
the donut was empty .
wrong .
the chocolate cream filled was hardly `` filled '' .
iced coffee is terrible .
went in last sunday around _num_ and they basically had nothing left .
a couple apple fritters and some donut holes .
you also have the option of chipotle , panda express , or mcdonalds .
this location does not exist .
three other people left who were waiting before me .
terrible service .
the _num_ counter members were just sitting there !
after they closed my branch on jones the overall service level is just horrendous .
in addition , the restaurant could use more creative menu items .
first of all this place should be called motel and not hotel .
well the place is pet friendly so that could explain the smell .
thank god i did n't have a black light with me .
counters in the lobby and bar area are dirty and sticky .
the longer we stayed the more they lost our rating !
it had no sheets or blankets .
there were none in the closet .
someone finally showed up with a pillow and blanket around 1am .
not very expensive .
place kind of feels like death .
a/c in the rooms was clearly an add on after the places were built .
not to mention the remote you use to control these things makes no sense .
i was here for a conference , so they provided box lunches .
if you want cheap check out the casino royale .
this really sucked big time .
i wo n't be coming back to this place .
whatever you get in low rates just is n't worth this garbage .
but i got ripped off that night .
it is old and tired .
the furniture is old and worn out as is the carpet .
i spent about _num_ hours in this place and was happy to get out .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
but it gets worse .
my husband and i are really chill and laid back folks .
boy was i wrong !
parts of the bathroom was just old , worn , and dirty .
the shower head was way too low !
this is such a scam .
the room was $ _num_ dollars , but using the internet totaled $ _num_ ?
the $ _num_ suites were great .
not the alarm you want when you got in at 4am from the bar .
if i could give _num_ stars ... i would .
trust me ... it was bad !
i hate this place & i will never ever go back .
aside from this , it 's like an apartment .
if i was going to vegas i would not stay here .
$ _num_ for _num_ hours of wifi .
could n't get out of there soon enough .
lots of airport noise and no vending machines with snacks .
i would not repeat another stay here .
too many other reasonably priced options .
i do n't even know where to begin !
this hotel does n't even deserve a _num_ star .
motel _num_ is cheaper and the rooms are basically the same .
cheap !
hotel staff was the worst .
i wish yelp had _num_ stars because that 's all this place deserves .
it looks like an old apartment complex with weird rooms .
this hotel was the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
i wish i could give it _num_ stars .
the room we were at was really dirty .
the sink was really small too .
everything in the room seemed dirty and stained .
the worst part came when i was actually going to sleep .
it was just disgusting and horrible .
the bed was super comfortable and so was the pull out couch bed .
the hotel actually looks like an old apartment complex .
banquet facilities horrible and unorganized .
no biggie .
also , i overheard another guest requesting for another room with a microwave .
get your shit together , alexis apartment complex !
gross .
however , i would not stay here again .
the vegas strip has spoiled me too much .
conclusion sleep in your car !
no gambling .
cheap .
filthy !
our toilet was covered in dried urine .
converted old apartment complex - large motel .
not a resort .
no elevator .
guess i know why the staff is sub par .
horrible from the very moment i walked in .
even as a time share , this place is terrible .
i have never in my life experienced a hotel worse than this one !
it completely ruined our experience of vegas !
they offered no apology and refused to give us any compensation regarding this issue .
rat hole !
windows did not work at all .
very depressing indeed .
not a nice hotel to stay in .
they have roaches , and it 's not very clean .
this place is awful .
all of my stuff got wet and some of it was damaged .
dont waste your money .
do not do it !
they stole over $ _num_ from us .
they did absolutely nothing .
my family and i stayed there _num_ weeks ago .
the whole facility does not have any queen beds so keep that in mind .
this was the case in all _num_ rooms .
so no room cleaning at all .
i would n't recommend it if you have kids .
this is an old place , despite the recent renovations .
i have no place to complain , given the price we paid .
do n't stay here if you 're looking for 3-5 star quality .
you 're not gon na find it .
and the guests that are here during our stay seem friendly too .
i 'm too high maintenance for this ... lol !
all over the kitchen counter and traveling behind the mini fridge .
unfortunately did n't get to see the pool or anything else .
a plus we could n't hear the planes .
this was one of the worst hotel 's accommodations i have ever experienced !
and this is one of the `` renovated '' rooms i 've just described .
not to mention the shabby customer service .
thoroughly disgusting !
this place was cheap , but too cheap .
not in the `` it 's a bargain '' kinda way .
do n't waste your money here .
we got stuck with a room in the old section and it was miserable .
the front desk manager was extremely rude and completely useless with my reservation .
i did not get my full refund back and they acted like nothing happened .
i would absolutely not book a room here again .
this is the most disgusting place i 've every stayed at !
i started off with _num_ and worked my way up to _num_ .
i finally got what i was expecting but first impression was horrible .
ps ... did i mention this place was a dump ?
first of all this place should be called motel and not hotel .
well the place is pet friendly so that could explain the smell .
thank god i did n't have a black light with me .
counters in the lobby and bar area are dirty and sticky .
he then left in an angry way and the problem was not resolved .
the deposit was only $ _num_ .
do not stay here .
do not stay here !
i did i lost my money !
now i 'm stuck in building _num_ .
hair in the sink and a used towel .
oh but wait ... it would n't take his money .
look , i could n't make this up if i tried .
hands down , the worst place ever !
the beds were horribly uncomfortable .
i seriously am making an appointment with my chiropractor because of the beds .
i 'm sorry i booked here .
there was nothing suite about it .
by far one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at .
however , the hotel is severely understaffed .
there was never not a long line at the front desk .
the food , while reasonably priced , just was n't very good .
the hot tub was lukewarm .
want to get some work done at the luxurious bedside desk ?
i 'm not kidding !
they also put me in the very last building on the property .
my room is _num_ miles from the lobby !
avoid !
i called again _num_ hours later since nothing had been done .
a lot of the outdoor safety lighting is out .
i would never stay here again .
i stayed here for _num_ days and _num_ night .
apparently non smokers do n't get the luxury of the smokers lol .
long story short , the system was down for my entire stay .
they did n't open the room .
i tried the new set of keys and nothing .
but he just tried the keys and nothing .
the front desk were rude in regards of calling cabs and assisting with issues .
i have stayed at the alexis twice before this last attempted reservation .
for the money the room and facilities were okay .
the bathroom tub was a mess however .
the last reservation was a total screw up .
i called the resort directly and was quoted one price in one phone call .
they would not adjust the rates as quoted on the phone originally .
with all the problems at check and the wrong type room being assigned .
this place sucks .
_num_ of _num_ pools closed .
front desk painfully slow .
no free internet ( _num_ $ per device for _num_ hours ) .
our bed did n't even have a fitted sheet or a comforter on it !
this hotel is beyond horrible .
the list of what 's wrong with this hotel goes on and on .
they did n't have any ready for us ( first strike ) .
now skip to the good part !
when they arrived , alexis park had no record of their reservation .
they were tired and just wanted a room to stay in .
( strike _num_ , you 're out !
do not waste your money on this hotel .
i can not believe what a terrible experience we had .
please do not book a room here .
i booked through expedia and hope to get a refund .
all in all , not one person is in charge here .
do not waste your hard earned money .
to my gay brothers and sisters ... ... do not lower your standards .
avoid at all costs !
the room had a peeling bathroom tub and sink .
it was disgusting all around .
yeah right , $ _num_ for this shit hole .
do n't try to save the buck or two .
this place is not worth it !
no luck .
we stayed the whole time without getting our room cleaned .
because no one would ever come .
they did n't have any .
ever .
one lousy convenience shop .
one lousy restaurant .
an old dated lobby .
carpet disgusting .
would not sit on it .
do n't stay here .
i should have kept my original reservation at another hotel .
does n't even deserve a star .
i was told all _num_ pools would be opened .
so i would assume we would wake up and shower .
she never called me back and seems to have avoided me .
only two pools are opened .
this place does n't ever deserve my one star !
the third pool was disgusting !
also , wifi is not free i believe it was $ _num_ a day .
the blinds were dingy , there was dust .
so gross .
and is easily _num_ times nicer than this dump .
filthy , roach infested .
this place is very user unfriendly .
the air conditioner is impossible to manage .
the shower and bath tub was chipped and scratched and needed to be replaced .
very old everything not very appealing .
this place is terrible .
i was wrong .
this was not our experience .
resorts before and this place does not make the cut .
other than that , everything else about this place is terrible .
do n't stay here .
by all means , take my money so i can vacation at this dump !
but never again will i stay at a place with this many bad reviews .
they changed our room and gave us a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience .
it was just so disgusting it does n't deserve even _num_ star !
surely is a stretch !
absolutely no compensation .
1st off they did not have enough blankets or sheets for us .
in the morning i woke up to _num_ in welcomed guest in our room .
so of course they has not cleaned the room before us .
next time i would rather sleep in my car then to stay here !
worst hotel experience ever !
there were so many things wrong with this hotel .
first of all , they had errors with saving reservations made on groupon .
second , the guy checking us in was so rude .
fourth , the room that i stayed in had dripping ac .
las vegas is in the desert and it is hot .
she had to sleep on the couch because it was bothering her .
only the big pool by the office has a water fountain .
this is n't the first time i 've been here .
the employees here have no pride in their place of business .
i 've argued with waitresses in the restaurant , etc .
i have stayed in numerous hotels and have never had such a bad experience .
i do n't even know where to start .
all three days we 've been here , have been unpleasant .
do n't understand that .
highly do not recommend .
the housekeeping is the worst as well .
nothing is ever clean and even the new sheets are usually dirty .
in a word ... eh lol .
do n't think we 'll be back here .
_num_ out of _num_ pools were closed in july .
sucked because that 's what i was most looking forward too .
i repeat do not stay here !
this place is ridiculous .
horrible service .
sue ?
found dark long hair on bath room floor , i am blonde .
not worth it .
i would have rather paid _num_ for _num_ nights and stayed someplace else .
i am not from the hotel business .
i dont know what information they should be looking for , but they are .
could have saved me a lot of stress over the past _num_ days !
from day one to our last day this stay here was horrible .
i made the mistake of buying a groupon for this place .
our room was slightly better than a motel _num_ .
this place might have been a diamond in the rough in the _num_ 's .
last time i was here was _num_ months ago and nothing had changed !
it 's an obvious problem !
we give this place a _num_ out of _num_ .
unlike some of the other reviews , we did not get the upgraded room .
thankfully we did not spend a lot of time in the room .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
the staff here ( save for one awesome valet ) were horrible .
these people were rude .
wtf ... no security cameras near rooms , so thieves have a great time .
nobody knew who is in charge and the front office staff was unprofessional .
worst hotel ever to exist .
i know that the hotel around are a little more expensive .
but i would pay more not to have to deal with the front desk .
most rude .
booked a room through groupon last month for my birthday , late arrival .
lastly , i got no sleep .
so annoying .
window view was just dead grass .
stayed here using a groupon $ _num_ a nite .
stayed here and drove into red rocks for climbing .
just a block away from hard rock cafe casino .
we had a _num_ % off from our hotel .
but i did n't pay much attention i thought i give it a try .
it was the worst experience ever !
i was checking and checking on my car the hole night .
this is horrible also btw !
overall if your on a very low low budget stay here i guess .
the desk clerk said it was n't their fault because it was back ordered .
no late checkout .
bathroom smelled like sewage .
no elevators to the second floor that i could see .
the worst hotel ever !
was suppose to stay _num_ nights , checked out after _num_ hours .
i should 've checked yelp first .
too tired to look for another room .
this place is crap .
the `` tv '' is a box from the _num_ 's .
the place is n't clean .
i walk around without shoes on the carpet and my feet turn black .
who seemed very careless and kept on putting my phone call on hold .
she gave me a price clients agreed on .
i then repeated myself for the second and then the third reservation .
big no no .
she then said she realized she did the mistake and she would fix it .
she never return my call .
a simple i am sorry to any client would have been appreciated .
i do n't want any of my clients to go through something like this .
i would never stay here again mainly because how rude i was treated .
this place is old & in some areas in poor condition .
it was old dirty & chipped .
third room was ok .
the rooms are ok but the water in the bath is weird .
in the end she refunded our money .
ok so i bought _num_ nights in groupon for this place .
they have the worst service ever !
first of all check in was a nightmare .
okay , so _num_ days later the charge plus the deposit appear again !
poor , poor customer service !
must say in the last few years quality has fallen .
restaurant is closed most days due to `` lack of business '' .
property is going through a slow death .
zero stars .
awful awful experience !
at this point it was the wee hours of the morning .
there are too many hotel options in vegas to go through the headache !
remember the last hotel scene in no country for old men ?
and you thought , that 's me , that 's where i belong .
so many reasons why you should n't stay here .
rooms are outdated and very dirty .
no water pressure in bathroom .
gross .
looks like a run down apartment complex .
no lighting between buildings .
wish i could give _num_ stars .
do n't walk -- run away !
think level _num_ commercial , level _num_ my room .
i went to mandalay bay for a difference of $ _num_ .
the staff had no interest in helping me .
horrible staff - horrible place .
and there 's no security !
i do n't even know where to begin .
they stated no and gave me another room .
the shuttle that picked me up at the airport was nice .
as i entered to lobby to check in the dread set in .
my hotel room was bad .
they never replaced the lamp .
it sat their broken in pieces all weekend .
the room was n't terrible -- just worn out and out of date .
the ac never did get the room cool so sleeping was a sweaty event .
as well .
not the worst dive but the biggest .
nothing so horrible that you 'd storm out .
not the best windows .
nothing impressive or exciting but served the purpose of providing a place to sleep .
the room i stayed in wasnt bad , it was a spacious suite .
i remember they did charge a hefty deposit upon check in .
i visited alexis park because my annual meeting was held there .
the food ( chicken , string beans , wild rice ) was good .
so much so that i did n't finish my food !
yes ladies and gentlemen , there was glass in my drink .
not a good place to stay .
by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
do not waste ur time ppl !
the place was horrible !
not a `` family '' venue at all .
the staff is n't allowed to let me see my room past 9pm .
poorly lit grounds , room quite disgusting .
did not feel clean .
second room was disgusting .
this is not a _num_ star as advertised .
they had billed my account , but then proceeded to give away the room .
i was attending a business conference at this property .
the experience from the very beginning was bad .
the a/c in the bedroom did not work .
even though it is called resort , it is actually a motel setting .
the property totally lacks any security .
very loud music till the morning .
could not sleep .
we did not sleep that night dealing with the situation .
she never returned any phone calls for the messages left .
she advised to call the gm instead .
the hotel did not make any effort to address the issues .
property does not look at all like the pictures on the website or groupon .
this place let a possible renovation go down the drain .
it is a cheap spot to stay but this definitely is not my style .
the fridge did not work at all .
the tv downstairs could not access all the channels .
the carpet and couches had these horrid stains .
this place sucks .
the tv had like _num_ channels .
the decor is very dated .
cars are frequently broken into !
i had no hot water for _num_ days .
this place is a complete shit show .
do not stay here .
first room had no running water in the bathroom sink .
i 'm not sure how that gets overlooked .
wo n't be staying here again .
this place is horrible .
do not stay here .
secondly , i have back to back reservations .
when i went back to my room , my things were missing .
i tried to find them and they could not locate them .
obviously housekeeping stole it when they cleaned the room .
lastly , this place is filthy .
this joke of a business did n't even decide to make it right .
extremely disappointed by the customer service received .
their systems were down and they could not find our reservations .
after getting back up to her , she still could not find the reservation !
still no refund of $ _num_ that i was overcharged .
this place is a complete ripoff .
cars are frequently broken into !
i had no hot water for _num_ days .
this place is a complete shit show .
do not stay here .
worst customer service .
rude receptionist .
appropriate information has been attached behind this report .
no phone has been turned in .
at this point , i was getting frustrated .
this was by far the worst hotel i 've stayed in .
it was n't very clean .
the `` kitchen '' had no utensils , paper towels , no soap .
for a quick trip , this was n't a deal breaker .
two security guards came , one of which was a total dick .
just to find out that their shitty door needed to be forced closed .
i booked a room here for a one night stay .
i waited for _num_ minutes and no one ever came .
i spend _num_ hours trying to finally get into a clean room .
i would never want to stay here again .
i would much rather spend a little extra and stay somewhere else .
stay far away , or just stay at the hard rock !
this is not a good start to my experience with them .
do not stay here it 's horrible here are my reasons as to why !
after check it will take you about _num_ minutes to walk to your room .
once you get to your room it looks dirty and outdated .
the beds are hard and they do n't proved much blankets .
this property does n't operate this way , everything about it is uncomfortable .
not to mention the countless bugs thought out !
horrible horrible horrible !
i wish i was able to give them negative stars .
i do n't even know where to begin !
they show no care when it comes to offering hospitality to their guest !
we stayed for one night .
the sink in the room was dirty and there was no water pressure .
it was a last minute booking and we 'd probably not stay here again .
blankets are sheets ... not blankets .
staff is rude .
turn down service did n't show up .
never had problems until now .
a year ago we paid for an event , did n't use , rescheduled .
horrible !
could n't find my payment .
then tag on service charge n tax .
a ball room that was originally $ _num_ went to almost $ 1,000 .
well we had to pay additional $ _num_ to have n ball room .
when there were not service charge n tax .
if i could give a zero star i would .
bad idea .
room was fairly outdated as well as the entire complex .
even on a budget i will stay away next time .
empty soda machines .
never again .
disappointing because the lobby looks very nice .
but my room in building _num_ was awful .
garbage on floor , bug crawling on wall .
open the frog to a stench of beer .
you can feel the room shake every time a plane takes off .
lastly , the alley are very dimly lit .
not a great combination when in a not so safe part of town .
if you have already booked it , cancel your reservation !
the furniture in the living room area was dirty and stained .
the bathtub was cracking and gray in color from the dirt .
there is no way you would even step foot in the bathtub .
it 's also not the best area to be in .
you do not feel safe .
very loud and noisy .
i would n't even stay here for free .
if i could give negative stars i would .
this is the worse place i have ever stayed in for travel .
completely run down .
no blankets and the heaters were blowing semi cold air .
i had to get a refund for my remaining stay and book another place .
this place is beyond awful .
rooms - disgusting , never cleaned .
wifi - $ _num_ per day and it does n't work !
every person that works there is incompetent .
stayed in room _num_ they walk by you without a good morning or evening .
this was so disgusting .
then the tile around the toilet is cracking .
the sofa bed springs are obviously seen as soon as you open it up .
not a comfortable thing to sleep on .
do n't recommend this place one bit .
the rooms are decent but too bad the continental breakfast is n't worth crap .
do not waste your money .
once we got to our room , it was outdated but seemed decent enough .
tv in the living area did n't work .
could n't figure out how to turn the air on in the bedroom .
so the constant planes taking off was not fun .
avoid this place .
the lobby was nice but was not connected to the rooms .
the room was not as bad as i thought .
the living room was roomy as was the bedroom .
the staff were polite and helpful .
unfortunately , there are more bad things about this resort than good .
the resort is in need of a major renovations and just daily maintenance .
the bathtub was falling apart and it had mildew .
how old is this furniture ?
the hotel staff did n't seem to care about the issues we were having .
terrible .
however , on this stay rude .
no offer or promise to make it better next time .
nothing offered to compensate .
alexis park , you lost a customer .
so disappointed !
biggest mistake to book a room here !
between the hotel and the reservation site no one knows .
no where is that mentioned or was it mentioned when i asked .
next up my friend goes to check in .
worthless service from both ends .
clueless service from both ends !
beyond disappointed with that .
but after the first night the experience changed to pain .
the second night the biggest bite happened on my arm .
secondly , stated that there was n't any room available for another hour .
the room larger but it was n't impressive .
long story short , there are _num_ major issues cleanliness and customer service .
worst customer service i 've ever received .
she was terrible !
would not stay here again , and i 'm not very picky .
the carpet was not vacuumed .
the room did not smell fresh and was generally dirty .
the furniture was not only outdated , but old , dirty and torn .
i would n't stay there even if you paid me .
after seeing the first room , obviously we did not order food .
i wish i could give zero stars !
hotel is dirty and old .
manager richard is beyond rude .
he would not help with anything , and is completely useless .
i never actually had a room here so i ca n't comment on that .
they all mentioned the same thing .
the wait was long as there are few tables to seat .
restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners .
a common problem with most indian restaurants like this one .
so this may be a bit biased .
_num_ ) people in vegas do n't know what good indian food is .
my thinking is either _num_ or _num_ .
the next time i am in vegas i will skip this one .
i would be giving this place a _num_ but they really really irritated me .
now the third time i go in there , they were down right rude .
we went to india oven down on sahara and las vegas blvd .
if it were in my hands i would give this place negative ratings .
me and my friends went here reading all the nice yelp reviews .
she , could barely eat two pieces of it .
we did not require our reservation as the dining room was empty .
food is pretty good but service is not good at all .
it was ok but nothing special .
my daughter and son in law ate and i ordered another meal .
unfortunately the service was very poor .
the reviews were also favorable so in we went .
* rice and garlic naan were good .
my indian coworker recommended mint - i guess i 'll try that one next .
the chicken is less smoky and had less tandoori seasoning than other places .
_num_ star for free mango lassi thru yelp checkin .
bad service .
very unhappy not recommended .
i was n't super impressed with the india palace buffet .
another bad visit .
but after renovation , it seemed like they became desperate for money .
prices went up , i guess to pay for all the upgrades .
things went downhill .
every indian restaurant serves rice with the ( already overpriced ) entrees .
not here .
waiter asked if we wanted rice ; we said of course .
so we did not go back all this time .
went back again now , same thing .
and obviously , i do n't want to be scammed .
so , i would never go back .
goodbye , india palace .
but it was not worth getting sick for .
however , what was very disappointing was the portion size of the dishes .
no exaggeration !
same with the eggplant -- barely enough to share with another person .
buffet lunch may be a better deal .
no future visits here .
we ordered a goat dish , a lamb dish , and samosas .
a short , curly , kind of hair .
also they has a $ _num_ for $ _num_ deal which looked good .
they do n't have too many parking spots .
typical indian restaurant .
horrible service , they never even cared to apologize for the inconvenience .
skip this one if you can .
i used to come here but no more india palace for me.
never call them for an order .
the last three times they cancelled my order .
i do n't know their excuse for the third time .
not ordering from them again .
thinking diamond in the rough ?
not quite .
not really bad but not great .
plus the onions & such were not cooked all the way .
i do n't eat raw onions ( they barely cooked them ) .
do n't know we would go back unless friends absolutely wanted to go there .
they do n't honor yelp deals .
the management at this place has no regard for it 's patrons whatsoever .
though i do n't work in the restaurant industry i still have work tomorrow .
either way service being shitty , not the only place .
nowhere do they inform you of the new prices until u get the bill !
glasses smelled similar to foul meat which means not cleaned thoroughly .
but the attitude not so good .
so you have a $ _num_ for $ _num_ deal at yelp .
sorry to say this is not a restaurant i would return to .
why they did this on a friday night is totally beyond me .
all of us in our group could feel that the food was old .
the taste was ok , but most importantly i ate healthy food .
false advertising .
they deserve to lose business .
not to mention a side of regular , plain rice is $ _num_ .
service was terrible never got to the food part .
worst of all we came to know about this place through family friends .
awful ... the restaurant was completely empty .
i 've eaten here twice .
mess .
i 'm very patient , but not _num_ minutes of no service patient .
i wo n't be going back again .
and it was during the lunch buffet so we could n't use the voucher .
wait ... why did i come here ?
he came back really rude and said mean words while we had our food .
i was really offended .
such a bad experience after an amazing night .
was excited to check out vegas indian food .
he said , oh yes , no problem it 's $ _num_ !
for a cash only place , one would think the driver has change .
do you think i 'm that stupid ?
there 's not gon na be a next time !
we had visited the place during 4th july weekend .
the lunch buffet did n't really have enough options if you were a vegetarian .
the curries were ordinary , and surprisingly even the breads were n't good .
if you want friendly staff this is n't the spot .
scary neighborhood too .
terrible place.
they charge for a buffet which hardly has variety .
waste of money .
on top of it the food tastes bad .
this was around 2:00 pm .
did n't look freshly made .
avoid non veg if possible .
most of the dishes seemed to lack any taste to it .
maybe ala carte from the menu would have been a better choice .
staff and other aspects were not a big worry .
though charged _num_ _num_ year olds full price for the buffet .
would not recommend .
very bad food .
not of good quality .
paneer tikka was n't grilled and was fried instead of that .
would n't recommend it .
very disappointing .
this was poor customer service .
do n't try it .
regards , goat curry with spinach .
to call this dish disappointing is an understatement .
you will leave frustrated .
no rice or naan was served with any of the above dish .
poor customer service management .
i guess the moto of india palace is , make money while you can .
really bad customer service , food was also not that great .
will never go there or recommend anyone .
worst restaurant ever .
how rude .
the food was cold and bland .
the ambiance was not good .
the silverware and plates were average to low quality .
they charge $ _num_ for the rice and $ _num_ for the _num_ bread .
ridiculous prices for such small serving sizes .
very disappointed .
please do not use groupon for this restaurant , they rip you off .
i had the worst service today at the resturant .
given all these facts i will never set foot in that resturant again .
had the worst customer service experience possible .
even if the food is good , that doesnt explain the bad customer service .
these guys are really mean and rude .
update : do not ever order from these people .
they are shady , flakey and extremely rude !
food is good but very bad service .
brought my family here on father 's day and it was the worst ever .
as soon as we got there we were constantly rushed .
i was like wth you need to chill !
oh and the garlic was neither garlicky nor buttery but it sure was burnt .
this is ridiculous .
bad and overpriced food with bad service .
very disappointed .
$ _num_ for what amounts to be appetizers .
these guys are crap .
buffet on weekday which i went was not delicious .
customer service regarding cleaning and removing plates is pathetic .
it 's waste !
not at all worth your money and very few items in the buffet !
they do n't even the remove the plates in buffet !
service are really bad and people are not friendly .
it seems that if you are not indian then you are not welcomed there .
place smell strong , i must say i unpleasant smell .
never ever paid for their rice that come with the stew .
those guys ripped me off with both .
now let us talk about food
i would give them honestly for the food only _num_ and half star .
it 's the worst indian food ever , service is too bad .
i do n't know how people rated this place _num_ .
then why the hell they kept it in the menu i do n't know .
do n't even try this restaurant .
expensive and does n't deserve even _num_ % of the price .
yelp deal is not worth .
taste was ok , but it is deep fried in batter .
tandoori roti was not good .
one of the worst indian food places in vegas .
this restaurant does n't know how to treat it 's customers !
that 's what the manager is saying and all of it pretty rude .
they are really ridiculous !
simply unprofessional and rude .
had to ask _num_ times to get water and silverware .
printing photos with celebrities on the wall does n't make the place nice !
good food but tried to use a restaurant.com certificate and they refused it .
nothing in the fine print said i could not use it tonight .
most expensive indian buffet i ever had .
to me it was not worth it .
to order all items are very pricey .
i will not visit again .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
food is not really fresh .
confused why so many good reviews in yelp .
the staff is n't polite .
my husband got sick right after eating buffet .
everything was so sour and poor quality .
very disappointed .
worst indian food ever !
there are much better indian restaurants in vegas .
sour food , bad service and not worth your penny !
worst north indian food ever !
stale food , bad service .
do n't ever take a buffet that is even worse .
this is not even close to what indian food should taste like .
pathetic !
what a waste of money .
not at all indian .
customer service at it 's worst .
the receipt for my to-go order was literally thrown at me .
this is not cheap delivery .
and it is n't like this place is short staffed .
food might be ok , but it does n't make up for atrocious service .
we 've been here plenty of times before but treated very rudely this time .
it was just plain disrespectful .
food is _num_ to _num_ star , on a good day .
the long wait is ridiculous here .
it makes no sense .
this is bad front end management .
horrible actually !
they 're excuse is they get backed up .
because they take too many patients at the same time .
the wait was been _num_ minutes in the waiting room alone .
have n't seen the doctor yet .
this staff are the most unprofessional staff i have ever encountered .
for this type of business you would imagine they would be professional , nope .
this office is unbelievable .
my 1st appointment was in march .
after sitting in their waiting room for _num_ hours without my child .
did n't mention that on the phone when they scheduled us mind you .
sure because i knew that before i drove _num_ minutes to be here .
uh , gross ?
none ... repeat , none of the dancers here were hot .
also , the stage dancers were lame !
here you just feel awkward .
if you 're drunk you can fake interest .
and per the others reviews , yes ... the men are not so hot .
the music 's not so great .
the lighting 's not so great .
would never pay for this total crap .
had several totally overpriced drinks ( $ _num_ for a sierra nevada ?
from a rude bartender .
me : no !
it was $ _num_ !
then , the show began and it was nothing like the video .
the guys get to just stand there , watch & enjoy .
largest club in the us or something like that , eh ?
we had what was apparently boxed wine at _num_ bucks a glass .
anyway - so the dancers were n't all that great for the most part .
they were so standard , i wanted to tell them to stop halfway through .
the room felt really empty !
it was n't anything to write home about .
the costco of vegas strip clubs .
there are no `` nice '' girls here .
do not go into the vip room .
do not go into the champagne booth .
having said that ... this club is awesome .
have fun , but do n't be a dumb ass !
way overpriced and rude staff .
disgusting !
way too overpriced .
i was not impressed with the girls .
the atm charges are out of control .
all these girls was just trying to hustle .
they did n't even cover even if you got bottle service .
this place is all about money and nothing else .
not cool .
not cool at all .
so less girls would mean less house fees for sapphire .
not sure if our tables were bad .
i had a pocket full of money and no women approached us .
drinks were ridiculously overpriced , $ _num_ for a _num_ oz bottle of water .
dude !
no way never again .
$ _num_ for a beer !
they must be smoking some bad stuff !
the choice of women was weak .
the place was said to have been a converted fitness club .
now , when sh*t like this goes down , i stick to my approach .
avoid eye contact as much as you can , and you 're gold .
we stayed about _num_ minutes then moved on to someplace else .
it was a big waste of $ _num_ and time .
this is probably one of the worst strip clubs in the us .
our limo driver took us here as some of our friends talked it up .
the bouncers were hella rude , stuck up , and full of themselves .
i do not recommend anyone coming here .
waste of time .
money was not an option but the club turned us all away !
we have never been so disrespected at the door in any establishment , any !
sapphire hates asians and black people i guess ?
unprofessional , would be too nice of a comment .
i would not even list this place as a last resort .
i cant even believe im putting one star .
no excuses here .
i got convinced by a friend to check that place out .
it is a large place , the largest in the world i 'm told .
my recommendation , pass on this place .
the girls here even sucked .
do n't do n't do n't do n't do n't do n't .
if anyone likes this club they are full of crap .
it was pretty much standing room unless we got bottle service .
some of these girls will try and rip u off !
$ _num_ for _num_ min .
only go here if you 're desperate .
the worst gentlemen 's club experience ever !
they stuck us for $ _num_ before we even sat down .
biggest sausage fest in las vegas .
more meat per square inch than a west german butcher shop .
rude waitresses and overpriced drinks ?
crappy layout and atmosphere ?
instead of trying to sell me the dream ?
_num_ to _num_ male to stripper ratio ?
she was the bomb .
however , the quality leaves much to be desired .
but they had happy hour and it cheap .
bucket of _num_ beers for only $ _num_ .
there were only about _num_ girls working at _num_ pm and _num_ were hot .
i brought a group of _num_ guys here and could not get seated .
why are the bouncers making business decisions ?
this is why people do n't return .
i will not be back .
because if you just happen to see an open seat forget it.
i think we were there a total of _num_ min .
this place is a joke they will hustle you plain and simple .
my girlfriend and i went here looking for a good time .
are you kidding me ?
terrible .
_num_ dollars .
$ _num_ a beer .
i am used to paying _num_ bucks a beer at most clubs in vegas .
but $ _num_ ?
for _num_ buds , and _num_ girls dancing on stage ?
not like this .
$ _num_ beers .
the wait staff sucks too .
i had a bad experience here .
_num_ your money !
later the stripper asked my other friend to pay as if they never paid .
they will try to get every penny out of your pocket .
_num_ watch out for the lap dances !
w. t. f .
only two dancers are dancing at the same time .
entry cost is $ _num_ dollars .
would i go there again ... probably not .
but hell it is vegas !
this was the first and last time i spend money at sapphire .
now for why i gave it less than _num_ stars .
since the cost of a mixed drink goes for $ _num_ ( i.e .
less than a handful ( literally ) were larger than b cups .
first , it was $ _num_ to get in per person .
we went on a tuesday night so the place was n't so busy .
also , about _num_ % of the girls were straight up ugly .
overall , go somewhere else , you will be disappointed .
so we get there , cover is $ _num_ , not $ _num_ .
no guys in sight , they must be in another room .
wrong .
male strippers are friday and saturday nights only .
no way no how the cab driver was not aware of this .
we 're less than _num_ minutes into being there and demand our money back .
no luck .
do n't waste your time and money !
do not waste your time !
we could n't believe it !
not the best strip club experience ever !
they also had an annoying dj and host that kept talking into the game .
the drinks were poorly made .
not here , my friends .
complete garbage !
_num_ dollar drinks !
r u kidding me ?
maybe start out with _num_ or so .
ummm there is n't really anywhere to go except down a hall .
so we went on wed night , not busy .
did i just hear that correctly ?
nobody really seemed like they were having fun .
really disappointed in sapphire and i 'll be hard pressed to go back .
this is supposedly the biggest strip club in vegas .
coming into this club at 1am , there were just way to many people .
lot 's of people standing around because all the seats were taken .
but i guess they reserve tables for groups who do the bottle service .
bottles start at $ _num_ and can go up as high as $ _num_ .
and speaking of lap dances , they 're $ _num_ per song .
a disappointing money vacuum .
drinks and table service are some of the most expensive in las vegas .
zero stars if i could .
i hope that my girl finds a new club to dance at .
very low class and upsetting .
zero stars .
so once you get inside , then you run into problems .
some were downright scary ... was it ugly girls night at the sapphire ?
the place , was just , too crowded for me .
that 's way too expensive .
she looked pretty pissed off .
god , i hate establishments like this .
- our booth was a bit cramped , esp for _num_ guys .
some of the girls that tried to offer lap dances were even worse .
see how annoying that is ?
horrible management !
now keep in mind , they refused bottle service somewhere along the way .
this is absolutely the worst gentlemen s club i ever been too !
very disappointed !
do n't waste your money or time here !
i will never return to this place.
for whatever reason , we chose sapphire .
firstly , there was along wait to get in .
the most disappointing thing about this club , the strippers were pretty hefty .
also , there was nowhere to sit .
stupid place , ugly strippers .
not impressed .
wtf ?
awful place to go !
terrible management , overpriced and the girls were n't very impressive .
crazy horse is where it 's at !
we just walked in and had n't even figured out where to sit .
no big deal .
no big deal again .
drinks were decent , the tickets only cover wells .
the next drinks went up in price .
paid $ _num_ for _num_ bottles of water ... normal price ?
lots of hot women here , we spent some time with a few .
we also met some that were very pushy and borderline rude when you declined .
some ladies just acted like they did n't want to be there .
did eventually find a few hot ladies to end the night with .
this is the worst club i have ever seen .
avoid this place .
by far the worst gentleman 's club i 've been to in vegas !
big mistake .
seemed awkward to us .
needless to say we were done .
if anything they 've just experienced the worst of the worst .
they will try and run your card for money .
they do n't collect until you enter into the premises .
i will not be back .
worse strip club i 've been too .
so we sat down .
tossed the reserved sign and no one said a word .
fine here is $ _num_ dollars now just go away .
we did n't get mad just said with smile that we were done .
no more .
no that was n't enough of a tip !
this place is a total rip off .
the drinks are over priced .
after spending almost a $ _num_ on drinks all we did was stand around .
not to mention the crowd was barely talented .
totally low class service for high dollar prices .
take my advice take your business elsewhere .
horrible !
the worst !
girls did n't even dance on the pole , they just walked around .
and $ _num_ for the cover .
this place is a ripoff .
they promised my a free pickup and a $ _num_ entry .
after waiting for _num_ minutes , nobody came .
that was the most expensive diet coke i ever had .
the girls will try to get you to the vip room .
once they start , it really gets annoying !
every girls tries to rip you off somehow .
almost all seats are reserved , but empty .
you stay around like a fool , not knowing where to sit .
this place is bad choice , if you want to have some good time .
my guess is , the kind who likes to get ripped off .
did the limo was free so we tipped the driver and got admission ticket .
when we go inside front desk said its $ _num_ .
no drink ticket .
drinks were $ _num_ and water was $ _num_ .
it 's mandatory to pay $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .
this was by far the worst strip club that i have ever been to !
the dancers did n't have much personality and were over the top fake .
first off , my wife and i purchased a couples package .
we got there and were treated like scum because we prepaid .
the waitress was horrible and came by maybe once every hour .
we ended up getting _num_ beers each the entire time we were there .
then they would come and bug me for a dance .
that is the only good part of our entire time at this place .
in my opinion this place is not couples friendly at all .
spent $ _num_ for two to walk in .
if i could rate her service i would give it a _num_ .
the club gets a negative _num_ hence the two .
not my fault who the door goes too .
all i ask is you assume the money i spend is important .
do n't waste your time or money .
it was a rip off !
to many other clubs to spend your money and be treated like a customer .
horrible money hungry girls .
crazy horse _num_ is better !
i would give it zero stars if possible .
otherwise , avoid this ghetto as fuck club at all costs !
seriously , fuck this place .
atm 's charge $ _num_ for a cash advance !
do not use your card .
i used my card once and i have _num_ charges on it .
i did not like it here .
one dancer in particular on stage was awful .
worst strip club i 've even been to .
was in vegas past weekend of my boy 's bachelor party .
sadly , they were much better than the actual strippers in sapphire .
no bueno on that .
so she got lost when we told her to please leave us alone .
no where else to sit in the club , only standing room .
so we said forget this and left the club .
pretty much ruined the part of his party .
luckily he said everything else more than made up for this crappy place .
basically a giant tourist trap and a scam .
the biggest strip club in the us is also the worst in the us .
this place sucks in every possible way .
then i called sapphire direct and told the girl my situation .
she was less then helpful and had a super rude unpleasant attitude .
i was here on july _num_ , _num_ to watch ufc _num_ .
turns out , not one of them had a clue what was going on .
girls are not that attractive , drinks are very expensive .
i had my worst experience here .
worst place in vegas .
the manager `` steel '' is very rude .
the staff is rude .
drinks are watered down .
the girls are on the ugly side .
the worst experience ever !
the staff here needs more training on customer service and how to treat women !
this whole experience was completely embarrassing and a waste of time !
this place is nothing but shit hole !
however , we met sam the limo driver and he was pretty cool .
all employees looked tired and/or bored .
then wait for $ _num_ drinks ?
horrible !
_num_ thumbs down for this spot .
worst experience in vegas .
waitress charge you way more than they should and strippers lie to you .
the most racist strip club on the planet .
i get the limo deal for the _num_ drinks minimum cover for $ _num_ .
limo picks me and my friend up by mgm no problem .
but do n't take my word for it .
this place sucks .
yes it 's big , but also empty .
most of the girls are n't even that hot .
$ _num_ just to use the atm .
then from there girls immediately come to you and sit on your lap .
not have some random girl sit on me .
then we said no thanks but they would n't let us leave .
overall worst experience i 've had at a club .
i do n't mind them trying to hustle me for drinks .
over all i will not go back .
i am sure that this is how they get their ratings .
well we fell for it .
each drink is $ _num_ so we only got one each !
like i came ready to spend money .
it was boring .
do n't waste your time and money .
it took _num_ waitresses and _num_ minutes to get two beers .
terrible customer service there .
typical stuck up blonde vegas chick .
do n't listen to the hype it 's not that great at all .
it was $ _num_ to get in ( friday night ) .
words can not express the bs i 've just experienced .
this place exists to suck the most money out of your pocket as possible .
if you are stupid .
this whole place is a scam designed to take your money .
avoid this place at all costs .
we spent hours here .
horrible customer service !
we are left confused , wondering why and where she left to lol .
this guy really needs to take a course in management and customer service .
we will not be coming here again .
what a total rip-off !
i wasted my time and money for lies !
another promise broken as we were invited to have sex with ourselves .
biggest rip-off is a better term .
terrible !
i would not recommend this club to my worst enemy .
_num_ stars if that were possible .
my experience was similar to everyone else 's who had a bad experience .
it will be a waste of time and aggravation .
worst strip club ever .
however , two asian strippers came down to my friends and started to dance .
i paid them $ _num_ per person and they danced for about a minute .
it was too rude .
they would n't stop until they get all your cash .
i can only say , ripped off .
not going to bring any of my friends here again .
it is not a good spot for local people .
please dont waste your money .
in vegas , for _num_ days thought i would give this place a shot .
that was a mistake .
hardly no girls .
the only reason for _num_ stars .
place was dead .
the waiters ca n't even say hi , or make eye contact .
if you are in vegas , dont waste your money here .
_num_ dollar entry fee and the drinks are _num_ bucks .
the average dancer age was around _num_ .
this place treats their customers like garbage !
people were rude still .
cover was _num_ and it is not okay inside .
i repeat ... not okay .
if you are a tourist you get stuck with the $ _num_ cover .
no problem , i do well enough that i will not bitch about that .
not good since i like to drink when i 'm out .
apparently they are the locals and door man 's favorites .
none of them were better than a _num_ !
the only _num_ pretty girls i saw where walking around the floor .
maybe the owners should get better management to hire `` pretty girls .
not old chicks with back fat hanging from their bra 's .
i have been an avid patron of the pole arts for many years .
for a total of : you guessed it , $ _num_ .
we paid , left almost no tip and wo n't ever be coming back .
only giving one star because i have to .
horrible and shady are words that come to mind .
we get in , they charge $ _num_ each for the two drinks .
not cool .
it was a monday so half the club was closed down .
$ _num_ for a small bottle water .
majority of the people that gave sapphire _num_ stars are employees .
all they want is your money .
do n't waste your time or hard earned money .
seats are hard to come by unless u buy a table .
they give u _num_ drinks with entry but it 's well drinks .
the staff is very rude !
no variety and some ok many not !
girl in the front gave attitude like she owned the place .
she said they could do _num_ for _num_ drinks .
are you serious ?
worst strip club experience ever .
it cost me $ _num_ to get in .
lazy girls and expensive cocktails .
this way she 's not wasting her time trying to convince me .
i do n't care for drama .
nowhere to sit , the staff is rude .
worst experience ever .
this place is a complete rip-off .
instead every step of the way we felt like we were getting ripped off .
worst experience ever and never going back .
i seriously hate any strip club that charges women to get in .
bad marketing .
the only thing that was n't a rip off , were the lap dances .
the girls on stage were consistently awful .
so we pull out another card , which is my debit card .
makes no sense .
so , we pull out another card and use this one , finally .
are you kidding me ?
rude rude rude staff .
i will never step foot in here again .
we left our china doll and went back to have our own party .
do n't recommend !
waitress told me to leave my seat and go sit elsewhere .
said she was not making any tips because i was not buying enough drinks .
total rip off .
atm charges $ _num_ for taking out $ _num_ .
$ _num_ entry fee wtf !
$ _num_ small water bottle $ _num_ beer .
it was amateur night ... ?
ugh .
started a tab -- -- huge mistake .
all three have yet to fall off ... its been four days .
that was super cool , i 'm on vacation .
further , i paid cash for my $ _num_ tab ... so .
so , zero help there .
this is thee worst strip club i have gone to .
dont waste your money here .
go to the next club , trust me its not worth it .
this is the worst strip club in vegas .
me and my wife finished our extremely overpriced drinks and left .
this is the worst strip club ever .
$ _num_ cover ; $ _num_ rail drinks .
everyone is miserable .
does n't even deserve a _num_ star .
should n't have gone this time .
be prepared to spend money to have a good time here .
we stayed only a short time just from being irritated at the hidden costs .
the stage was small and the pole was short .
rude staff , bartenders .
the lap dances were n't that great either honestly .
i wish there are zero star .
this place just sucks .
terrible .
our limo driver said he 'd get us in for `` free '' .
did n't know free meant a _num_ drink minimum at _num_ bucks per drink .
we were originally not set for a strip joint tonight .
it was a sunday , so only half of the stage is opened .
well that was stupid .
first thing i sat down and tried to let her do her pitch .
yes , the driver apparently is avoiding our calls now .
this place is extremely racist !
but i lost it .
they had absolutely no reason to turn him down .
$ _num_ per person , men and women .
_num_ if your pockets are deep .
first : buying rounds with a credit card or debit ?
huge mistake !
i repeat , do n't open a tab .
your cc will get flagged for suspicious activity .
they bang your card for every round .
which i get but man sapphire is one dirty run business .
the atm fees are sneaky .
if you do n't read the fees you 're a dumb ass .
the fees varied from $ 10-15 .
then you will get an additional $ _num_ fee from your bank .
my dancer was a bad ass european chick so i just kept at it .
long and short , pay the dancers cash .
this place was a total rip off and super super crowded .
club treated me very bad .
i left throwing $ _num_ for the asshole .
more of a scam than a club .
not recommended .
is this it ?
of course no , you have to stand up all night at the bar !
but i 'll let you judge if it worth _num_ dollars or not .
the cover fee was _num_ $ .
( most of ) the girls are n't friendly .
me being a local from las vegas on a wednesday they denied me .
the security who sees me on a regular was surprise too .
i wished i tried to go in first before they had paid .
very disappointed .
i do n't think i 'll bring my friends here again .
wo n't let _num_ hot girls in to the club without a guy ?
maybe in las vegas that flies .
i could care less about $ _num_ per person .
also , i would n't walk it alone at night .
the system here is backwards .
there are rules in place that are not written down anywhere .
no drinks by the pool , this rule is no where to be found .
this place is a mess .
lived here a year and there was all kinds of ridiculous shit going on .
it 's completely absurd .
do n't be sucked in by these crooks .
if i could give them a negative rating - i would .
_num_ star is too high .
worst place to live .
ac problems all the time and the toilets are always clogged .
at the end of the day management will blame you for your loss .
plus : close to strip , pool , big hot tub , underground parking .
police on property weekly it seems like .
why am i staying : lease .
yes they changed their uniforms , but their performance leaves much to be desired .
they do not follow up on this .
i was not greeted .
he said no , and turned his attention to other customers .
ultimately i was n't interested in making a purchase from the experience i had .
i tried to order a dress with this store but never again .
ridiculous .
i walked out .
i asked fifty time for help did i get it no .
practically , it does n't change anything though .
if you have chinese food , you have it in the chinese restaurant .
a very dark place , with no windows and little or no decorations .
we went for lunch , and the place was relatively busy .
then , another full _num_ minutes to come back .
did n't taste like anything really .
another full _num_ minutes and we got our entrees .
the kung po chicken one of the worst i 've ever had .
heck , all the recipes i 've tried at home were better .
the chicken was fine , but there were almost no vegetables .
it was just a very very blend dish .
the shrimp and vegetables meal was average .
there were plenty of vegetables in it , which was good .
the sauce was a thick white sauce that was more or less flavorless .
in the end , we were very dissapointed .
anyway , that is why i made my feelings known up front .
rude as fuck !
um excuse me ?
rude asians with no manners and apparently no business knowledge .
their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush .
not my kind of chinese food , all dishes over sauced .
won ton soup broth thin on flavor .
i was told this was the `` best chinese food in las vegas '' .
i went to try after several referrals , i decided to try .
the food was tasteless and slimy .
would not walk around here alone at night for a minute .
ok i agree w/ sean g. here ... friendly people at the front desk .
anyway ... lets get _num_ da real deal ... motel _num_ rooms !
to be honest , i never stayed at this motel _num_ .
i did , however , drive into the parking lot .
_num_ i arrived at the hotel .
_num_ i refused to pay them , and i started getting angry .
_num_ score ?
just wait until i write corporate a letter .
this is just the beginning of my list .
not the worst thing to ever happen but definitely not something i ever expected .
did n't care for it !
holy crap , that did n't happen .
i spent as little time as possible in the room .
did n't seem surprised at all .
the front desk staff was no help .
i was staying there from september _num_ , _num_ through september _num_ , _num_ .
called bad timing huh ?
i do n't like the respect and care they have for customers .
two worst places put right next to each other .
i call it a garbage dump .
it was a terrible experience .
perhaps some kind of drug ring or something ?
worst place ever .
horrible customer service .
horrible experience .
but its too bad i will never stay there again .
they told me that i have to wait till 6am in the morning .
terrible service .
there were no other rooms available so i had to stick it through .
my husband has been staying for work for _num_ weeks now .
he works night and would sleep most of the day .
could n't the person who made the reservation tell him over the phone .
i personally would never stay there , my husband had no choice .
i would avoid this hotel .
not even worth a star .
we are not coming back what so ever .
not even worth it .
i do n't even know where to start .
i had a horrible experience and checked out the same day i checked in !
i 'll keep this as short as possible .
i got a bite on by butt !
it was a few rooms down from where our room was at .
not sure what was going on , but i know it was n't good .
i wished i booked our second night there .
never again .
there are some sketchy characters wandering around this area .
there were bed bugs ... gross .
i was supposed to stay _num_ nights , but i checked out after _num_ .
my boyfriend and i are from los angeles ca .
as we ventured further in the room i looked and the toilet was dirty .
i tried to flush it but i guess it was stuck .
we called the front desk again they said they would have someone come clean .
the next day we leave and stay gone till its dark .
room _num_ .
a non-smoking room ; that 's a lie .
the cooler from the wall was broken but still blowing cold air .
it was n't my hair .
this place was horrible .
hell no !
over my dead body even it was dirt cheap .
nasty .
i do n't know if it 's new management or not .
some rooms smell like toilet .
perfect cheap place to just get some sleep if you 're alone .
weekday rates was something like $ _num_ total .
pretty false advertisement !
rooms are not nice in person , and service sucks .
called he manager and nothing was done .
place is a total dump .
i really wish i could give it less stars .
the young man who checked me in did n't bother to respond .
i went back downstairs and complained .
he said that room was not being worked on this week .
there is constant noise .
i can not even relax in my own room .
this place is just awful .
stayed here to get a two bedroom because our college age kiddos with us .
there were mattresses and furniture piled up along the side of the building .
the pool is no frills and has no sun for half of the day .
i wo n't be back and will not recommend it to anyone .
stayed here to get a two bedroom because our college age kiddos with us .
there were mattresses and furniture piled up along the side of the building .
the pool is no frills and has no sun for half of the day .
i wo n't be back and will not recommend it to anyone .
first thing i noticed when entering the room was its odd odor .
no tub , only shower .
bed was large but not a pillow top and looked well used .
awful unprofessional staff .
they said this place was packed , but we never had trouble finding parking .
the room was old and outdated , but clean .
honestly the worst experience ever .
are you kidding i do n't think so .
they will try to charge you at the end of your stay for anything .
horrible horrible place ... .
this place made my stay in vegas not pleasant !
no transportation offered to get to strip !
once loyal customer .
their effort blatantly did not match their results .
instead of treating people as just another dollar .
i would definitely not recommended this place .
they rush everyone so they can make another dollar .
if the bride or groom was n't there they would proceed on .
disappointing .
the rice was also mushy , and the meat was tasteless .
this is probably the worst chipotle i 've ever been to .
this dump does not even deserve _num_ star !
this left a small 1/2 inch by _num_ inch exposed area on the burrito .
soooo gross .
corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime .
sorry for the inconvenience chipotle .
probably one of the worst chipotle locations that i have visited .
the food did n't taste as fresh as it could have been either .
you 've been warned !
alas tonight was a total let down !
i took a bite and was totally sad .
this one was a sad excuse !
this is hands down the worst experience i have ever had at a chipotle .
also , there is no real character to the location .
i 've gotten through chipotle lines _num_ times as long in less time .
this location was particularly bad about this .
half the time they did n't know how to say something in english .
such a disappointment .
like what the hell was that am i supposed to do it .
smh lazy people .
five star for the food .
_num_ star for the service .
this place needs some management to get these guys moving .
i brought my husband there about a month ago and it was gross .
we got beef items and every bite had gristle and fat .
on top of that line was still slow and staff was very unfriendly .
place was pretty messy too .
i will not go back , especially not to this location , especially now .
the portions were really small here .
my chips were very stale .
do not eat here !
would highly recommend avoiding any chipotle at this time .
i feel like death warmed over .
disappointed !
staying in this hotel while it is in construction sucks .
price of the room was very reasonable .
kitchenette is equipped with plates , silverware , electric stove and refrigerator .
there is no ice maker on hotel premises .
i like the hotel towels ; they are thick .
the downfall for me is the room had an odor .
normally i would have given this hotel _num_ stars .
every time i to deal with her was unpleasant .
she was never friendly and never smiled .
that said , the other employees were all kind and helpful .
they gave a room key out to my room .
a true dump !
she acts like it 's my fault !
no apology , no smiles , what a bitch !
they could n't find it in their hearts to let me pee .
la quinta next door was so much more welcoming and way nicer inside .
nachos were okay , if you like cheese whiz .
horrible service .
place was dead .
did not even honor my coupon .
the manager did not even bother to come out .
taco bell is more mexican than this place .
meat was cold .
rip off !
but do n't order the chips it will disappoint you .
the only thing giving this place _num_ stars was its sanitation ... very clean .
other than that , my family will never eat here again .
horrible food !
soggy chimichanga ... .
easily the worst meal i had on my _num_ day trip around america !
most mexican places use refried beans .
this was the worst mexican food my husband and i have ever had .
i would just describe them as cardboard .
needless to say , we were sorely disappointed by the entire experience !
over priced and needs some seasoning .
if you want some good food , go elsewhere , like the pizzeria .
if you want really good food , leave the parking lot .
good food but horrible service .
they 're slow and unorganized .
but the service is not about the customer .
i 'd skip it .
i 'd take taco bell any day of the week .
food was bad , made my son sick all night .
everyone claimed the food was the worst mexican food they had eaten .
the staff were great but sadly the food was n't .
the chicken did n't have any flavor and had a lot water in it .
just horrible !
the pico de gallo was the only thing i actually liked in the bowl .
the chicken was dry .
the beans were clearly from a can and the rice was completely lacking flavor .
they were full of fat chunks and looked disgusting .
not a nice big bowl of it .
barely larger than the cups they give you at pollo loco for salsa .
you 're better off at taco bell !
i would n't really care to go back .
was the worse mexican food i 've had in vegas .
the soup was tasteless .
i dont think anything is made fresh here .
do n't waste your money here .
i ordered the deluxe nachos and the cheese was not even melted .
false advertising !
the staff seemed rushed and careless .
the tables and floors were dirty .
for the price , i was expecting the food to be much better .
i bought a carne asada burrito and it was disgusting .
the flour tortilla was a cross between cardboard and turtle shell .
ok , enough compliments ... avoid unless it 's your last option .
this place has horrible service .
these were the worst nachos i had ever ate .
the cheese was not melted all the way .
i also ordered tacos and they were n't very good either .
this is not the best mexican restaurant and i do not recommend this place .
long ass review sum : do not eat here .
unless you want food poisoning .
first of all the selections at circus circus are minimal .
literally stood in line for _num_ minutes .
not worth it at all .
i only ate a few bites .
bf said he would n't eat it again though .
my daughter took a bite and spit it out and said it was disgusting .
my son ( _num_ ) took a bite and said it was fish .
bf tried it and spit it out and said the chicken is old .
i smelled it and omg it smelled disgusting .
we felt so bad for giving it to our kids .
please avoid this place like the plague .
worst service ever !
the stupid girl at the register put through all _num_ of our orders incorrectly .
worst customer service !
its not that hard to key in a quesadilla !
nothing express about this place .
ridiculous .
this place is way over priced !
most def never again !
the pictures they post throughout the hotel is very misleading .
terrible !
do n't waste your time .
what mexican restaurant runs out of sour cream ?
oh wait , the guy seated next to me and he had sour cream .
the food was on the cold side and not all that good .
what a disappointment .
they were stingy on the cheese , it was cold , dried .
i had two bites , pushed the plate aside .
needless to say he finished his burrito .
i also ordered _num_ carne asada $ _num_ , steep if you ask me .
avoid this place at all costs !
each time , the quality is the same and prices may vary slightly .
i must say m & s disappointed me on this occasion .
and no , we wo n't be ordering that thanks .
mediocre , true definition of _num_ stars .
the food was alright .
came here the other night for dinner since i was craving fish .
i waited over _num_ minutes to be seated .
crab soup was horrible ... no taste .
management and customer service was horrible with compensation for bad service .
i wo n't be back .
floor in the entry could have used a vacuum .
i probably will not return .
bland !
waited _num_ mins before the supposedly delish sourdough bread to come out .
unfortunately , that basket of bread was cold .
_num_ . )
wrong !
_num_ . )
complete waste of money .
c. tempura snapper ( fresh catch of the day ) : snapper was overcooked .
bad food , poor customer service , not coming back !
i do n't handle change well .
now your choice of happy hour beer is no choice .
it 's $ _num_ , and comes in a small glass .
no more sangria , or the cocktail of the day .
she also said regular customers were very unhappy .
no surprise there .
the server was annoyed ... it was written all over his face .
the _num_ green beans were great ... thanks big guy .
you do not get to choose your sides .
not that the sides were much to choose from .
their was hardly any sauce on the plate .
not worth the $ _num_ a plate .
i 'm just so so so disappointed .
do n't go to this place the price is not worth it .
unfortunately things have changed .
the last _num_ times i 've been , it has been horrible .
when she arrived , she was very indifferent .
of course , i had to search again for someone to bring a bill .
the special does not come with anything , except for a tomato .
he never returned during our dinner so that we could ask what happened .
we were shocked and insulted , since we had already finished our meals .
meanwhile my drink came , tasty but hardly any booze and loaded with ice .
the steak looked good but was chewy and lacked any beef flavor .
the service was hit and miss .
m & s was a bust for me , an overpriced meal lacking flavor .
but the food was mediocre .
save your money and avoid disappointment and go somewhere else .
we ordered _num_ bottles of wine before we picked one they had !
that process dragged out too long .
just so so , with a bland broth .
i had over _num_ $ in gift cards .
i gave them away .
she will never go there again .
his treatment of the servers was hard to watch .
never been to a m & s since .
no more fresh juice .
oysters where lousy even though this is the season .
dinning was lousy .
he was rude when asked , where the previous manger was .
i ordered fish & chips the fish was nasty and smelled lousy .
it sure was not cod or halibut .
to many good fish houses in las vegas to put up with this crap .
friday night _num_ three tables being used , no one in the bar .
it was all presentation and no taste .
lobster bisque was lacking in taste .
we wo n't waste our money here again .
drinks were fine , we were not offered bread .
it was a charred , hard knot .
hmmm , nothing about not making it right but blame the customer ?
we will not be going back .
furthermore , their computer was down , i could n't redeem my birthday points .
if it was possible to give zero stars i would have done it !
they ca n't even get your steak right the way you want it .
i refused it .
worst thing about it was that i was starving to eat dinner .
this restaurant is no exception .
the wait time was ridiculous considering there were many open tables .
what poor standards this location must have .
poor management at this location .
i would not recommend this location to anyone .
i would say it 's a must order , if you like carpaccio .
but do not order the happy hour ahi .
it must have been triple salted on the crust .
i had to spit it out , it was so terrible .
gave it a shot but i doubt i 'll be back here .
the service was sub par and the food was not worth the price .
i had the sizzling fish tacos that consisted of overcooked tilapia and flavorless veggies .
i did not get a refill on my ice tea the entire visit .
overall overpriced average food and poor service .
not a place i will return to .
first trip : sat at bar area never got the waitress .
left without service and told manager i would not return .
although nice , our server was extremely slow .
it took at least _num_ more minutes for our original server to come back .
my boyfriend 's old fashioned tasted weird .
our crab cake was lukewarm .
i 'm not impressed for the price .
prices make up for terrible service .
slow .
amateur hour .
we enjoy this chain but this particular one is worse than awful .
staff did n't seem to care if they serve good food or not .
overpriced $ $ $ $ the mussels were fishy tasting , not fresh .
we were excited to try this place for the first time .
we both ordered fish & chips and what a disappointment .
the ambiance was nice and so was the waiter but the food was awful .
it also had a weird taste as if it was n't fresh .
you 'll only get three small grilled shrimps and three small stuff shrimp .
in sum , i have n't been impressed with m & c .
not at all up to par .
will not be returning .
this was not the place .
that was _num_ minutes .
our salad came along with _num_ thin slices of bread .
felt a little rushed .
waiter put our food down and disappeared .
not , i 'm so sorry , please try us again .
the funny thing is this was sunday evening and the restaurant was practically empty .
why was our service so poor ?
everything was too salty .
had lobster bisque that was so thick it was needing a fork and knife .
even fries were too salty .
that 's hard to do because i like salty fries .
was n't that impressed with this place .
the sauted mushroom and spinach had no flavor .
not worth the price .
they refilled our drinks before they were done and salads were amazing .
everyone 's food was undercooked , even the guests that had chicken .
our server at lunchtime was attentive .
we went here for my daughters 21st birthday dinner , and it was horrible .
worst experience ever , and a waste of my hard earned money .
the restaurant was not terribly busy when we arrived .
a woman cleared the dirty plates away , then disappeared .
i know this towel is not sanitary .
anyway , that was all the cleaning we received .
a few minutes later or drinks were delivered and orders taken .
after about _num_ minutes or food was delivered .
she did not mention any charge .
when the check arrived or bill was $ _num_ .
dessert was $ _num_ .
each glass was $ _num_ !
i will never dine in one of your restaurants again .
the only good thing about this place was the food .
otherwise terrible service , waiters and management that makes you feel unwelcome here .
because of it it 's not worth your money .
i guess they 're not very interested in keeping their clients .
there are a lot of things to hate about this place .
usually i really like them , but this one was terrible .
they admitted having messed up but did n't provide any decent compensation .
_num_ ) the iron was broken .
_num_ ) i had same day laundry service that was n't delivered on time .
none of them worked .
i stay a a westin or w at least _num_ nights a week .
i know these places ... the service sucked .
freaking annoying .
i was n't impressed by this hotel .
it was a disaster !
this place is pathetic !
maybe others have had a more pleasant stay but ours was a nightmare .
unfortunately the action is dead after midnight over there .
but a bit more beat up then a typical westin .
i mean , who goes to vegas to stay at the westin ?
someone came into the room while i was sleeping and stole my wallet .
this is the worst hotel in vegas .
my last stay was absolutely terrible .
i went back to the front desk and asked for another room .
and they said i would have to wait again .
instead of a westin , it was more like a best western .
they offered no way to tune it out .
the hotel was also oddly less than pristine .
the room was musty when i first walked in .
the chicken entree i ordered was terrible .
no slip under my door , no phone call .
i 'm really torn about this review for this hotel .
after we flew back home to ca , i immediately researched more .
valet parking is under the direct sizzling vegas sun !
i could have parked it myself ... without tipping the guy !
even the westin heavenly shower head was broken !
i stayed at this hotel for business recently .
it was overpriced , noisy and not worth being `` off the strip '' .
as for the actual hotel : check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly .
sad anyway !
the lobby is decent , not too loud , not too smoky .
`` and this includes the parking , breakfast , etc ? ''
we let them know this was an error .
nor is breakfast .
none of those apply to the westin las vegas .
this hotel does not deserve the westin name .
resort fees are something new hotels are doing .
they missed on both .
the crap table never opened .
not good for business .
also , please consider your levels of service .
please , westin - staff your concierge desk .
unless you pay attention , expect to go out of business in this location .
no flat screen tvs .
for the westin , this place stinks , literally .
bathrooms no vent .
no weird stains on carpet .
they said they 'd check it out and apologized sincerely .
for comparison , luxor is _num_ 1/2 .
priceline gave us the westin as our winning bid .
horrible !
you get a standard westin room with standard westin amenities .
there is nothing to remind you of the great vegas hotels in this establishment .
nothing super negative but just that i was disappointed to be in another westin .
have n't even gone yet , but already off to a bad start .
why , in this day and age , do vegas hotels charge for internet ?
very poor first impression .
they totally disappointed at this location .
i will never be back .
decor was poor .
tv was old school .
hmmm ... is the westin becoming the holiday inn ?
fine , no big deal .
oh well , too damn bad for them .
i can see why the place was dead with staff like that .
i will probably not stay there again unless i have to .
so i was in vegas over the weekend and i have finally recovered !
i went back up to the room and went back to bed .
looked a little shady .
all the staff was friendly , including the dealers .
here 's the bad .
also , they had very thin walls .
finally , your options for gambling are quite limited .
in the morning i only saw some black jack tables open .
all tables were open by the early evening though .
it is only about _num_ blocks off the strip , near bally 's .
was beyond disappointed .
do not stay here .
you can do better anywhere else .
i do not recommend the hotel restaurant .
as many other yelpers said , the bed was very comfortable .
it 's like an apartment charging you pet rent .
it makes no sense .
i ca n't quite figure that one out .
the restaurant is _num_ hours as well .
temp does n't change .
, limited additional facilities .
still , i 'd stay somewhere else ( venetian , wynn , etc .
so far crap !
ca n't check-in until _num_ unless we want a full bed .
said needed to wait another _num_ minutes .
smells like smoke in the empty lobby where they are supposedly full !
but once we got there we were totally disappointed !
really got ta take the westin name off this place .
it feels like a days inn .
tube tvs are way out of date .
lobby is smokey ( but this is vegas , baby ) .
no big casino .
the rooms are very dated and the views , nonexistent .
on the plus side , the beds are comfy .
very annoying .
for what we paid , we would not stay here again .
disappointing overall .
this property does not live up to sheraton standards let alone westin standards .
this ca n't be a corporate property .
beware of hidden mandatory fees .
this is the only westin that charges mandatory service fee .
so do not pay more and stay at this hotel .
las vegas is not like other us cities .
in las vegas , no one charges for parking !
why is westin charging this fee ?
this place smells like ass .
was told pool hours and on 2nd rooftop , only to be under construction .
do n't bother staying here .
looking out the window we could only see construction and it was noisy .
bad stay .
you will not get it here .
the carpet is worn over and the air did not work very well .
i just could n't get past how worn the room seemed .
i am five foot five inches .
as stated before this is not for the vegas experience .
in fact , i did n't and i was with someone .
beware of hidden mandatory fees .
this is the only westin that charges mandatory service fee .
so do not pay more and stay at this hotel .
las vegas is not like other us cities .
in las vegas , no one charges for parking !
why is westin charging this fee ?
it was ok but i did n't think it was worth the $ _num_ .
they only provided _num_ tiny containers of syrup but a large pat of butter .
however , my credit card had already been charged for the room ... .
the manager samantha 's response was `` sorry , nothing we can do . ''
this was exactly what i 'd originally asked for .
i will never stay at the westin las vegas again .
worst customer service experience ever and i travel a lot !
they steal from me then tell me it 's my own fault .
i looked at the sheets and they appeared dirty to me .
i could not wait to leave .
how is this not criminal deceptive advertising practices ?
what a horrible horrible joke .
stayed here just this past weekend for two nights .
i have never had any of these things happen in other hotels .
she was extremely unethical and misleading .
overall i was very disappointed by this hotel .
staff did n't really seem to care about anything .
( the mini fridge was empty .
and the store downstairs was out of all juices except apple . )
i would not stay here again .
the sheets were so worn it was like sleeping in sand paper .
not worth the points !
not joking .
walked into our room and it was _num_ degrees .
but it was _num_ degrees outside .
ugh .
horrible .
customer service is where it gets bad .
you had been my go-to chain so far in my travels .
the stay was terrible !
did n't think too much of it .
i was n't able to sleep both nights i was there .
it was pure hell .
all they offered was to reverse one of the amenities charges .
they actually blamed me for not telling them the first night .
i was so tired the next day .
worst hotel stay ever .
but nevertheless for experienced craps players this is a terrible place to play .
the dealers are inattentive and screw up frequently .
terrible customer service .
the new ones are hard to moderate .
much better hotels available in same price range .
to start there is only one restaurant with a limited menu .
the room is spacious though it 's decor could use a huge facelift .
my room seems dingy although not obviously unclean .
not off white .
and their hvac could probably use some repair .
mostly , it 's pretty standard as far as hotels rooms go .
there 's no `` wow '' whatsoever .
they do have a _num_ hr starbucks and a spa which is nice .
hopefully , i 'll get to check them out later .
as a guest and a woman , i do n't feel safe .
that 's not acceptable .
terrible experience .
they 're being ridiculous .
rude staff .
pool area is a really sad place .
drinks ridiculously overpriced .
westin paris and other westin properties .
they could have done better .
worn out .
terrible room service .
casino has zero vibe .
thats all nothing more just the beds .
horrible house keeping .
but because it is off the strip , there is less foot traffic here .
the person who checked me in did n't acknowledge any of my requests .
the only request they did accommodate was the one away from the elevator .
stayed here two months ago on a get away for my anniversary .
but that was not the case , i was that _num_ % .
wo n't be back .
i wish that cosmo had another night avail .
no comparison .
long walk to the strip as well .
wish i could leave negative stars .
the westin las vegas sucks !
the girl was so rude .
horrible customer service and no attempt to solve the problem .
if i could give zero , or negative stars , i would .
it does n't work at all .
this happened every single time , and is 10-15 minute process .
gm wo n't take time to address .
this hotel is the worst westin we have ever stayed in .
it is very old and rundown .
layers of dust and dirt all around the edges of the room and furniture .
seems like a quick turn to get rooms turned over .
struggled to get air flow in the room .
had a horrible time sleeping at night .
tv was not working well .
my husband and i split the turkey and egg tacos .
i do not recommend this hotel and will not return .
so disappointing !
but there 's a reason why the westin has some terrible reviews .
there 's a small casino with a few tables and a mediocre restaurant .
not bad , but we had to go elsewhere for all our entertainment .
the service desk was apologetic , so points to them .
- there was no hot water in the shower on our first day .
when i called front desk about this , they were very unhelpful .
i hate giving bad reviews , but avoid this place if you can .
overall , it would be difficult for me to recommend this hotel again .
completely disappointing stay and property especially for a westin .
very poor planning .
no follow up from staff and was treated like i was an inconvenience .
ca n't sleep .
luckily for the hotel , my boss books the hotel .
very frustrating when customer service is non existent .
customer service is awful .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
the dealer at the blackjack table had no personality .
lastly , we woke up to take showers and no hot water .
large hidden resort fee of $ _num_ per day .
i had the worst experience ever in a las vegas hotel !
as i get to the bar , nobody takes my order .
so i politely asked if i could speak to security .
lame .
forced to stay here for a work function .
skip this place at all costs !
i will not ever stay here again ( after this first stay ) .
payed twice what i should have for half of the experience .
overall , i would say that this stay was not quite what i expected .
is your comment simply to satisfy social media or are you sincere ?
not impressed .
however , the hotel itself could really use some upgrades .
the rooms were very dated .
i 'm very disappointed with this hotel .
i stayed here recently and upon check in i had requested no service .
this place is going downhill fast !
time to remodel and get current as this place is close to _num_ star .
terrible at the front desk .
breakfast was gross and quite a disaster .
no fresh fruit and high buck .
could have gone to breakfast at bellagio ( same price !
dont waste your time , especially on slots .
definitely not a _num_ star let alone a _num_ star !
terrible !
here on a layover as an airline employee .
not at the westin las vegas .
so my wife and i came to vegas for our _num_ year anniversary .
we woke up to bed bug bites and bed bugs on our bed .
worst part is the manager `` samantha '' did not do anything about it .
worst management ever .
also stains all over the carpet in the room , elevator looks super ghetto .
for me the hotel was quiet and the staff was friendly .
the hotel is located off the strip and next to a gas station .
this seems to be a hang out with homeless type folks .
do not go to this hotel you are wasting your money .
filthy and all around disgusting .
worst taco ever .
chili cheese fries sucked !
on the strip .
no way it was steak !
wrong .
del taco , mexican for `` trash . ''
and taco bell is not good either .
avoid avoid avoid !
so , this is probably the worst nordstrom i have ever been too .
it is not because of lack of product or prices .
in the past five years , the las vegas nordstrom has declined tremendously !
i was ignored , made to wait , and wait some more .
disgusted i asked to speak to the floor manager on call that night .
piss me off and your bottom line will suffer .
nordstrom is always where i buy my good clothes from , among other things .
i purchased a st. john outfit at full price of $ _num_ .
totally , totally , disappointed .
because i refuse to believe the rest of the nordstrom family is this way .
went in tonight to purchase two pairs of shoes .
unfortunately no one came to my assistance .
perhaps if i were purchasing women 's shoes i would have received better service .
rude !
the valet here is extremely rude .
this is the second bad experience i have had with valet .
well it happened at this nordstrom and it is annoying .
good thing their mens clothes are not that great anyways .
truly disappointed in service and quality .
at previous visits i have purchased made in usa shorts and shirts .
i 'm not paying $ _num_ for chinese crap .
for that they only get one star .
extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service at this store .
it 's disappointing .
problem is with the alteration department .
really rude .
this is the second nordstrom store that has issues with alteration department .
i will never return back !
i received such horrible customer service at this location .
i feel they do n't care anymore and are just over it .
if you hate your life and your job just quit then .
i 'm so upset and angry at nordstrom at fashion show mall .
worst nordstrom 's experience ever .
this location sucks .
such inattentive employees and rude !
i mean so rude !
they will say they are unable to do it .
women 's shoe department is , during this visit , appalling .
messy , bare , lacking in quality , variety .
terrible .
this is the worst experience i have ever had at any nordstrom !
this is unacceptable and unbelievable .
she also did not attempt to cut my nails .
i took the polish off this morning and my nails look awful .
whatever you do , do not go to this place .
you will be disappointed .
this was my first time at this location though and what a disappointment !
to start , we began with the chopped antipasto salad ( $ _num_ ) .
fried calamari ( $ _num_ ) was the next to arrive .
the pizza was not good , period .
the real disgusting dish was the veal though .
it looked bad and tasted bad .
it was such a waste !
service was okay - not bad , not exceptionally good .
the bread was even worse than that .
do n't plan on going to this place ever again .
overall a very bad experience .
when my food arrived , my eggplant parmesan tasted like charcoal .
in that case , it was a horrible dish !
otherwise ... stop being so cheap buca !
keep your standards even though the economy sucks !
( it was brought by another server ) .
just before dinner arrived another server brought our drinks .
both of them wrong .
i 'm really losing faith .
took almost _num_ minutes just to get our drinks .
might have to find another place for big birthday dinners in the future .
the cardinals offensive line maybe ?
the sauce was very minimal and tons of cheese .
wrong .
if i went back to buca i 'd def .
our _num_ tables were served dinner at different times .
this is not how my family does family style .
i just was n't happy .
i was n't blown away , like i was hoping to be .
i was like `` hell yeah , i 'm there ! ''
food and service are not good .
not much else to say but it was just bad all around .
the food was ok some of the pasta did n't have any flavor .
i would never never ever go there again .
they left a bad taste in my mouth for life !
we had a waiter in training , someone should have trained his trainer .
expressed my dislike for the calamari - only to be ignored .
but will not go back .
all in all , i guess i did n't like their marinara .
surely not an hour for _num_ pieces of chicken .
if i could give it a zero , i would .
oh and the broccoli ?
over priced bad italian food .
i would not recommend this bad experience to anyone .
however , as sad as it is , it can not be avoided .
sadly , it never came .
seating was prompt , the server was not .
yet when our entrees came , there was pasta in it .
could they not have put potatoes on the side ?
not the case for gf items .
the food is n't anything to go crazy over .
saucy , but that 's no big deal .
i am a bread lover , and this was up to my standards .
but , the spaghetti and meatballs were n't good .
the sauce was weird tasting .
the meatball did n't taste good at all .
it seemed too soft for a meatball .
if you like a very strong , sour lemon taste , sure .
but if you do n't , do not order .
i did n't like it .
our party was n't even served salad until _num_ .
once the entrees came , they were barely even warm .
the server barely came by .
i wish we had spent the money elsewhere .
please do n't let them ruin your banquet too .
nothing special .
even the water tasted awful !
sorry buca this was another disappointing visit .
we ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni per suggestions on yelp .
this dish was horrible .
the chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like pasta water .
there was no flavor to it at all .
i was there with _num_ other people and they had the same experience .
this still did not help much but made it somewhat edible .
and the lasagna was mediocre .
our server was great but the food service was very slow .
i discussed this experience with buca and they asked me to try again .
tried some different dishes and this time went to the paradise location .
the ceasar salad was ok .
a waste of money for sure .
the chicken sausage ziti us ladies got .
it was terrible !
no salt .
no nothing .
so once again left there very unsatisfied .
seriously like throwing money away .
do i just have the worst luck ?
terrible .
the only reason to rate it higher is because of the portions .
on top of paying twice as much on the food i wanted to ... .
the actual food it 's self was cold and incredibly mediocre ... .
i could have done it better and cheaper by myself !
to bad i was lazy ... .
free does n't always make the food or the experience better .
nothing special .
the food is inconsistent .
management and servers standing around .
salami on it was yummy , but it was n't anything impressive .
no pasta , no wow factor except the price .
the spaghetti and meatballs was bland and mostly noodles .
and it was $ _num_ .
ridiculous .
we can make better italian food at home for much less money .
i really do n't understand the appeal of this place .
sure , the portions are huge , but the food is generic and bland .
the spaghetti and meatballs were the worst i 've had .
no thanks , not worth it .
seriously , i 've been a server .
it is n't that difficult .
soooo we decided not to eat there and my husband and i left .
if you do n't want my business , i will go elsewhere .
aaa and the server kicked my chair every damn time he walked by .
this place is a complete waste of time and money .
they could n't get their ish together at all .
our entrees came out first ( and were cold ) .
followed by our `` server '' smelling like smoke .
thanks but no thanks .
waste of money .
my wife and i went there saturday night .
most entrees do n't include pasta , you have to order that separate .
one of the pasta dishes was very undercooked .
to give a final comment my experience was negative all around .
very disappointed .
the food was bland , and it made me sad .
do not eat here if you are looking for gluten free .
we spoke with the manager and he was very rude .
not very vegetarian friendly .
extremely disappointed in this experience .
horrible .
the baked ziti was extremely dry , very little sauce .
i know restaurants have off nights but this was extremely disappointing .
it took _num_ minutes to get the food menu and the drink menu .
only come here if you have all the patience in the world .
no way !
we were so crammed into the room that people could n't wait to leave .
it was hot , the service was really slow .
it was a disaster .
i wish i would have known better .
overall it was mediocre food , nothing special about this place .
the service was horrible .
we had a reservation for a large party ( _num_ ) for lunch .
it took _num_ minutes to get our meals !
worst experience ever at this location .
las vegas needs to get it together .
at that point i could n't even hear my family members speaking to me .
i 'm extremely disappointed with this locations restaurant .
downhill from there .
too bad , i had to give them a star !
service was slow !
i will never ever go back to buca for any type of meal .
we arrived for lunch as a party of _num_ to an empty hostess stand .
there was nobody else waiting .
my boyfriend 's chicken was also very obviously reheated .
actually , his whole meal was probably forgotten and then stuck in the microwave .
all the seats , chairs , were so crammed into one another .
the food that was selected by the host of our party was greasy .
e recommend this location .
ridiculous .
food was average .
service is very slow .
one waitress tonight ( friday ) for _num_ tables .
if i was not with friends , we would have left .
the food was awful .
while the service was amazing , the food was eh and expensive .
no doubt that i am an italian snob .
this place is not italian .
there is a charge for bread .
a charge for pasta .
a charge for vegetable .
it was really expensive for eh italian food .
the servers were not friendly .
if you go to this location , ask for nick to be your server .
i sure wish that i had .
it was dried out and was very light on marinara sauce .
this highly disappointing experience was n't entirely our servers fault i admit .
terrible , terrible !
i do n't think this establishment cares .
what was _num_ star in now a _num_ star rating .
service is horrible .
we were sitting near the bar and we had some loud guests .
it was n't even busy , maybe _num_ tables had patrons .
appetizer took over _num_ minutes to arrive and the main course took even longer .
i 've never had service like this at the excalibur location .
the manager was very disappointed when i mentioned this but offered nothing .
i mentioned to him that another table looked disgusted with the slow service .
we just came from dinner there and were extremely disappointed .
this was my first experience at the restaurant and i was far from impressed .
from the get go it was quite shady and unprofessional .
ten minutes after that we got complimentary bread and waters .
it was terrible and we will not go back .
the pasta was not dry and it was very flavorful .
the bits of bacon gave it more taste .
there was no customer service in this restaurant at all .
i also received no help when i was at the take out counter .
their online ordering system also needs more improvement .
overall it was such a disappointing visit .
waiting on the rest of my food is making me sleepy .
our server is nowhere to be found and this place is dead .
and ps , my water has been empty this entire time .
the huge bowl of pasta were painfully spicy .
it was hard to find the shrimp that was hidden in it .
the mashed potatoes came out cold in a hot dish .
i had to get up and get hot peppers oil and vinegar myself .
this is really kind of ridiculous and i doubt we 'll be back .
as many tables were empty and people who came after were seated before us .
this was the worst experienced i 've had in so long !
now we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes for our entrees .
i 'm a vegas resident so i come to this restaurant often .
by far today has been the worse experience ever at this place .
actually its the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
reservations were at 5:30 pm , we did n't get seated until around 6:30pm .
our party had 4pm reservations for christmas day , party of _num_ .
waitress seems easily distracted , especially since she confused our order .
i hate this place .
the mozzarella was ok and so was the caesar .
all of the food was overly garlicky .
the only thing that was semi tasty was the lasagna .
total came to over $ _num_ for everything .
the bread and salads were okay , nothing special .
the rest of the staff in fact , did not .
the service for receiving the main dishes was very slow .
the buca di beppo on lake mead in summerlin is much better .
my wife ordered a linguini with clam and marinara sauce .
went to eat here friday at _num_ .
only reservations were available .
the service staff i would give _num_ stars to .
not yummy !
the food is mediocre , the pricing is too high for bad food .
i 'm sorry buca - but this was a fail .
i have written this place off for you .
i regret not saying anything at the time .
they could n't even clean off the wax .
if we could give zero stars we would as they have earned it !
mixed greens salad was sloppy and slimy !
for $ _num_ , i expected way more in a salad .
lasagna was almost $ _num_ and only so-so !
if you want to stay in business , try way harder , buca !
never going back .
the service was absolutely horrible .
the food taste is mediocre at best .
so , i was kind a dissapointed with the chocolate .
not good .
_num_ stars .
that or having no customers at all .
i would probably hate that job too .
something felt odd so i returned it .
bad management .
too bad bellagio .
the only good thing its that its inside one of my fav hotels mgm .
_num_ waters and a coke !
the chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland .
if i could award this location no stars , i would .
i have never experienced such horrid service at a restaurant in my entire life !
for these prices , i 'd go elsewhere .
they are probably upset they are n't getting a cut of the outrageous prices .
this place is so overpriced it is n't funny .
i got a very weird tasting tea in a dirty glass with no lemon .
but that was basically the only good thing i can say about this experience .
it was ridiculous .
i too had the awesome appetizer adventure which was neither awesome nor an adventure .
the appetizers were lukewarm and the calamari was chewy ( vomit ) .
hype , food sucks , the atmosphere is kinda cool though .
we were told the wait would be _num_ minutes and it was _num_ .
i am pregnant and was ill from being hungry by the time we ate .
there was no sauce on the steak .
it looked to have been cooked _num_ hours prior to our arrival .
what ever you do - do not spend your money here .
you get better food at denny 's and that is n't saying much .
avoid !
nasty food , overpriced alcohol and food .
annoying ambiance .
i made the mistake of ordering the bbq chicken pizza .
i would n't recommend this place to anybody with tastebuds .
i finally got sucked in and went for dinner with a co-worker .
i thought it was bad stuff .
terrible and flavorless - tasted like crappy tgi friday but in the jungle .
i do not suggest it - touristy and awful .
cool waiter saved this from being a total disaster .
the food was horrible !
do yourself a favor and skip this place !
so here we were at the rainforest caf in las vegas mgm .
not my first choice since we had our own in the bay area ?
definitely , not the place for a romantic date or a business lunch meeting .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
the food was horrible .
you would think that would hard to get wrong , but it was terrible .
no flavor , rubbery lobster , and just overall bad .
overall we paid $ _num_ for a horrible meal and bad service .
i would also like a giant mushroom in my room .
_num_ mini hot dogs and some fries for _num_ ?
the mozzarella sticks were mediocre , can not go wrong with that .
server was not that attentive .
the guy then tells us that the wait will be _num_ to _num_ minutes .
way too pricey for what you get .
they were n't bad , but i was pretty much indifferent to them .
consider it an admission fee .
i was disappointed to say the least .
it was not crowded at all .
was a bit tired of hearing them point out the restrooms .
first off , this place blows .
second off , this place really blows .
kids pizza -- $ _num_ .
avoid rain forest cafe at all cost .
a short time later , more servers arrived with the last of the entrees .
so i asked why they did n't have position numbers for the order .
why would a plain burger take longer ?
my biggest complaint was with the staff .
one of the worst restaurant experiences i have had .
i would not recommend it .
this is not what i look for in a restaurant .
the food tastes good but the portions are small and the plates are expensive .
all are very forgettable .
that 's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink .
the waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer .
as for the quality of service , it was mediocre at best .
food was okay , nothing special and nothing i 'd pay extra for .
all in all , not impressed .
i was not aware that this was a national chain .
was i ever disappointed .
my wife ordered the fish & chips & my daughter ordered the coconut shrimp .
the fish was awful - absolutely the worst i have ever sampled .
very little cod filling & the breading was oily & mushy .
it was expensive there , too , but delicious .
the coconut shrimp was so-so , nothing special .
i do n't know how to rate this .
adult side : the food is blah .
the alcoholic beverages were boring or too sweet .
and efficient .
service is impersonal and food is just extremely greasy and not savory at all .
food is ok just ok !
and _num_ % of the orders were correct !
this review is not about the food .
waiting tables is not easy .
all in all , even with kids , i would not recommend this place .
the food and service this past week when we dined was awful !
it took nearly an hour to get our tasteless , mediocre and overpriced food .
note that both were decent , not good .
and then we got sick .
skip over this restaurant .
the food is nothing to brag about .
i left here and immediately felt sick to my stomach .
the service was n't great and the food was so-so .
i 'd give it appearance _num_ stars but the service and food falls short .
the only thing i thoroughly enjoyed was the mocha java shake .
i sucked it all down within minutes .
the fries are whatever .
not super yummy but not gross .
all together a burger , a sandwich and a shake cost me $ _num_ .
it 's pretty looking , but there is no way im going back ... .
everything else with seafood or meat was around the $ _num_ range or more .
like i said earlier not worth the money unless you want the environment .
i most likely wo n't be going back to one of these .
i guess it was bound to happen .
what a damn waste of time and money .
well it is annoying after a while .
they give you cold toast with butter and it does not even melt .
the sausage was nasty and the potatoes were disgusting .
i could not even eat them .
my husband got an omelet and he did not really like his either .
he could n't even finish it .
i am so disappointed because i expected better .
our waiter looked pissed off half the time and refills were a big inconvenience .
their customer service does not really help their cause much .
guess they don not really want to know what you think .
trust me on this one , do n't go .
no way ... in vegas ?
the food sucks .
nothing special , and overpriced .
since i 've been , you do n't have to .
skip it .
i hate this place !
the wait staff is rude all the time !
the drinks are small and expensive and not really that good .
i guess its food .
the meats are chewy and the fries are greasy and usually burned .
showed up cold , bland and soggy .
go here for the atmosphere and thats about the only reason to stop here .
probably not .
sadly i did n't bother reading the reviews for the rainforest cafe beforehand .
what a disappointment .
it was probably _num_ minutes before the waiter came to the table .
but , honestly , does it really take 30-45 minutes to make food ?
they do n't take long to make .
thankfully , it was quick and painless .
kids meals start at $ _num_ and a basic burger will run $ _num_ .
in my opinion , not worth the trouble when there are other options nearby .
the rest of the visit was a sad experience .
$ _num_ for a bowl of kids mac n cheese is too much .
it tasted like a cheap bake at home frozen pizza .
this was the low point of our trip to las vegas .
this was a really bad experience .
so sad .
just not a good night for the rainforest cafe !
nope , instead we were seated against a wall next to the kitchen .
he did nothing to resolve the issue .
in general the food was awful .
it was by far nowhere near worth the money !
and walked on .
i would rather travel back to san francisco .
ick !
our only option at the time was rainforest cafe .
once we were seated the place did n't seem too crowded at all .
while our waitress was n't bad , she was n't all that stellar either .
the waitress was super pissed and her attitude changed immediately .
terrible !
do n't waste your time !
we could not believe how much the menu had gone up in price .
$ _num_ for a burger or sandwich with a small amount of fries .
all in all , there are better choices out there for lunch !
not worth the wait , and not worth the $ .
$ _num_ for a pina colada with not even a hint of rum ?
are we supposed to be paying for the atmosphere ?
nothing to write home about .
the rainforest cafe does not have a dynamite shrimp appetizer .
the coupon is n't valid .
the fries with it were just kinda sad , and a little bit cold .
i 'm not going to go back .
the rainforest cafe had some of the worst service .
when we got our food , it was ok , but not great .
i ordered the turkey wrap , and my sister a burger .
bad food and pushy waiter .
for dinner he got dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets .
it 's a huge tourist trap .
even after my wife and i split an entree we still paid a fortune .
all the ingredients felt and tasted cheap .
the service , however , was great .
i 'm not surprised .
i went with a group of _num_ on a tuesday night .
not somewhere i would go again .
this place is not worth it .
i was unhappy with the service and the choice selection of the menu .
the wait was n't that bad to get a table for _num_ .
we split the turkey wrap as well .
honestly , i would have gotten the same quality wrap at a gas station .
that cost $ _num_ as well .
but do n't expect quality food .
avoid this place find someplace else to spend your dining dollars .
unfortunately , i did n't even get to eat here on my visit .
my friend and i attempted to stop by on a friday afternoon .
no water , no food , no nothing !
sorry rainforest ... but you lost our business !
be advised that this review is based off a first time experience .
i will give this place a _num_ star overall rating .
here is where things started to go downhill .
hey , i 'm not saying not to go to this place .
maybe my wife and i just had bad luck this time around .
your luck might be better and the kitchen might not be running behind .
unfortunately , it tasted like one too .
it was some kind of a chinese chicken salad .
this is n't a restaurant that i will be returning to .
you have got to be kidding me with these prices .
it 's gone downhill !
this time it was super salty and not to mention expensive !
prices are ridiculous , but so is everything in vegas .
i made the mistake of ordering the macadamia crusted tilapia and coconut shrimp !
absolutely tasteless , no flavor .
total waste of time and money .
very pricey for terrible food .
took forever just to get our drinks and even longer for our food .
i wo n't come back here.
they lost us as customers with some lousy service.
ahhh , the rainforest cafe .
though i have bad luck with servers , so this is everywhere nowadays .
the food is hit or miss as well .
and some things are just blah , like the seafood and steaks .
their portion sizes are n't very generous either for how much they 're charging .
really disappointed .
from the moment we go to the restaurant things just got worse .
the food was sub par at best .
it tasted frozen and just not good at all .
i did n't even want to finish it .
not very good the atmosphere was ok .
there are better choices in vegas .
i read the other reviews of this restaurant and they are pretty bad .
long line , inattentive staff , over priced and undercooked food .
came here for my daughters 7th birthday and what a mistake .
disgusting .
the steaks were dry , flavorless , and small .
everything was overpriced , and the wine was terrible .
the potatoes were bland as well .
the food was not very good and the fries were cold .
i would n't come back .
the positives : it 's decorated like the rainforest .
they sat us by the fountain , which you would think would be cool .
and it 's loud , so you have to talk very loud .
our waiter was horrible .
it took over _num_ minutes to get our food .
the food was bad .
as i already state , it was cold .
i got a burger , which was cold and had a very hard bun .
hard like i could hardly bite through it .
the fries were cold and not very good .
nothing had flavor , even the guacamole .
it all tasted like cardboard .
food was horrible .
you pay for an elephant to move every half hr for like _num_ seconds .
service was slow and food was mediocre .
i wo n't be going back .
this place was a bad decision we made on the night we got here .
only about _num_ people were there so it was n't busy .
should have taken it as a sign .
thanks to our garbage waiter our experience was atrocious .
do n't eat here go anywhere else .
the food on the other hand took about _num_ minutes to come out .
i get a little sick thinking about it .
seriously the worst food experience with in las vegas .
i can not come back here ever .
waitress was soooooo slow .
i really expected more from this place .
pure disappointment .
awful food , but at least it 's really expensive .
slow service .
this place is way too loud .
she never brought the straws we asked for .
_num_ minutes later , after my soup was gone she brought me _num_ packs .
the manager eventually saw how pissed we we 're and came over .
this place is not worth it ... especially in vegas .
overpriced bad food .
she literally dropped off the bill and like ran from our table !
terrible !
the service here is horrible .
we could n't get the attention of our waiter .
the food was n't that good either .
prices were ridiculous for what you got .
very loud and yes the waterfall will get you a little wet .
food was too blah for the price .
i wo n't go back .
not our job , dude .
but really why ?
prices ridiculous for quality .
it 's because they 're serving you rotten food .
our server was nice but the service was extremely slow .
my burger was lukewarm and my fries cold .
disgusting !
i lost my appetite immediately .
_num_ minutes later the manager comes to our table .
the most disappointing rainforest i have been to .
food was awful .
my meat was stiff .
do not waste your time going here .
the fish & chips we not cooked properly .
the pot roast was tasteless .
yuck a $ _num_ frozen dinner .
i will never eat at another rainforest cafe .
service is awful and management is even worse .
this place is not worth the price point .
a complete tourist trap .
that is probably why i have never eaten at rainforest before .
it was a musty smell that was horrible .
we also had to wait for crackers which never arrived .
the server was ok ' but the other help was not there .
the adult food was not cooked all the way through on the burger .
the birthday cupcake was dried out and crunchy .
it was awful .
overpriced , under seasoned and horrible service .
um no buddy try again .
he took it off _num_ minutes later i get my bill .
i pay and quickly leave because it was horrible .
nothing that i would pay $ _num_ for .
but i did n't like the atmosphere .
it looked over crowded with fish .
too expensive for mediocre food inside the mgm grand .
what a waste of money .
i mean it 's really bad .
the appetizers are over fried and generally less quality than applebees .
do n't waste your time here .
it was just terrible .
nothing special .
the restaurant looked old .
the mechanical animals looked old and outdated .
and i doubt the tip is actually gon na go to our server .
ridiculously expensive restaurant for ordinary food .
i would not go back here again .
waste of money and calories .
horrible .
servers were polite and apologetic , not their fault .
terribly managed restaurant .
avoid at all costs .
mcdonalds blows this place away .
do not eat here .
i ended up not buying anything because of her crappy attitude .
based on this experience we wo n't be going back .
very limited menu and the food they do serve is sub par .
it was absolutely terrible .
long waits and cold food .
do yourself a favor and just skip it .
the chicken and shrimp were okay but the salad was slimy .
that 's your response when it is plain to see they are n't fresh ?
_num_ minutes to sit down , and over an hour to even get food !
it was over priced , and the food just was n't worth it .
the fries were cold , and the fish was rubbery !
there was also only a single piece of fish .
however it made me feel very ill after .
it was gross overpriced food .
the service was terrible .
fine for families but not for a date in my view .
service was very slow .
just ate here last night .
once seated the waiter rushed through the specials .
i ordered the cobb salad and that shit ruined my vacation !
in addition , the mojito did not have any alcohol in it .
i would n't recommend this place .
the food also tasted like microwaved frozen dinners and i had a turkey club .
a terrible experience !
we waited _num_ minutes ( with _num_ small children ) for our food- unacceptable !
( she did remove the charge . )
$ _num_ for a chicken nugget kid 's meal ?
$ _num_ for a basic burger ?
- unacceptable !
as i see the reviews i am not surprised by the reviews .
bad service , gross food , and annoying atmosphere !
ew !
i guess the kids convinced me again .
beer more like _num_ .
$ _num_ tab for _num_ adult and _num_ kids wtf ?
this place was awful .
ate here before leaving the mgm and wow could not wait to get out .
would not come back to this location .
in short , rainforest cafe is a poor value for the money .
my pasta was served without a spoon .
why would you serve pasta without a spoon ?
so i tried to flagged down a staff .
a server , a busboy , a runner , a hostess or anyone !
we also asked extra plate to share , once again the runner forgotten it .
this place looks great but it is a rip-off !
i could n't believe it .
this was $ _num_ .
i ordered a cobb salad and it was awful .
chicken tasted funny and i was sick the while next day .
wrong .
the restaurant was chaos , even though it was not full .
she said she 'd check and get back to me .
he would have mentioned it but we never saw our waiter again .
we spent $ _num_ and were super disappointed .
we will not be going back .
the food is just awful .
the ambience is neat but you can walk through to see that .
do n't waste your time or money here .
there was barely any tomato flavor and it was too heavy on the cream .
basically not worth your time or money .
overpriced and terrible food .
we were disappointed in this location .
the portions were a lot smaller than the other locations .
i 'd skip this location if you are a rainforest cafe fan .
when it came , it was n't worth the wait .
never again .
came here and got a couple of smoothies and the asian chicken salad .
slow delivery of food and drink .
this did nothing to help us enjoy our meal .
a lot of potential , sloppy execution .
step up your game rainforest las vegas , mgm hotel .
waited _num_ minutes before we even saw the hostess and there was a line .
the menu was very small and food was not very good at all .
very disappointed that i 'm giving this only two stars .
atmosphere and decor was awesome !
staff was not very engaging and did n't seem to be very happy .
order came out wrong with no offer to fix or replace .
chances of me coming back here ever = zero .
the walk was farther than expected .
it was _num_ p.m .
the restaurant is soooo small compared to the original one .
the atmosphere is not the same .
there was only one server for the entire restaurant .
that was way too long .
a big disappointment .
everything else was mediocre .
did n't want to fix it for us .
will not be back .
the food was bland , and sometime tasteless .
the sushi was mediocre and the crab was n't that fresh .
i went last week and totally thought it sucked .
ridiculous !
nothing special - that about sums it up .
sometimes that 's how the choices are made .
unfortunately , no way to possibly try it all .
bad experience at this todai .
but still ... some of the typical stuff like sushi was n't that great .
food was of course was cold or just seemed like it 's been out .
really , todai is totally overpriced and over hyped .
it 's not as great as people put it as .
and it was n't as great to match the price .
it did n't feel or taste fresh .
i did n't dare try a lot of the raw stuff .
my favorite was the chocolate cheesecake .
i live in northern california and todai is around a lot .
seriously , just hand over the uni and nobody gets hurt .
the sushi and sashimi were tasteless .
the beef was cold and inedible , veg was soggy .
very disappointing .
it worst the worst sushi i have ever had .
they even managed to mess up a vegetable chow mein .
wrong !
because it 's the best , it has to be very expensive ... .
the variety of sushi and maki was minimal .
thinking about it still leaves me a bad taste as of today .
you will enjoy stale fish here ... you may not get diarrhea .
if you select specific foods , it is ok .
i did n't try all but may be _num_ % .
many others i can not recommend unfortunately .
do n't waste your precious buffet dollars here .
their servers are pretty bad and not attentive enough .
i have n't been a big fan of todai in a while .
seriously , no balloons , flowers , nothing .
bad form , todai .
bad form .
for that much , bellagio and wynn is a much better bet .
- downhill - they use to mini lobster tails or baked prawns .
it seems everything about this place has gone one notch down .
- sashimi - salmon , tuna , white fish .
the salmon was pretty fresh , but it was almost always empty .
however , they lack flavor .
- i would n't recommend this place .
the quality used to be so much better .
so in other words , not fresh at all .
i am not coming back , and will choose a different place .
possibly the worst restaurant in all of las vegas .
there were about _num_ types of rolls and _num_ types of sushi .
there was no sashimi .
save your money and go to mcdonalds instead .
nothing here is unique , nothing here stands out .
the meats , prime rib , roast pork , were beyond dry .
after reading several yelp reviews , we decided to try this place out .
man , were we disappointed .
the food should be rated a zero or negative .
this place is called todai sushi and seafood buffet restaurant .
sushi dishes were awful .
and , what , they charge _num_ ?
there are so many other places with better sushi in town .
sushi sub par , atmosphere depressing , and hot food bleh .
sorry todai of las vegas but fail .
if i could give this place no stars i would .
the food is bland and the sushi is n't very good .
it is a waste of money and quite a bit of money at that !
the crab was absolutely disgusting , it was inedible in fact .
i figured most vegas buffets include drinks in the price .
heck , the bellagio buffet is cheaper now and they have king crab legs !
i paid $ _num_ for dinner and quickly noticed that they had no salmon ?
they did serve yellowtail , which is unusual for todai but no salmon .
i know what to expect at todai but this particular one was very disappointing .
we assumed wrong .
several pieces were tasty , but most were very bland with little flavor .
dessert : this was both a high and low point .
but that 's not the bad part .
the food was really really bad .
the fried rice tasted like an old cigarette butt .
our glass of water stayed empty for about 10-15 minutes .
it was a complete waste of time and money .
this was worse than store bought boxed sushi .
it was gritty and bland .
the potatoes were out of a box .
we were literally sick to our stomachs and grossed out by this dining experience .
luckily we did n't get sick .
i 'm sure they would n't have done much .
anyway , avoid this place at all costs !
back in the midwest , we did n't have japanese buffets .
that 's the problem with chains - quality is n't there .
the service was horrible and the food tasteless .
i will not be returning .
remember , there are two type of buffets in vegas .
a little expensive considering there wasnt much to offer .
no crab legs , no shrimp , nothing but sushi .
oh wait there was _num_ different types of mussels out .
i left still hungry for more food unfortunately .
i was n't impressed during lunch hour due to lack of selection here .
well ... food was far better than lunch .
yeah , the problem happened when i used $ _num_ restaurant.com voucher .
i gave her _num_ % tip , but really tempted to leave without tip .
it would be my last visit to todai for sure .
there are simply too many other alternatives .
disgusting un edible food and way overpriced .
hands down the worst sushi i have ever had , and incredibly overpriced .
salmon should not ever have the consistency of squid .
$ _num_ for two people and the fish slices fall off the rice .
the clam soup was disgusting .
overpriced for mediocre quality , but the variety is what you pay for .
one dish you ca n't screw up that i always get is the udon .
i 'm a big crab leg snob !
so i would recommend lunch only !
probably had over _num_ varieties of sushi to select from .
they also had `` okay '' customer service - nothing to write home about .
overall , glad i did n't pay full price for dinner .
and probably would n't go back for dinner .
oyster is so fishy and the sushi was disgusting .
kitchen food was so bad .
i can not believe the food was not worth a penny .
the buffet on fridays and saturdays is _num_ .
these are not even set up on the table .
plus it 's in the miracle mile mall , tucked away down a hallway .
if you not a sushi eater , you are ok .
rice seasoning was not properly applied as well .
it was way too hard .
the raw tuna was bright red and salmon was falling apart .
all pointing to the low quality of supply products .
in brooklyn this place would be closed in a month .
usually like this place but wo n't be coming back .
not going to pay my money to be watched constantly and rushed out .
terrible experience , poor service and terrible attitude .
the food is substandard and the setting of the place is poorly done .
dirty utensils and cups .
the tempura vegetables were bland and the desserts lacked flavor .
lots of asian food and lots of cheap sushi .
it 's not bad , but it 's not good .
i would n't go back if it was n't free .
food is not fresh , not much selection of food in the buffet .
utensils are not clean .
i will not come back .
this is hands down the worst sushi i have eaten .
needless to say , my husband and i will not return .
i brought a friend from out of town and it was a little embarrassing .
do n't think i would consider coming back .
the management here need more training , kate and april .
i came with my _num_ year old grandmother , whom was asleep .
she really does n't eat at all .
i am shocked at the attitude of the management here , especially kate .
this place has horrible management .
we got out of the show around _num_ and made it there around _num_ .
hello this is vegas who closes at 9pm .
no more .
we ate there on january _num_ , _num_ .
things started out bad .
they got worse .
the service was poor .
way to ruin my birthday .
even one star is too enough to rate here .
sushi was not fresh at all and sucks .
please do not throw your money here .
sushi rice was hard and fish was not fresh !
very small pieces of sushi .
place was not busy ... had to keep asking for refills .
not worth _num_ .
terrible food .
do n't happen upon this place like we did , you 'll regret it .
ok i never write reviews about restaurants , however i will about todai sushi .
after eating here the next day i felt like i was going to die !
also the food was disgusting .
usually i can find one thing i like but no everything tastes nasty .
maybe it was because they had _num_ hours until closing but still .
even the miso soup was nasty .
how do you mess that up ?
do n't eat the crab legs what ever you do !
i got so sick i felt like i was going to die .
and it 's not expensive .
i highly do n't recommend eating here !
i 'm just trying to save you some money and a belly ache .
i wish i could leave no stars but it does n't allow that .
so many other great sushi places just a hop skip and jump away !
( others would have gave nothing .
the seafood was very boring and did not taste anything .
sushi was okay , but i 've eaten better .
waiter was rude and probably hates his job .
food terrible and bad service .
wo n't come back .
sushi was good but other than that the experience was terrible .
if you want good service and food , avoid this place .
seafood wide , i personally do n't like it .
dessert is sad .
staffs are very rude .
maybe they are too busy or we caught them at the wrong time .
i do n't feel like i am in a restaurant at all .
after each customer , they only remove the paper .
again like i said i dont feel like i am in a restaurant .
restaurant is not clean .
overall , will not recommended and will never come back.
i normally do n't want to give any bad rating like _num_ star .
but todai in miracle shop - las vegas is unacceptable .
am i too harsh ?
you might get a new hot dish if you have enough time and patience .
presentation of foods looks cheap .
i had a feeling as they were afraid customers would eat too much .
restroom looks dirty , not well maintenance .
only thing i had here was the hot chocolate .
the hot chocolate was watered down and did n't have much favor at all !
i consumed only half of it and then rest went into the trash .
the sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly .
we also tried their brownie which taste more like fudge .
the moment we walked in , the place looked like a ghost town .
horrible service .
cheesy outfits .
gross .
the worst customer service i have ever encountered .
totally talked down to me and said awful things .
i started crying when we left because it was so bad .
this store was able to resolve the problem but they were rude about it .
additionally , my husband lost his phone in the store .
called a week prior to confirm that all has been paid for .
i was confused on why that occurred when everything has been paid in full .
all they said was i 'm sorry .
very disappointed .
they got my simple order wrong .
no flavor .
and the cheese part o the philly cheesesteak is practically mia .
avoid unless you just want to burn money .
never knew it was possible to have such bland food .
sandwich was just alright and fries were nothing to really savor .
what an awful experience it was eating at this place .
the cashier had poor listening skills and no patience in taking orders .
you get no cheese in this cheese steak .
as the other reviewers stated , their food is bland .
should gave gone to wendy 's just in the next stall .
quality : poor .
came right before closing , but still this is suppose to be fast food .
no attitude and provided everything i needed .
the worst was the food .
the turnaround was also pretty sad .
nothing , which made me wonder what i just poured all over my sandwich .
and there was barely any cheese !
not coming back again .
terrible .
is n't that the point of having a restaurant ?
ugh , pretty bad .
i 'm not a super picky eater but when something sucks it sucks .
zero flavor , no seasoning , just not good at all .
pretty bummed that i wasted $ _num_ on this .
cashier and cook doing it all .
chicken philly tasted plain .
it also made me feel extremely uncomfortable .
there 's no reason to spend time or money at this place .
i had the worst experience here !
not exactly the best cpk experiences i 've ever experienced .
food is mediocre , like every other cpk .
waiters and waitresses tend to be a bit slow attending to diner 's needs .
honestly , this place was garbage .
first off , extremely poor service .
not a good start to our meal .
did i mention that the food was n't very good ?
the bread was stale and the salad was mediocre at best .
overall though , terrible service and pretty terrible food .
will not be back .
um ... no .
coming from a hospitality background , i understand that it gets busy .
looking around the restaurant on this particular night , it was not .
it was a weekday and there were a ton of empty tables .
maybe this location just sucks .
a friend and i went here on a weekday around _num_ pm .
the waitress was n't overly nice or helpful .
slow slow slow slow .
slow service , and the food certainly does n't make up for it .
the food is standard and consistent .
the pesto is not my favorite .
p.s .
from my experience , the service is faster .
too pricey for what you get , then again it 's vegas .
pizza was alright , nothing spectacular .
no more tri color pizza and they changed the passion fruit iced tea .
then they got some of the orders wrong .
due to waiting some of our food was cold and dry .
no apologies were given .
it was very disappointing and it seemed like they didnt care .
very overpriced for las vegas terrible service .
the food was just ok , you can get so much better in vegas .
she did not like it .
it was pretty crowded but we only had about a _num_ minute wait .
after we got our food , we realized it was made incorrect .
incredibly rude servers .
mediocre dining experience .
however , this cpk was a huge disappointment !
everything from the pizza to the pasta and appetizers were all horrible .
the kung pao spaghetti lacked sauce and the flavor was very very off .
the pizza was dry and very salty .
the spinach dip was oily and the mac n cheese was plain boring .
the food served here was the worst experience we 've had at cpk .
waste of money and no one was happy with their meal .
the taste was n't that great either !
i recently took an _num_ year old young girl to lunch .
our total bill was only $ _num_ .
i gave our waitress $ _num_ as i wanted change for a tip .
when she returned the change , i received only $ _num_ , no coins .
i could n't get her attention but did reach another server .
do you know how much extra money they rip off from patrons ?
came here on my lunch break and the service was horrible .
it took the server at least _num_ minutes to take our drink order .
maybe _num_ minutes for a half a salad a small pizza .
this is not the place to go if you 're in a hurry .
extremely rude customer service from their takeout server .
the manager , however , apologized for his rudeness and comped our takeout order .
gluten free pizza crust was horrible .
ate the toppings and left the rest .
service was incredibly slow and lacked overall .
would not recommend and will not be going back .
the worst school in vegas .
it 's a cheap school , but you get what you pay for .
do n't waste your time and money .
it 's a complete scam !
salad was n't that good either .
the dining area looked like a hotel meeting room .
looked a little too modern for my taste .
and do n't go to broadway prime .
it 's worse than lawry 's .
trying to copy but ca n't get it right .
go just for the dessert - banana cream pie ... yummy !
but , for me , i do n't get it .
also , i do n't get the vibe here .
and i feel so sorry for the dudes who cut the prime rib .
and its way over-priced , utterly ridiculous .
how so very , very disappointing .
eh - i was a bit underwhelmed .
the place looked a bit shabby to me , and the food was mediocre .
i was not a fan of the spinning salad at all .
the waiter and bus boy , barely spoke english .
one bite confirmed it was gross .
they would n't accept the gift cards we had for the whole amount .
said they could only use $ _num_ of the $ _num_ on the card .
but this time ... not so much .
also ordered the pumpkin pie ... it was horrible .
i ca n't believe the ratings this place gets .
very lean actually , which is a sign of lower grade prime rib .
do n't waste your time here .
the steak was fine but hardly the best i 'd ever had .
not on my list of place s to go back to .
my wife and i went here after reading all of the yelp reviews .
the dinning room was too bright and had a banquet hall feel .
waitress said there would be a $ _num_ dollar fee for this ?
but $ _num_ dollars to split a meal in half ?
the waitress was also flat and had zero personality .
by the way , your outfits are suck .
has anyone been to house of prime rib in sf ?
i will never waste my money here .
did they have to grow the romaine lettuce in the back real quick ?
eh , cream corn .
wrong !
it was really tasty but $ _num_ for that and some mashed potatoes ?
for the comment he made to my wife he deserved nothing .
ok , not a fan here .
she said no so , i asked to speak with the manager .
i am not a fan and will not try to eat here again .
the spinning salad in my opinion was less than great .
salad drenched in thousand island dressing ... hmm .
i was expecting something amazing ... and it was not .
however , i felt the service was lacking .
we tried a raspberry mojito , yum !
we were seated and was greeted by our hostess and was presented our menu .
i ordered the prime rib dinner and was a bit disappointed .
the rib was tender however , was a bit flavorless .
the mashed potatoes were sub-par .
service : slow and not impressive .
also i was not offered a refill on my iced tea either .
_num_ bites in and i 'm like this is so disappointing .
verdict : not impressed .
_num_ stars .
totally empty .
not a good sign .
the `` lunch special '' was a bbq sandwich for $ _num_ .
it was god horrible .
could n't eat it .
the meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside .
i returned that for the prime rib sandwich for $ _num_ .
but - $ _num_ ?
it was basically a slab of meat with some au jus sauce .
recommendations : hit up the local black angus or outback steakhouse instead .
sadly this is going to be a very mixed review .
when seated there was n't a sole in the place .
to be fair the drink was flawless .
when i walked in the door i thought i was at a nursing home .
the decor was so outdated and the waitresses outfits were down right ridiculous .
our bill was $ _num_ and it was worth about $ _num_ .
food is not served to you at lunch .
the server rarely came back to check on us .
just rude service !
spinning salad was blah .
lettuce drenched in dressing does n't make a great salad .
nothing to write home about .
one of the few times i really did n't clean my plate .
waiter was slow and charged us for a drink he made wrong .
why ?
i feel it my civic duty to add my _num_ cents .
the service was just eh for the price you 're paying .
she obviously knew them and was in no hurry to tend to us .
the food was rather mediocre as well .
the flavor of the prime rib was also quite lacking .
so incredibly disappointing .
on top of that paying vegas prices for sub par food .
their service feels old here ... as in outdated .
service was friendly but rather inefficient .
you know we 'll have a good rib then .
me and my husband went for dinner last night .
not our first time .
however , we had a horrible experience this time .
real bad service !
it was just all wrong from start to finish .
he did n't know his beers .
we figured , it happens , no big deal .
it was a slow tuesday night for heaven 's sake .
he offered dessert , we said no .
like i said , , worst service ever .
but it was bad !
he had already ruined ours !
no problem with us .
however after _num_ minutes , we checked back and were immediately seated .
we explained , no waitress , no food , no nothing .
prime rib , not great , we 've had way better .
the au jus tasted like it was made from a dried powder mix .
we wo n't be going back .
have to say , we were very disappointed .
the portions were very small .
no au juice was offered or served .
but sadly , that 's not what i feel today .
when we need our waitress , we could not find her .
mediocre !
we did n't get an explanation of the menu unlike house of prime rib .
i can say that it was a complete disappointment .
it was not seasoned well .
when we received it , it was lukewarm at best .
the plate was by far warmer than the prime rib itself .
poorly prepared !
it was so rubbery and overcooked .
trying to cut a piece off was difficult enough .
just imagine chewing a piece ?
it was like chewing on a rubber band .
i do n't mind paying but i 'd like to know its additional .
i could 've passed on it since it was simply forgettable .
this place was a fail in every aspect .
it tasted like a regular steak with little seasoning .
i do n't like how they do n't show the prices on the menu .
in my opinion it 's way over priced .
after a _num_ to _num_ minute wait we were seated at a booth .
overhaul a terrible food experience but rhonda 's service was great .
creamed spinach is inedible .
skip this , especially for the price , should be way better .
poor customer service from restaurant and server .
no response still a week later from the restaurant .
terrible .
the worst dining experience i ever had !
unfortunately it did not happen .
what a load of crap this deal was !
it was cut thick on one side and very thin at the other end .
she was going to leave it at that but husband continued to question it .
seriously - do u argue w the customer at this class of restaurant ?
at the end we were all very unhappy .
pretty disappointed ate here last week it was n't great .
nothing was bad by any means but nothing was impressive .
again , not bad , but nothing special .
went there tonight !
female servers are dressed in old southern times complete with very authentic looking outfits .
no way about it not one good piece of meat in the bunch .
took _num_ hours and _num_ mins to have a typical dinner .
terribly slow service .
this visit was that .
quite possibly one of the worst services i had in recent memory .
so , probably my biggest pet peeve , is beverage service .
i only drink soda so i 'll go through several in a meal .
salad seemed ... just ok.
dinner plate appeared sloppy .
just seems like the attention to detail has declined at this location .
mashed potatoes were runny .
side spinach dish was weak .
the bill can add up fairly quickly .
took my parents for dinner this week and could n't have been less impressed .
the salad , meat , and potatoes were very bland .
service was slow with the restaurant being less than half full .
for the price , i would have expected much more .
first off , i 'm not a fan of the salad .
i skipped dessert and waited for the check to arrive .
but again ... i 'm just not impressed .
_num_ star .
if my wife 's not happy , i 'm not happy .
and the valet service is clueless and rude .
staff dresses in uniforms they used in the 50s .
first cart had nothing well done .
so half our party ate while the other half waited for their food .
drink was light in the alcohol content .
it was bloody and both of our prime ribs were no more than lukewarm .
my husband 's `` medium '' rib was literally dripping blood .
the mashed potatoes & creamed spinach were good .
we wo n't be going back .
i could n't have been more wrong .
the service is ok , if a little slow to start .
it was n't just boring , it also tasted like thousand island dressing .
we also ordered a side of asparagus and a baked potato .
they were n't tender and were mostly tasteless .
how do you mess up a ribeye ?
the asparagus was _num_ pieces and was over cooked .
the backed potato was ok , but could have had a crunchy skin .
lastly we gave them one more chance with dessert by ordering their creme brle .
the spinning salad is a joke - and nasty .
tasted like something in an elementary school cafeteria .
bottom line - the food is not worth the money .
was n't that good .
when we asked for such a person , they had no one .
i hated my experience in this place , last may _num_ .
the sound system was horrible !
hopefully the management wo n't let a vegas classic die out ... .
hello - no waitress .
i had forgotten that i used to order it with dressing on the side .
it was awful .
when the salmon finally came it was way too salty .
all in all , a very unpleasant experience for a lot of money .
i went to a wedding in may and the sound system was horrible !
i had however , never brought a child with me .
( it 's what i did with my kids too ) .
i really did n't think it was going to be an issue .
they were not happy that a child was at their table .
lawry 's you get a zero for service this night .
you have no patience for your younger guests .
i think this place is very unprofessional and careless .
i will no longer be using this low down place .
you could n't pay me to go here .
i inquired about dry cleaning once and they were so rude about giving prices .
it scared the hell out of me !
talk about incredibly rude and disrespectful !
never again will i give my money to this place .
the place was empty and our table was sticky .
_num_ stars for attentive service but the food ?
with so many other choices why go here ?
this franchise in caesars was absolutely horrible .
no tip , nothing .
will never dine here again .
in chinese until we walked out of the store .
and he did n't know how much longer the sale would last .
the only thing the staff @ front desk could offer was a _num_ credit .
ca n't wait to post reviews on the internet about this one !
i feel as if nobody cared and nobody offered any help in this matter .
this is a review of the meeting facilities , and not the rooms .
i have no experience of the guest rooms at this location .
gross .
horrible front desk .
utterly clueless and slow .
first , vegas ... its a crap hole .
does n't matter where you go its a crap hole .
i expect there are nice parts , i just did n't find them .
the place is a crap hole .
would n't recommend taking a midnight stroll .
sun thru thursday , the hotel is quiet .
housekeeping manager ... gone .
maintenance manager ... gone .
but maybe i 'm just being critical here .
did i mention vegas is a crap hole ?
i did mention that vegas was a crap hole did n't i ?
maybe the worst business hotel / value ever .
beds not great .
i live locally and was n't renting a room .
she told me there was nowhere in the building for me to pump .
i suggested someone 's office , and she said no .
she allowed me to use a smoking room .
i also reeked like cigarettes the rest of the day .
a little below par for a hilton property .
the restaurant and bar could not take credit cards .
this made no sense at all .
i turned it on and it appeared there was a small leak .
very annoying .
unsure why , but enough of a reason to leave _num_ star .
slightly better than motel _num_ , really old by vegas standards .
how am i going to give this embassy suites more than one star .
never stay here again .
it was just unpleasant .
will not be back !
_num_ stars because you get a free breakfast that is not horrible .
gosh was i wrong !
the room was less than desirable .
the horrible door from the living space to the room .
the bathroom was disgusting !
it 's not sanitary .
the plumbing disaster !
the shower did not drain !
so all the water just sits there all through your shower .
no still backed up .
rolling thru vegas .
by the way , this is 11pm on a thursday .
did i mention that i paid an extra $ _num_ for this luxury ?
i stayed here back in april .
my biggest complaint is the staff at this place .
we stayed here from july _num_ to july _num_ and will never come back .
the only thing that was decent was the complementary breakfast .
this place is unclean , and service is terrible .
the hotel description was not the same as the actual room .
the service sucked !
plus , the hotel kitchen had no options for eating gluten free .
all in all very very disappointed and would not stay there again .
worse part is that you can not find a taxi here .
you wo n't find one off main street .
they use one company and the one they use is not good .
however , the bathroom , specifically the shower , was just plain nasty .
i do not have long hair so certainly not mine from yesterday .
obviously not cleaned well .
a side note typical of many older hotels is not enough plugs .
no place to plug phone in next to bed .
bagels and coffee would have been great .
the hospital where we work paid for this conference room .
she rudely said we would have to pay almost _num_ for the buffet .
either eat at the buffet or eat nothing .
she said that is ridiculous and gave us room keys .
i have looked through some of your reviews and there are several bad ones .
went here for a continuing education course .
the food set up was very bland .
coffee , tea , water , juice .
plain bagels with warm cream cheese and no butter .
super disgusting .
to piss me off ?
horrible service .
had to call multiple times to get towels yet they were never delivered .
very disappointing stay all around .
the lobby staff made no effort to accommodate us with a different room .
this hotel is not kept up .
this was extremely frustrating and a huge waste of my time .
i would not recommend this hotel .
my mom requested a handicapped room .
my room was n't that clean either .
we had carpet stains and the bathroom was not clean !
nasty !
stay away unless you do n't mind cleaning your room .
everything i requested was not honored .
the summer league basketball was there as well .
they were so noisy !
no water pressure in the bathroom in one of the rooms .
the glass doors for the shower is hard to move back and forth .
both rooms in the tub the water takes long to go down .
so next door there was a housekeeping the lady was just standing there .
so i walked around didnt see one .
i walked over there and it wasnt close .
it was out of order .
at this point i was so irritated !
so i called again to guest services .
so the other _num_ floors didnt and now this needs one ?
im now so pissed off and just freakin ready to check out !
the hotel just sucks !
the clothes are really expensive but cheap made .
very disappointed .
had a horrible experience shopping here .
and she said it _num_ times !
had a horrible experience shopping here .
and she said it _num_ times !
i walked in with my sisters and my fiance earlier this month .
( i get the same treatment from gucci , btw .
as i went in , the majority of the the salespeople were fine .
however , there was this one lady that was rude to me .
that was just beyond rude .
it felt so uncomfortable browsing .
not one had a friendly personality .
bad service .
but she was nonetheless offended and took our business to another nearby boutique .
this boutique is extremely small , not well lit and not well stocked .
we were prepared to buy , but walked out .
i visited this store twice this week .
such a big brand but lack of customer service !
i guess i 'll stick with chanel !
next time i 'm in vegas i will not stay here .
all in all this place is just okay .
strike two ... booked a room again .
and early check-in is an extra $ _num_ .
_num_ minutes talking to front desk got us nowhere and we left frustrated .
unfortunately , our room was broken into .
we filed a report , and asked to change rooms .
when we got back to our old room , our keys would n't work .
w. t. f .
and talked to the front desk manager again .
no offer to comp anything .
very clean , large room .
and there is a $ _num_ charge for early checkin .
well maintained place , management is not very good .
on the one hand , the rooms were gigantic .
like , almost too big .
straight up , we did not check in to a suite !
needless to say , i do not want to stay here again .
i just wish i had n't tried this one .
stayed for one friday night .
havent upgraded to flat screens yet .
our shower door was hard to open !
we ordered extra towels and they arrived _num_ hours after we called for them .
not as nice as the ones of the strip .
service was slow .
confusing parking ( depends on which building you are in ) .
needless to say , i was furious at the customer service .
i had n't slept in a double bed since i was in elementary .
he then told me he gave me an updated room .
updated room the first time , whatever .
i guess they ca n't handle _num_ people in the bar at one time .
- the house wine sucks .
good thing i was n't picking up the tab .
however , this time was the last straw for me .
even though i called twice and was assured that it would be no problem .
i wish i had two more hands to give this place _num_ thumbs down .
anyway , i put out my cigar and we left .
the guy at the front desk was so rude when we checked in .
not a great way to start .
not cool .
not comfy .
the ceilings in the rooms are really low .
beds were n't super but whatever .
the front desk service ... oh my goodness , it was terrible !
they did n't understand that .
but my lovely front desk lady just chose to ignore what i was saying .
but no .
so this worker spent _num_ minutes trying to check me in .
there is no microwave ( ?
they gave me keys to another room .
no , i do not think i will book here again .
i was very disappointed with this hotel .
why bother .
security is not very friendly !
no thanks .
that really annoying in vegas because people come and go at all hours .
`` think twice '' is not enough to say before booking this hotel !
that makes no sense whatsoever .
i did n't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe .
i did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running .
that was really loud .
should n't she know that ?
the food at the mexican restaurant and marilyn 's cafe was just so-so .
i 'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it .
also , the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous !
that is so ridiculous !
the pool was probably the only thing that was n't that bad .
the tuscany 's service is some of the worst i 've experienced .
the mexican place was not good , and the service was slow and poor .
we would 've eaten elsewhere if there would 've been choices nearby .
if you rent a cabana , you do not get your own waitress .
that is unacceptable behavior to a guest .
bottom line : stay here if you are looking for dirt cheap prices .
i will not stay here again .
for one , the valet is not quick and speedy .
not cool .
problem _num_ : no free wifi in rooms !
do n't waste your money on this one .
i wrote a complaint to the hotel but have not heard anything back .
i stayed here for a work conference and i will never be back .
chair at desk in room is steel and uncomfortable .
no power switch available .
no place in shower to place your toiletries , shampoo , razor , etc .
noticed upon arrival that the bathroom floor was not cleaned .
however , in both suites the toilets had problems .
i doubt i will go back .
i will just stay elsewhere off the strip ; somewhere on paradise road .
also went to the gym a couple of times .
also looked like they offered other services ( massage , etc . )
too .
way , way , way too much .
it has definitely been that last one , and otherwise mostly just trashy .
a lot of it is broken , but with an attempted repair in place .
the fixtures in the bathroom are all old and slightly crusty .
the bathroom again is huge , but not to any purpose .
there is something about this hotel room that makes me think crime scene .
since it 's off the strip , the rates are cheaper .
if you want to have a cheaper vegas experience , this can do it .
i would never stay here again .
there was no microwave .
now it 's been over _num_ hours and still no call or e-mail .
your team did not even acknowledge our patronage .
does the management even do any research about their repeat customers ?
not a great way to treat us , i 'm afraid .
hopefully tuscany will contact me to resolve this issue .
overpriced mexican food and lazy staff minus one guy at the resturant .
perhaps i stuffed a microwave in my carry on .
lastly , i forgot an item in the room .
i called hours after i checked out and my property was not turned in .
very disappointed with this unclean hotel and with the management .
never in my life have i had a more unpleasant experience at any hotel .
all they could offer was a king bed with a couch .
this could n't be happening !
their response was more attitude and a negative to the request .
no luck .
not at all what we expected .
do not be fooled that it is called `` suites '' .
the fridge was not on , we had to turn it on .
and our non smoking room smells like smoke .
do not stay here .
meanwhile , they made my husband sit at the lobby .
long story short , we 've been to many hotels .
but the casino itself definitely leaves something to be desired .
there are much better places to lose your money .
no _num_ minute wait for your car here that 's for sure .
i give this place negative _num_ stars .
what hotel does not have cameras in the hallway ?
the service in which they provided us was ridiculous .
then again , you do n't have to stay anywhere .
why not just wander the streets for a few days without sleeping ?
apologies to whoever was below us .
service execution was uneven .
believe it or not , the food was good .
the casino sucks , they have like _num_ tables .
and not only did they not refund me my deposit .
i left the room as i found it .
i was very disappointed .
wouldnt even color me out when i left after that .
worst concierge service !
he was not friendly , and not helpful .
and i had to do the small task there .
to the their casino and up to the 2nd floor .
the internet , and then you can print the page .
and i am here at the hotel for _num_ nights .
i am so tempted to try and check out and stay somewhere else ... .
who is people friendly , and enjoys assisting others .
horrible customer service and drug dealers in the parking lot .
staff are not on top of things and unfriendly .
i 've stayed in better cheaper places .
rooms can use better lighting .
and she responded `` we never guarantee extras such as a microwave .
the laundry facility is nasty .
there are only _num_ washers and _num_ dryers and all are falling apart .
filthy , nasty , wet dirty towels all over the place .
have stayed here many times but this time was not good .
server was slow , lazy and indifferent .
it ruined the pool atmosphere .
waited _num_ min both times .
not anymore .
was not tuscany , was not even room stays .
turned out to be another 3rd party booking agency , expedia .
needless to say i was confused and very angry .
the managers had no power or authority to do anything regarding the resort fee .
they did n't even have anyone to call for assistance .
no thank you .
spent another _num_ minutes with the real manager in the morning .
the tuscany manager took off about $ _num_ dollars .
$ _num_ ; can you believe it ?
let me start by saying i have never ever written a review .
i am doing so because of how terrible my experience was .
however the rest makes it so not worth it .
also do not host an event here !
you had to walk through the edge of the casino get to the event !
terrible job tuscany !
your luck i do n't sue you for all of my $ back .
this place is cheap and to stay ... great .
but i play craps and they have an _num_ second dice setting rule .
: ) stay here for the cheap rooms but take your gambling money elsewhere .
horrible experience .
three of us had it and we did n't eat it .
highly disappointing .
_num_ days after the theft and still no resolution .
if i had checked out , my room card would n't have worked .
you get what you pay for , really .
prior to the renovation that was completed in _num_ , it was pretty bad .
ask for frank ... he 'll take care of you .
worst casino hotel i 've ever been to !
this hotel is a complete & absolute nightmare .
the next day however , guess where the pillow was ?
i come back that night , pillow is gone ( yay ! )
change my room ?
this hotel is a complete & absolute nightmare .
the next day however , guess where the pillow was ?
i come back that night , pillow is gone ( yay ! )
change my room ?
crap !
they were not tremendously friendly .
i have been lucky enough to have never experienced a theft .
not clear on price of room and hidden charges were applied .
long walk from room to casino .
bad hotel and service !
the rooms smell , the fridge was ridiculously loud !
horrible experience ... will never stay here again !
ask for james the server he is awesome !
and nobody wants to be responsible there .
worst hotel stay of my life .
i do n't advise anyone else to either .
very bad experience - stay away if you can .
i wish i could put zero stars !
next , the toilet would run every _num_ minutes and make noise .
management = horrible .
rooms = falling apart .
also , the grass was fake .
i was a little disappointed with my experience at this hotel .
wish i had n't met them at the tuscany .
terrible customer service .
hotel management rude .
got ripped off first night .
the room also had mold in a/c .
tv did n't work .
no discount or refund for first horrible night in room .
they lost a long time customer .
the room prices were comparable to _num_ star hotels on the strip .
the hotel did not try to accommodate this at all .
the main desk did not try to help at all .
terrible .
overall , i do not recommend this hotel for stay in vegas .
it 's just average to below average for what you pay .
i 'm sure people with no standards love this place .
i have also never seen such small bath towels in all my life .
i 'm used to getting more value in my meals .
overall very disappointed .
i am completely disgusted and disappointed .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
i was very disappointed .
as soon as we checked into our room , it smelled like vomit .
a big _num_ dollars .
this place is infested !
not to mention , the light in the bathroom did n't work .
called the front desk and was put on hold for _num_ minutes .
my fiancee talked them in to a second $ _num_ voucher .
then , we found a dead roach on the throw pillow on our bed !
we searched the room for bugs and fortunately did n't find anything else .
gross !
the only good thing about this place is the valet .
other than that , do n't waste your time .
small , smokey and ca n't get a cocktail for over an hour .
i booked our stay through priceline .
after checking out i noticed the security deposit had not been refunded .
so , they refunded my security deposit to priceline ?
i 'm at the hotel now .
no free wifi in the rooms .
the lap pool is empty , under repair .
no service to sell you quarters to use the laundry facilities .
nothing special , just okay .
my sister and i just went and here is my review .
the food i would rate a _num_ .
my sister was too cold and call the front desk our first day .
still , no extra blankets were brought in .
it was obvious because they had nasty looking blankets and pillows .
i am not one to give a bad review .
we lost everything at this place .
never ever consider staying at this place !
you will regret it for the rest of your entire life .
this is the worst hotel i ever have in las vegas .
they charge me _num_ dollars .
fridge leaking water all over the floor .
this place seems like it has n't been kept up since the last century .
just do n't do it .
i have been to a better casino in a tent lol .
the manager on duty would not make eye contact with me .
the tuscany does not give manager on any authority to make decision .
the beds where super small and not that comfortable !
now the casino was horrible !
just stayed in building i third floor by the elevator .
got in at _num_ o'clock in the morning .
worst night ever in a hotel .
one of the worst stays of my life .
first of all , parking sucks .
i will never stay in this hotel as long as i live .
when asked why again he said , `` because i said so . ''
the front desk staff member was rude as well .
this is very disappointing because we have never had any issues prior .
there 's a really bad , noisy and old air conditioner in the room .
probably the ones i saw in 90s were not as bad .
it was very disturbing and i had to wake up a couple of times .
the amenities in the room sucked big time .
horrible !
we bring _num_ guests , each year , for our annual conference .
and they do n't even care .
the staff does n't care .
and while they did move us , it totally ruined my weekend .
but a water bug problem .
it does n't even deserve one star .
that right off the bat is a negative star .
the rooms are noisy and walls are thin .
it was n't our fault the fire alarm went on .
our key cards never worked properly .
that is not what the tuscany resort is known for i guess .
they clearly are n't out to make return guests out of people .
annoying .
there 's a late check out fee sometimes according to the front desk .
horrible !
i was beginning to feel uncomfortable and very unhappy .
i became quite angry at this point as did my best friends .
both staff and rings have changed for the worse .
came last week on sunday ( no pun intended ) and was very disappointed .
not such a bad deal you might think , yes ?
actually pretty sad with about _num_ or less people .
maybe one dancer was a _num_ .
weak !
these girls were nothing to look at with faces for radio .
i didnt want a lap dance from any of them .
try another lv club .
there are def enough variety in lv .
terrible !

all and all you get what you pay for ... .
not much .
it was empty and girls were not very pretty !
horrible place !
place was empty .
they were still pissed .
no one danced on stage .
place sucked big time ... do n't waste your time !
very dead !
all ugly .
this club was a major disappointment , the second time i came here .
the first time , i came here , this club was off the chain .
the bartender , was smoking hot , though .
i just wish they could hire better looking strippers during the daytime .
this place , hands down the worst experience i have ever had !
the staff was horrible !
the bar was disgusting !
it was that gross !
staff had to be the worst most unprofessional people i have ever met .
do not come to this place your experienced will be ruined !
my boyfriend and i went here for my birthday , last night .
i tried ordering a mai tai : they were out of pineapple .
not all was lost .
limo driver took us to another venue and saved the evening .
first time to try to see some shows in vegas .
and had rude words .
bar tender was just terrible .
would not come back .
absolutely the worst experience at a gentlemen 's club ever .
that 's ridiculously bad !
that bartender was terrible and clearly management does n't care enough about anything there .
should be a no star !
everything about this place sucked !
thought there would be less pressure going to a smaller club .
never enter this place unless you 're looking to get ripped off !
this place is horrible !
would not do any business with them .
very poor customer service !
i 'd leave a _num_ star rating if i could .
do n't go to this place !
it 's the first time i have encountered such a bad experience !
i had no problem with the price as long as i know the feature .
clearly he has no interest to sell any of the items .
this place should have closed down long time ago .
i would give it negative stars if it is allowed .
i highly recommend that you avoid this establishment at all cost .
can i say rude , rude , rude , rude & rude .
horrible little shop on first visit , i can not recommend .
if you 're not wearing a suit and tie , do n't bother .
the staff was very helpful .
room has mini fridge , coffee maker , stove , sink and microwave .
i would give this place negative stars .
there were ants all over our door when i first entered our room .
disgusting !
and the bath mats reeked of mildew !
please do n't ruin your time in sin city with a place like this .
the worst hotels of all .
warning : they do n't clean the rooms very well .
i would never come back and would not recommend to anyone .
the person answering the phone was great , friendly , knew her stuff !
manager says credit only , will not except $ _num_ bill . ''
`` sorry , it is his call , not mine .
papa johns just lost a customer for life .
btw , i am in the food and beverage industry .
this is simply unacceptable .
terrible service !
the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
customer service is very poor as is their delivery speed and product .
so i called management and asked them to fix the problem .
i swear to god they must mess with people for fun here .
the cashier was very rude .
he just ignored me .
this place has ruined papa john 's for me .
the employees were lazy trailer trash and black folk .
the pizza was really terrible too .
it had hardly and cheese and toppings basically was just bread .
and actually just threw it away after heating it up because it was inedible .
i have stopped using this location and will not be using papa johns again .
the pizza product itself has been good but the service has always been mediocre .
i really should have read the reviews before ordering from here .
such a disappointment .
horrible customer service !
lights off , doors locked .
the pizzas that i wanted to order were n't there .
then everything is all half price .
after doing the process all over again , i placed my order .
but the line was cut off .
i told her that this is not the first time i ordered for delivery .
neither happened .
pizza was soggy and raw .
horrible customer service .
i 'm only reviewing based on me calling in and placing my order .
the guy on the phone was not friendly n was cut short .
she then told me my total was almost $ _num_ !
i arrived _num_ minutes later , they did not have it ready .
two and a half hours ?
what horrible customer service .
i have used _num_ papa rewards point since it started .
the pizza was so undercooked the cheese was still in chunks .
they said they 'd get here _num_ - _num_ minutes .
they did not call us to let us know they cancelled our order .
pizza is terrible ... .
too much cheese where is the pepperoni and bacon ?
papa johns is usually better than this .
i wish i could give this store no stars .
terrible because i really liked this jacket but no one to help me .
terribly long wait .
they just do n't give a damn .
rent somewhere else no matter how much it costs !
well over an hour to counter , then downstairs to pick up car .
then , when dropping car off , another long line .
very disappointing and not worth the reasonable rental rate .
after having dinner there , i do not want to go back again !
the service was terrible !
maybe it was only us , but there were many things wrong .
there was nothing really special about the dishes .
we sat near the window ... with barely a view of the strip .
for ambiance , i 'd give it _num_ stars .
ok , for a place this expensive , i do n't expect good .
and damn , it was n't good .
nothing to write home about .
the roasted duck was better ... although a little too rare for my taste .
but not worth _num_ bucks .
we skipped dessert because nothing sounded that appealing .
small portions !
the first time it was said because i had a dumb moment .
stupid me thought the restaurant would be at the very top of the tower .
what i was also hoping was that the food would be better .
it also was difficult to eat .
at least the french really know their desserts .
the view entirely depends on where they seat you , however .
also , the drinks are hella expensive and not too special .
we went for valentines and it was hell !
first , it was difficult to find the entrance to the restaurant .
not child friendly in that they ca n't do pasta or rice .
they also left the french fries out of the to go !
free cheese puff - but had rye in it ( i hate rye ! )
crazy expensive !
service was off on sunday pm .
did n't give us spoons for the soup .
did n't notice guest did n't have fork to eat dish .
it was $ _num_ for that brand martini .
i almost fell of the chair .
utterly ridiculous !
we were n't greeted by waiter , busboy , anyone for several minutes .
however the manager did apologize and remove it from the tab .
that was _num_ days ago and i 'm still not over it !
i had been in las vegas with my fianc this past labor day weekend .
i was extremely disappointed with the food .
once finished , i pressed my fianc for dessert .
after that , we did n't see our server for another _num_ minutes .
we pressed him for the check to leave as soon as possible .
i 've tried the steaks , fish , chicken and duck .
the dessert was the worst creme brulee i 've probably had anywhere .
food , would n't eat here again .
not worth the effort or the price .
over priced , i 've had much better french food elsewhere .
however , neither of our entrees were good .
no delicious dessert can make up for that sort of problem .
had to leave our show `` o '' early because of this food poisoning .
quality was only average at best .
the place has great ambiance : dark but not too dark .
there are very few `` bad '' tables .
but they all taste as if nobody in the kitchen has taste buds .
some bland some too salty ! )
the bread was not too bad .
was n't too impressed with the food though .
it was decent but too pricey for what it is .
i will not be coming back again .
eiffel tower restaurant it is .
if you decide to come here , do n't get the surf and turf .
way too overpriced for a small ass portion .
salads are obviously not fresh .
i ordered a fish , but it tastes awful !
he ordered a chicken , but he left _num_ % of them .
no vegetables at all on the dishes .
i do n't wan na go back even it 's free .
thank god i did not because the experience was ruined !
when we walked in was very crowded and no place to stand .
the quality of the beef ( we ordered filet ) was laughable .
someone else got food poisoning from the salmon dish .
not here .
each side dish will feed _num_ people , maybe .
the steaks and fish are served without any garnish .
nobody even ate it .
all in all it was a waste of money and calories .
it took _num_ hours to leave the restaurant !
one of the worst meal experiences of my life .
the view of the strip is not worth that kind of pain .
i must say that my experience was quite disappointing .
when we arrived we noticed other patrons in jeans , t-shirts and flip flops .
the food was not bad , not out of this world either .
i will not be returning .
he looked worse .
the food - i 'm sorry but it just was n't good .
obviously the people cooking it had no idea how to make it properly .
it 's just not that good and certainly not worth the prices .
the food is pretty mediocre all the way .
pricey , my dish was $ _num_ for black cod baked in a bag .
my dinner guest had short ribs , pretty small portions for $ _num_ .
but then again , you are paying for location and view .
probably be more like _num_ 1/2 stars as opposed to _num_ .
i actually ate there , have a receipt to prove it .
price was not small however .
eiffel also markets itself as having high dress standards , this is laughable .
for one , the menu is not very french .
that turned me off .
french toast is not french .
did not taste good .
gross .
our server was very quick to leave us .
the only reason the chicken was tasty was because there was aged parmesan .
and it looked like a giant flat pancake on my plate .
i paid $ _num_ for something i could make myself .
i hear there 's an eiffel tower las vegas tour .
the food is not worth it .
the menu is truly pedestrian with no imagination whatsoever .
the taste of the french bread was terrible !
the average entre price is $ _num_ .
salads are $ _num_ .
all the view in the world did n't make the dinner experience any better .
i must say i was really disappointed .
for a restaurant of this caliber , i would expect more courteous attitude .
you either tell me that no tables were available or change my time .
upscale restaurants would not let their patrons wait if they have a reservation .
most restaurants would do something special with our desserts , but not this one .
as for the food , the steak was ok but not worth $ _num_ .
at $ _num_ , i would expect better .
it was better , but nothing to write home about .
when we sat down , there was none .
my kids are _num_ and _num_ .
i just do n't get the high ratings from other yelpers .
do n't be fooled by the look of this place .
the food was bad , especially the lamb burger that i ordered for lunch .
the meat was too salty .
the taste of lamb was non-existent .
and the salad ... there were still dirt or spoiled leaves left .
totally unappealing .
my wife lost her appetite after a single bite .
yet no server came .
then the waiter appeared with _num_ pieces of candies .
terrible place to eat .
but i do need my dogs with me 24/7 .
and then he goes on saying well we only want service dogs .
unless you got $ $ $ to burn , go somewhere else .
like all strip restaurants it is way overpriced .
worst of all is the attitude of too m any of the staff .
there were only two choices for an appetizer : one soup or one salad .
the turkey was so , so with a tiny amount of boring gravy .
we were all so let down and we will never visit for thanksgiving again .
do n't bother .
we flew in from san diego and had dinner arranged there at _num_ .
when we arrived , sure enough there were plenty of tables .
it really ruined our love for this restaurant .
i 'm really disappointed .
_num_ the _num_ course meal was extremely limited .
only fish or beef ( not even steak ) were the main course .
_num_ the food felt too fancy and there was no substance to it .
the total bill was close to $ _num_ , for _num_ people .
of course _num_ % gratuity already included .
but i would n't come here just for the bread .
it was really a let down to come here .
i am really disappointed by my experience here last night .
however , i feel you can get that in other areas on the strip .
if i could have ordered an entire plate of those , i would !
big mistake .
and maybe , on a weekday night , that 's exactly what they are ?
then her pinot salmon was fishy because it was over cooked .
horrible customer service and will never go here .
my party was extremely disappointed and upset about our experience at dinner .
the server said that was fine and it would n't take that long .
during this wait time we did not even get checked up on !
so we waited another _num_ mins .
but whatever .
service overall was _num_ star .
the lunch took about an hour and _num_ minutes filled with errors .
20th anniversary lunch what a mess .
there is nothing special about it .
it is overpriced , the food is nothing special .
not much flavor and nothing special about the presentation .
that pretty much ruined my experience .
the whole dinner was nothing but a huge disappointment !
we made a reservation around sunset thinking it would be extra romantic .
i have to say this was no treat .
this one is not it .
my father bought _num_ glasses of wine at near _num_ per drop ha !
our bill was near _num_ for four .
save your money we wo n't be going back !
all in all this place is n't worth the price .
just came back from dinner there tonight .
this place is not one of them .
and i hated the christmas music .
ugh ... .
wish i had gone to the restaurant right below it ... ... .
however , there is no special touch added to these dishes .
place is not set up to give individual attention before being seated .
not exactly first class the elevator leaves you in the kitchen .
young women at reception are full of themselves and not very welcoming .
i sent back a soup that was supposed to be lobster based .
wine prices are ridiculous , even for lv .
walking through the now tacky paris hotel is not a great appetizer either .
first off , the service was terrible .
the bread was served cold .
for a little starter they served us cauliflower mousse .
it tasted even worse .
the green beans were okay but had a really sour after taste .
come for the view , maybe leave without food !
this last time however was an abysmal _num_ star .
it was crazy expense and worth every penny .
this meal had nothing negative to comment on .
next i had the worst , over vinegary , kale salad ever .
this salad was horrible , oh , and had _num_ tiny cherries ... .
this was just disappointing and sad .
hands down the worst foie i have ever had .
oh , and the duck prosciutto was as hard as glass .
i would have had dessert but my mouth was bleeding from the duck glass .
the reason why i gave it only _num_ stars was because of my meal .
the dish cost _num_ $ and they give you _num_ !
i made the mistake of not complaining .
this has to be the worst overpriced restaurant on the strip .
the service is horrible the food is okay ; nothing impressive .
the restaurant stinks i believe is overdue for a remodeling .
our experience here was mostly negative .
i go to paris quite often and they are much nicer .
totally bad service , and bad food !
this place is worse than many other restaurants !
not an offer to find us another spot nor asked us to wait .
nothing special about the service by the water .
$ _num_ deposit !
had 9:00 pm reservation ... finally was seated at 10:30 pm .
food was mediocre at best .
dinner for _num_ ... $ _num_ .
not worth the money .
i only gave it a _num_ because it was outrageously over priced .
you 're paying for the ambience and view here , not for the food .
only the food makes this a two star review .
the girls who worked at the check-in station looked very stressed and overwhelmed .
the food was very random .
ca n't recommend it and we are not coming back there for sure .
our wait time was over an hour with reservations .
_num_ courses were so overdone they could not be eaten .
the location of the table overlooked a wall , even with reservations .
i would never recommended this restaurant to anyone .
not overpriced american food and crappy french version of french soup .
we did n't eat here .
why pay for a view that you wo n't see ?
went here for lunch with a friend !
he just ignored us the entire time !
some items too hot , some room temp on the same plate .
our lovely romantic dinner on my birthday was turning into a disaster very fast .
not the case here : i had seabass that was dry .
everything else on the table tasted quite average .
while it sounded wonderful , it was lukewarm and lacked flavor .
i had the cod and my better half had the chicken .
sadly , the much anticipated souffl was poorly prepared and missed the mark .
bad service not a pleasant experience food was cold steak was dry no flavor .
was told it was $ _num_ for a rose was charge $ _num_ .
went there for my girlfriend 's birthday she was not happy with the service .
souffl was served with no side plates .
waited 10-15 minutes for the side plates to be brought out .
by that time the souffl was cold .
currently waiting another _num_ minutes for another souffl to be cooked .
not happy with the service or condition of the dinning area .
management is awful .
wanted to try this restaurant at lunch time with the hubby while in vegas .
the restaurant was n't even full and it was lunch time .
me : how long do i have to wait ?
can you guess where this is heading ?
horrible experience !
service is terrible and food is limited .
my duck was a bit bland to me .
my brothers got steak ( ribeye & filet mignon ) and it was ok .
my dinning experience was not as great coming from a high-end restaurant .
so i did n't eat them .
so awkward and really annoying .
this meal was a complete bummer .
those passion fruit jelly things are terrible .
thanks , but no thanks .
the manager on the other hand was ridiculous .
we had a work dinner here , and spent a lot of money .
_num_ times .
then our entres arrived and things went down hill fast .
then you know it is overdone . ''
service was extremely slow .
food was bland .
other than the view , i would n't recommend this place .
you can much better steaks for half the price elsewhere .
very disappointed in our table selection .
we had to have the worst booth here .
so , i was pretty disappointed .
i ordered the halibut , the presentation was beautiful but the fish was not .
it was very very dry and the outside was overlooked .
i eat fish 2-3 times a week and this was just ruined .
i ate it of course but this should 've been done perfectly .
the pork chop was over priced and very salty .
for _num_ people our bill was $ _num_ .
i was a little disappointed .
overpriced and food was mediocre .
was looking forward to a fantastic dining experience but was really disappointed .
food was n't anything amazing either .
the manager and the host are really rude .
she just say no and we ca n't change table .
unbelievable .
a little fishy to me !
may be my party look cheap for them .
i gave $ _num_ in tips which i never thought tips were already added .
only good things were server told that the tips is already added .
by the way that bill was only for appetizer and drinks .
this was ridiculous .
on top of it she was not at all apologetic for her mistake .
i really did n't like their hospitality plus they spoiled our anniversary dinner .
i would not come back here again unless the menu changed .
save your money for the real eiffel tower .
the restaurant does not cater to dietary restrictions .
want to have wine ?
if you are vegan , do n't even go here .
if you eat eggs , there are a few more options .
my boyfriend ordered the caesar and was very disappointed .
sadly , they lived up to an overpriced tourist trap .
the service and food was mediocre for the price point .
when the salad arrived , it have several large pieces of anchovies on top .
we had to flag down our waitress and get a basic salad replacement .
i choose the fish which was underwhelming but , i was hungry .
half price over this place .
the meat is not meat , but butter meat .
unbelievable .
the only saving grace was the king crab salad as the appetizer .
she said just to guarantee a random table .
very disappointed this time .
frankly , for the almost $ _num_ we paid , this experience was dismal .
go for a drink at bar , skip the dinner .
beware they charge _num_ % gratuity for parties _num_ or more .
very pricey , but the food was only so-so .
but i would not recommend this place .
( $ _num_ ) it was kind of bland .
nothing made it stand out .
a lot of money for a bland soup .
it was not succulent or tasty .
for $ _num_ , i expected something far more memorable .
or maybe _num_ of them .
it was very stressful .
i had a taste of the steak and it was dry .
i was so disappointed i wish we could have gone somewhere else .
i thought it was gross .
immediately lost appetite bagged up the food and gave to street artist .
also waitress just did not seem interested in giving us an experience .
terrible service from start to finish .
the waitress was very pushy .
not impressed at all with the hostesses and wait staff .
not worth it .
my family and i had an extremely disappointing experience at the eiffel tower restaurant .
the attention to service and detail was lost at eiffel tower restaurant .
my family and i were excited to sit near the fountains .
we also had a negative experience with our waitress .
throughout the evening , she did not come check up on us .
the only time when she was quick to service was giving us the bill .
this place was extremely overrated .
the main course was chicken , which i would not recommend to anyone .
overall i was very disappointed and would never go here again .
the _num_ star is for the food .
but i would recommend getting a dessert and wine and nothing else .
almost flavorless outside of some aged parm .
surf and turf burger - how you mess this up is beyond me .
very expensive and service was terrible .
talked with the host and he apologized and took off a couple sides .
do n't waste your time or money .
the overall experience left a sour note and was frankly disappointing .
will not be going back .
i did n't eat anywhere before this .
disappointing both times .
cold food , poor service .
the waiter was rude and never returned to see how the food tasted .
the majority of the food however , was terrible .
it was n't to my taste .
the view is priceless .
$ _num_ chicken was tasteless and hard to chew .
my husband ordered the king steak $ _num_ !
no sides just steak .
only option for beef wellington was medium , and it came out med well .
sorry , but this place is just a rip-off .
with tax , $ _num_ .
it was not worth it .
the worst onion soup i have seen for $ _num_ .
but skimpy spinach with a lousy tomato sauce .
not here .
cheese course on tasting menu was not offered .
manager had a terrible attitude .
the same at all .
leave this behind !
they do have pants and collar shirt yup loan at no charge .
the food was mediocre .
i was extremely disappointed in the eiffel tower restaurant !
sadly they seem to have lost their way .
after getting the manager 's approval to share a _num_ oz .
the timing of the food was terrible .
his scallops were cold .
it 's not as good as it smelled or looked .
i was never served chips and salsa during my whole visit .
the fajitas was salty like it was cooked in sea water .
to make matters worse there was a hair in the salsa .
so salty i could only eat a little and leave .
wo n't eat here again for breakfast .
i wish i had looked this up on yelp !
it 's fairly terrible .
this was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten at .
my wife had a stale tuna croissant .
she also received stale potato chips with half of them wet .
total waste of money and inedible .
deserves a zero , not a one .
but , the chicken smoker is solid , if not spectacular , airport food .
it 's gone seriously downhill , from a barely acceptable restaurant .
avoid at all costs !
what it is , is cheap quality and ground beef in everything .
rice and beans are bland , salads are just iceberg chopped lettuce .
vegas airport is yet to add descent food .
how can mess up on an omelette and potatoes ?
this place has awful food .
i ordered the denver omelette and it came with some potatoes and a biscuit .
i 'm usually a huge fan of biscuits but not these ones .
everytime i tried to put butter on it , it completely fell apart .
i 'm trying to find a way to give less than one star .
unbelievable .
it 'll run you _num_ bucks for a bottle of bud !
total damage this day ( _num_ persons ) $ _num_ .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
as i read the other reviews it looks like nothing has changed .
i paid my bill and walked out , never to return again .
what a waste of money !
avoid and go elsewhere !
the fries were average and edible though .
bad bad bad .
first they do n't have carne asada .
they charged me $ _num_ for _num_ tacos with rice and beans .
but an extra $ _num_ for watered down salsa mad the experience worse .
i will never eat here again because the food was disgusting .
their chocolate may be good , my wife or i will never know .
they had _num_ piece empty boxes .
was really looking forward to a good chocolate fix .
not here .
fool me once ... never again .
this is the only airline that has ever stolen from us .
unbelievable that this airline is still in business .
the worst airline of all-time .
water and gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert .
this is one expensive stop .
the gas here is very expensive .
tried a second unit , also full of stuff and nothing else available .
those comments are not appropriate for sunday service .
i wo n't be back .
played the sunrise & canyon _num_ 's the lakes was not offered to us .
this was our first and last time to visit this overrated course .
we had a bad staff experience as well .
the food is mediocre at best and overpriced .
anything really goes on the golf course , tennis courts and fitness center .
staff was horrible , greens not in the best condition !
i am a local and took three out of town guests to spanish trail .
next our 9:00 tee time was delayed over _num_ minutes .
the fairways have no grass and i 'm not exaggerating .
our next fun was paying over $ _num_ for a beer .
the lakes course was decent but the canyon should not even be open .
he said that we could for another $ _num_ per person .
i said i did n't think so and we will never be back .
i do n't feel anyone deserves to be treated like this .
do not recommend .
horrible customer service .
these people are rude and overpriced !
the ratio between student and teachers are too high .
i am just really dissappointed in how the school handled the situation .
really disappointed in this program .
i 'm very glad i went for a second visit that day .
cheap carpeting .
unit smells like mold and trash during the winter when windows are kept shut .
had major health problems over the past year .
management would not allow her to move out a month before lease was up .
slow turnaround when repairs needed .
notified management countless times that the water was a risk to children and pets .
no action was taken .
called management and they replaced it with another old one .
bottom line = look elsewhere for a rental .
all i can advise here is not to move into these apartments .
there 's truly nothing i can get here and nowhere else . )
this place is not worth the money and the headache .
in the past six months it certainly has changed for the worse .
where i once felt welcome , i no longer do .
not asking is everything ok , am i ok ?
they do n't care about people , only the money .
did not eat here .
the yelp coupon is there for a reason and a bad one at that .
paper signs let you know the extremely weird hours of operations .
pizza was gross .
i called the restaurant and they tried to blame bite squad .
well , bite squad did not prepare the food .
the fries were cold and hard , pretty sure they were frozen and microwaved .
i miss carlos kitchen that used to be in this location .
wo n't be ordering again .
very upset and disappointed .
half hour to take our order then another _num_ minutes for the food .
burgers were way undercooked and missing ingredients .
portions small for he price .
smoke coming in fri the bar next door .
will not be back .
avoid !
she became very defensive and rude !
i left there so frustrated and annoyed .
drove it for a mile it started making noise again .
i took it back , they kept my vehicle for _num_ 1/2 days .
after day _num_ of no eating i knew i had to do more .
unfortunately that was n't the case as i saw it last night .
the food was mediocre .
why would n't they inform him of that when he ordered it ?
made for very slow service .
this place was pretty disgusting .
could 've been all microwaved .
i would not recommend this place to the homeless ... .
i ordered the ayce catfish and can honestly say the fish was awful !
is that too much to ask ?
everyone that was eating there was miserable .
it was disgusting .
huge mistake !
i took one bite , it was the worst thing i have ever eaten .
while there i ate _num_ shrimp and a few clam strips .
please never eat there , it is a horrid experience .
there is no hole in the wall appeal here .
ive been a million times to this fish shack .
omg its old but you just happen to open _num_ minutes ago .
the baked potato was hard and not done .
two groups in there .
gross !
totally void of flavor .
this trip , i was sorely disappointed .
they get a `` _num_ '' for the front of the house !
just disgusting .
they 've lost a customer .
dirty , unorganized and poorly managed store .
take a cue from my mom since you apparently learned nothing from your own .
a gentleman sat down to do my paint .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
it seem she hated life all together smh never coming back here again .
will not go back or recommend this place at all !
ick !
we ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp , the empanadas and _num_ chili relleno plate .
empanadas were not hot all the way thru .
i do not think we will be trying this place again .
this place is in a really ghetto area .
_num_ minutes away from the strip .
i kinda wish there were negative stars .
now _num_ days later my money is still not in my account .
this mcdonald 's drive thru lines are the slowest i 've been in .
i tried to do a split payment of cash and card for a transaction .
he was acting strange so i checked my receipt to see what he did .
i then checked my account to be sure .
this is where the perks end .
it may be slightly more expensive , but it is much more safe .
i 'm not joking .
wrong .
did it validate why i wanted to leave in the first place ?
the name of this place should be called eagle trash .
i would n't reccommend this place to anyone unless it was your last resort .
very bad .
i do n't care about that really though .
the staff is questionable .
people are loud .
i hate this place and ca n't get out fast enough !
it 's so bad and the treatments are n't working ... .
since we had already moved i was not at the property at that point .
when i went by that morning the office was not open .
they did n't open until an hour after i had to be at work .
they simply said no .
no explanation no nothing .
a couple of months later they sent me a bill for _num_ days rent .
apparently they were now charging me to redo the apartment .
this was _num_ months later .
the moving in process was fine .
she simply brushed off the incident as if it happened all the time .
mike in the office said no .
honestly i was n't calling for the lock changing process .
they did n't do a damn thing .
there is dog crap everywhere , because nobody picks up after their dogs .
i had already been moved out _num_ days by then .
she ended up in the emergency room for the night .
pest control seems to have no effect .
we were not shown our actual apartment before we signed the lease .
they took electronics , personal info , and my dog went missing !
if you have a family this is not a good place to move .
that is not the case .
# _num_ the dining room windows do not open .
scorpions can be bad here .
# _num_ be ready to pay $ _num_ for anything .
$ _num_ loose a key to your apartment ?
security is a joke and front office people are a joke .
your not safe here .
kids are loud are all over the place .
i almost ran like _num_ over .
overall i would not recommend it to anyone .
worst ever !
said they do not keep records and it was our loss .
i purchased the sunday drive for my fiance ' s birthday last week .
after all he only wears a 2x .
i felt so bad .
frankly another driver that day who was six foot four said he barely fit .
mark stated if anything went wrong to call him on his cell phone .
_num_ hours later the pilot light was out after taking a shower .
then _num_ days later same problem !
called them , delayed coming out for _num_ days .
horrible product , even worse customer service !
then , she tells me the service window is anytime from 7am to 5pm !
the bill was $ _num_ !
i received no credit for the old tank core .
i have since learned the `` water tank is bad '' is a scam .
some lame excuses .
if they care , they should be doing something about all these negative reviews .
this was not explained to me when i signed my contract for the system .
i am sorry i ever used their services .
their next appointment was a week away .
so i had to call them back trying to request a better time .
the service call is $ _num_ for them to show plus parts and labor .
so sick of them .
i would not do business with them if i had any choice .
horrible !
i would choose _num_ zero stars if that were an option .
so , that was an additional $ _num_ for a small plastic piece .
so , it cost us over $ _num_ this time around .
i 'm sure because the unit is only $ _num_ .
terrible service .
i mean truly awful .
confused yet ?
me too , because i did n't get the pizza .
unfortunately this establishment had something else in mind and sent me a calzone instead .
for a calzone as a whole , i 've had some awesome ones .
it was n't small either ; quite a bonus .
horrible customer service .
besides the store is about _num_ minutes away .
we have ordered approximately _num_ times from this restaurant for delivery .
poor customer service .
you lost a loyal customer tonight .
worst phone etiquette i 've ever experienced .
and the red rock location is n't any better .
hung up on me and spoke horribly to me with foul language .
rude and disrespectful .
really really really gross and very rude staff along with really high prices .
robertos is disgusting .
even when i 'm drunk it 's still gross .
more like a american place trying to be mexican .
the staff is really slow , they do n't pay attention to orders .
overall the inside looks dirty , just like the one on easter ave .
the cashiers at this location do n't know what they are doing !
first of all , that 's rude !
and three where the hell is customer service !
worst place ever .
really and her attitude was the worst .
they need to train ppl basic customer service skills .
nasty attitude to go along with filthy restaurant .
should have never stopped .
it has meat and guac and salsa .
really ... ... $ _num_ for a spoon full of rice and beans ?
it does n't get any cheaper than rice and beans folks ... .
onions and tomatoes come together as pico de gallo .
a mexican restaurant without onions ?
rude , slow and then they started talking about me in spanish .
only robertos i have been too that is not clean .
ridiculous .
if i could leave them a negative star i would !
i hate that all robertos are different .
she straight up said no .
you 're making money off of me .
would n't even let me just buy some chorizo .
i was really disappointed with the meal .
the burger and chilli did n't compliment each other .
cash only , `` i could n't find a letter '' .
very bad service and food was absolutely horrible .
mistake dirty , unfriendly and just basic cooking easy breakfast skills lacking .
just do n't go .
neighborhood around the park is less than desirable .
it 's so urine soaked it 's disgusting .
free internet is not free .
i should have got a tip for waiting so long and so patiently .
i would give this place zero stars if i could !
first call i was on the line _num_ minutes and was hung up on .
needless to say , i will never order form pizza hit ever again !
crappy customer service !
i wish i can give this place _num_ stars .
the employees are super rude and have horrible customer service .
i will defiantly not order from this place ever again .
are you kidding , how am i suppose to eat my pasta .
you could have atleast warned me before i ordered pasta .
but that encounter was ridiculous .
at this point , i might as well gone to little caesars .
her car is a one owner clear title excellent running car with low miles .
never been smoked in , never been in an accident .
not true !
never ever try to sell your car at co part !
i asked to speak to a supervisor and she was extremely rude as well .
she never apologized for my inconvenience or for the mistakes on their end .
she had no response and put me on hold .
they were a complete hassle and their customer service is awful .
do n't trust this place .
if i had better pizza delivery places to choose from ... i would .
awful customer service.
will not order from here again .
not good .
bad service !
i should 've listened to myself .
we have to wait for _num_ to _num_ min for the food .
my husband and i said we were n't coming back to this location again .
employees were terrible .
prices on drive-thru menu are lower than the prices they ring up .
just had to have price corrected again .
sad sad way too treat your customers .
( they 're already expensive ! )
jesse is completely rude !
this is ridiculous !
customer service is just not available in most places these days .
he received full payment and the vehicle was not delivered to me until saturday .
no integrity .
my problem is with the security and not the events held there .
race starts , security doesnt tell anyone to move now .
would not give me the name .
so in short , because of this guy .
i understand safety and have no problem with it .
boring , boring , boring , as usual .
ai n't nothing you can do .
not really much to write about !
my vehicles and number of are within the rules .
seems like there should be more to this story , does n't there ?
that was _num_ days ago and still not fixed .
in my mind , if it happens once , it 's a mistake .
first time , guy tried to charge me soda price for water .
be aware folks , pay attention to what you pay these thieves !
it took _num_ hours and _num_ minutes just to leave the parking lot .
the vegetables were dry and tasteless .
it was a shame because i so love turkey and mashed potatoes .
something really weird was going on the week we were there .
worst service i have ever had !
i made a reservation over the phone three weeks prior to my stay .
nothing changed so i was at easy .
i was running behind schedule so i just took a glance at the bill .
without a doubt the worst stay i have ever had anywhere !
musty smell everywhere .
lost about $ _num_ worth of items , maybe more .
this place sucks really bad .
it 's dingy i would not recommend this place at all .
please do n't eat here .
this place is always empty .
after paying $ _num_ i proceeded to wait .
rangoon were cold and not good .
now the spicy almond chicken was very bland and no flavor to it .
i will not be back .
but restaurants are n't just about food .
after a _num_ minute wait , we were seated .
from the looks of the crowd , this was average for that lunch service .
well it 's almost _num_ am , so why should n't they be .
i know fishy when i smell it , and this place was fishy .
so many bad things , i ca n't even think of where to start .
horrible experience .
i have definitely stayed at worse hotels .
that said , it was pretty bad .
+ it was cheap .
+ parking was free .
- the website also says they have free wifi .
lots of dust , stains , etc .
i hate to even think why .
lots of seedy looking characters walking around at night .
wifi connection sucks , and is super slow .
this is so dangerous because everyone can see all my belongings .
i could n't change in the room or everyone would see .
dirty , nasty , scary .
wo n't stay there ever again .
the worst place i have ever stayed .
our non-smoking room had clearly been smoked in ... several times .
would have gone somewhere else but we prepaid and had already driven _num_ hours .
really bad hotel and really bad .
they did give us _num_ regular and _num_ face towels after i complained .
about _num_ miles from the strip .
your typical super _num_ , only with less towels .
it had all the most basic needs , beds , coffee maker , tv .
the gal who checked me in did not speak english .
the room was clean and the ac worked .
worthless hotel .
rooms are not bright , no light , no fridge , no microwave .
do not waste money here .
i knew to keep my expectations low .
the problem is n't necessarily the hotel it 's the clientele it attracts .
do n't take my word for it.
the worse paella i have ever tasted .
this would n't be necessary if they improve the quality of their food .
zero stars
negative _num_ stars if i could ; this place is awful !
naturally it hurt like hell and i started bleeding .
she did n't even notice .
`` rude , rude , rude ! ''
i too agree that this place is a `` no go ! ''
she was rough with my feet and rude .
i gave no tip for that crappy service !
earlier .
this place is terrible !
the wait to get my eyebrows done was _num_ minutes !
if you live in las vegas , never stop here .
are you kidding me ?
the experience was terminal to terminal and was fine .
i called to locate our truck and and no one knew who i was .
our truck just sat in nevada for _num_ days waiting to be delivered .
save yourself the headache and damaged furniture .
other action would be needed on my part .
they replaced the fuel filter .
what a nightmare .
_num_ year customer never returning !
i was highly disappointed with this place .
the first definitely is n't true and the second apparently is n't either .
we said , `` oh , no thank you we are just looking . ''
then he said , `` well then why are you wasting my time ? ''
if i could give them zero stars i would .
a few days passed and never received a return call .
it 's been a week and a half and have not heard a thing .
maybe small jobs are not worth their time ?
do n't waste your time if you are a single home owner .
we contacted them and asked for an estimate and never received one .
once we responded residential , the manager had no time for us .
hmmm ... i called for an estimate but no thank you now .
do n't waste your time if you are a single home owner .
we contacted them and asked for an estimate and never received one .
once we responded residential , the manager had no time for us .
hmmm ... i called for an estimate but no thank you now .
what a waste of time .
i wo n't be going back to that dealership ever again .
no integrity !
twice they broke a rim and once lost one of my center caps .
we could n't sit in a single vehicle to check it out .
pretty pathetic visit to a new car dealership .
terrible !
this place has consistently slow service .
would not return if i did n't have to get mandatory service .
emailed about availability of _num_ vehicles _num_ .
i was to come down with my trade in to get a new vehicle .
that he had made a mistake .
apparently , he did n't get that .
do not let centennial toyota salesman push you into a bad deal .
save your self money , and do n't go there .
it took them _num_ hours to change the oil and rotate the tires .
oscar said the car was out of warranty but i could contact toyota directly .
he wasted everyone 's time and made a false statement to toyota !
waiting to hear from toyota but i 'm sure our claim will be denied .
do n't go to this location .
so what exactly does a bumper to bumper , manufacturer warranty cover ?
they tell me no , it is only mechanical ?
he 's horrible he tried to sell me everything possible .
do n't recommend this guy at all .
the worst salesman i have ever met !
the service person told me after _num_ hours that the claim was denied .
very disappointed in the service .
i will never buy a toyota again .
anyway i do n't care for your service .
all of these things i mentioned are lacking at centennial toyota .
all of this is mediocre service .
i knew they were worn out but i didnt know they were that bad .
he also told me that this kind of damage didnt happen overnight .
why would you rotate the tires if their already that bad ?
if i could give _num_ star , i would !
made appointment for saturday morning to have check engine light looked at .
completely unacceptable level of service .
friendly people but lacking in service focus .
can not recommend this place to anyone .
do n't go to this dealership .
thank god i never have to deal with centennial toyota ever again !
centennial toyota sales department is a joke .
they are the worst bunch of salespeople in the city of las vegas .
do n't trust them and i 'll never purchase from them again .
my recent experience at toyota was less than pleasant though .
it was a big waste of time .
with signing and everything it took about _num_ hours total .
centennial later sent me an email after i told them my disappointment .
that 's completely missing the point .
it 's safe to say my loyalty with this place is completely gone .
probably , since buying a car is all about playing these games .
there is no loyalty , at least not with what happened to me .
the service representative quoted me $ _num_ .
i put my husband on the phone and suddenly my bill was $ _num_ ?
you can not trust these guys at all !
very dishonest place , especially the service dept .
response to my review was nothing but crap .
i sent him _num_ emails to resolve issue .
_num_ days later , they say it will be _num_ or _num_ $ .
however , after calling the dealership they assured me it was legit .
no thanks .
honesty is not part of their business , skip them !
the worst people working here .
and the payment is fixed for _num_ years !
omg they charged me $ _num_ to replaced the alternator .
i could not adjust the seat for the test drive .
not trustworthy at all .
what a horrible person to deal with .
in my own words : he was stupid .
he is telling me toyota has n't received another toyota _num_ runner ?
i would n't recommend this place or this people .
it was n't worth it .
the cashier is the only reason i did n't give this place one star .
she offered me some advice on the warranty and sent me on my way .
why could n't centennial toyota do the same ?
i sent him several emails and he never responded once .
i am angry for the incompetent work , i am angry for ignoring me .
i 'm still dealing with this place as i write this .
they also came back and said , no problem ... they will do it .
somehow it is done incorrectly twice , and counting .
horrible , horrible service .
the guy did n't even seem apologetic .
manny never met me so i went looking for him .
manny then says he has to wash it real quick .
this is my 2nd time getting an oil change and i 'm disappointed .
my first oil change was done at the sahara location with no problems .
i will not be attending this service center anymore .
these guys literally did not want to sell me a car .
the online department refused to answer questions .
but that 's another long story .
if i could give no star that would be more of an accurate review .
do not buy a vehicle from centennial toyota .
this dealership practices deceptive sales techniques .
never again will i consider buying a vehicle from this dealership .
there was no mention of the extra $ _num_ .
it turns out , they do change the information before printing .
no mention of a trade in , whatsoever .
the first problem i encountered was with sal in the financial department .
this place is a joke .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
do not go here you will be sorry and big waste of your time .
go anywhere else but here to buy a toyota .
i guess i was dumb enough to go for that .
what a horrible experience at centennial toyota .
the manager asks me what i would pay for this car .
someone was lying .
no we want that car .
the manager also said they he could n't work with my price .
guess where we are buying our car .
i purchased a truck back in _num_ .
`` why would you not close the deal today ?
i just wan na know . ''
`` so you are going to pit one dealership against another . ''
that i was going to pit one dealership against another , by shopping around !
they did not put gas in the car .
it turns out that the two rear tires are bad .
sorry to bother you via social media .
three days later i was told my car door was fixed .
that fix was going to cost us $ _num_ .
um ... no thanks !
$ _num_ saved .
my husband was suspicious because we know the vehicle was never in an accident .
so , my husband asked to take the old parts home .
not the slightest mark on it .
we are toyota people .
this was a big mistake .
it was just all a waste of my time .
`` do n't go to this dealership '' .
still i have n't received an email or phone call from anthony .
no return call .
still no call back .
she does n't have an appointment with me .
my next car would have been a toyota or lexus , but not anymore .
i want to get as far away from this dealership as i can .
little did i know that it would soon turn into a total nightmare .
i purchased the tire and wheel platinum plus protection plan .
they could n't find the protection plan on my records .
since it was a _num_ dollar repair , i was n't too upset .
i 'm like whatever .
it 's too much hassle for a small repair .
it only covered replacement .
like i said before , i have my contract .
toyota are great , this dealership is not !
the worst dealership experience i ever had .
this place is an absolute joke .
needless to say i walked off .
how much did they suggest for a monthly payment at first ?
nearly $ _num_ .
they were taking us for a ride , and not in their vehicles .
whether you are a veteran or not , please stay away from centennial toyota .
this was a terrible experience to have put my family through .
my recommendation is to just avoid the place period .
`` i already have a loan , i do n't want yours . ''
he was trying to talk me into buying a cheaper version of the car .
i walked out and drove all the way to findlay in henderson .
completely disappointing experience .
would highly suggest you try findlay first !
worst attempt at buying a car i have ever had .
take the _num_ min extra drive and go to auto nation toyota on sahara .
no bs back and forth .
much less than centennial toyota .
i have had _num_ bad experiences with this toyota dealership .
i walked out and decided that a car was n't worth that effort .
the warranty recall even states that it can split for any reason .
apparently this dealership did n't read that portion .
i feel like it is just a scam to waste people 's time .
it was very disappointing to have driven all that way for nothing .
this is probably why people choose carmax .
they do n't play these games .
my wife and i live _num_ minutes from this dealership .
the gm did not respond to any of my emails .
this was my first experience at a car dealership and it was absolutely terrible .
the lady helping me pressured me so much .
instead i went to findlay toyota the next day just to look .
but that 's not the worst part .
but that 's not the worst part .
do not go to this place .
why did i have to spend a good 10-15 min explaining our decision .
we will never return to this place .
they do not care about customer service whatsoever .
all i can say is avoid this place at all costs !
did i mention everything in their service center is 30-40 % overpriced ?
i still have not received credit for it .
only giving _num_ star bc i 'm required to choose _num_ .
no complaints there .
i was told `` sorry , that is too late '' .
i wish i would have gotten his name because he was great .
he tells me to come into his office and literally says nothing to me .
anyway , i thank him for fixing it and walk over to my car .
i ended up just driving away and fixing it myself at a gas station .
zero stars for this place !
would recommend to never go here ever .
they do n't give a shit about helping you with exactly what you want .
this place is beyond a nightmare .
do n't go to this dealership !
unfortunately .
it 's only been _num_ months .
not pleased with my experience at centennial toyota .
i should never have accepted the car , again my mistake .
i trusted this is signed the paperwork .
did you not notice this issue on the paperwork ?
yet this service was not done .
this is second poor service .
i am disappointed .
my issue was with the door damage .
just make sure you inspect your car before taking delivery , lesson learned .
this would cost $ _num_ .
this confirmed it was overlooked when they initially `` inspected '' it .
needless to say that did not happen .
instead they offered me $ _num_ toward a trade in .
thanks for wasting my time .
i am taking my car elsewhere to get serviced .
wish i could give this zero stars !
this company takes no responsibility for anything .
sales guy comes back in and tries to justify it .
however they continue to disappoint me every time i visit there .
they are clearly the worst toyota dealership in town .
this dealership is such a joke .
i would give it zero stars if that were even possible .
do n't waste your time !
i would avoid doing business with this dealership at all cost .
we are so disappointed in the sales personnel at centennial toyota !
i questioned that ( is n't that ridiculous ? )
they gave us our deposit back .
are you freakin kidding me ?
i had my babies with me so i could n't sit down inside .
that i did n't want to go inside and make a deal .
never gave me any numbers ... .
even embarrassing to to be treated like that in front of my fiance .
service was horrible and the sales person was a word i wo n't say .
he refused to give us my keys back to leave .
should n't this be something they could look up right away ?
too bad you ca n't give negative stars .
but no !
customers do n't matter and your hard earned cash is not valued .
do waste your time .
i will not return to this business ever .
worst car dealership ever .
this is the worst car dealership in the state .
the service people are very nice but nice does n't make it right .
i called several times to the manger no call back !
they lost my business of ever buying from them again !
the employees are super friendly but the product just is n't up to par .
you are better off going to the regular walker store & buying new .
there is a low selection of anything that could be considered modern .
seems like they do n't want to sell anything here .
what we found was $ _num_ !
i was transferred to a number with no answer .
fries were overcooked and dry .
when it came out , we were pretty disappointed .
additionally , it was extremely greasy and over cooked .
additionally , there were barely a handful of fries with the meal .
the chicken was very overdone and dry .
my wife 's meal was also disappointing .
there were only _num_ ribs .
they were moderately sized and slightly overdone as well .
there are better choices for steakhouses in town with better food for comparable prices .
did n't get plates for the appetizer .
the restaurant was n't busy , most tables were empty when we left .
was extremely disappointed with the service i received at this outback !
i had to send my drink back because it was n't made correctly .
the waiter would walk by and leave empty plates and cups on the table .
take out order was wrong .
this place is mediocre at best .
now not good .
the last four times we were here it was n't good in anyway .
the service from the moment we walked in the door was bad .
then the steak was way over cooked ( i ordered medium ) .
the fries were over cooked and crunchy .
they were terrible .
i 'm so disappointed .
eater beware this place is no good anymore .
i could n't even eat my food it was really nasty .
not worth the money for crappy food , never going back .
this place could n't cook a steak if it was cooked for them .
the _num_ of us that dined here would never go back .
the steak is not good there and tough .
gee i guess we should 've asked other 's first before going .
french fries looked soggy like they were sitting in a bin for a while .
to their credit they comped the desert .
bottom line ... not going back there again .
steakhouse were you ca n't get steak right does n't make sense .
bad idea .
the shrimp appetizer we ordered was sad .
my mom 's chicken breast was dry as well .
prices are higher and food is worse .
another one they offered in exchange was not much better .
poor service !
cold appetizers ( frozen ) lack luster attitude from staff .
will not come back !
alice springs chicken cost $ _num_ or $ _num_ at one time .
this place is horrible .
from the minute we walked in , no one really acknowledged us .
horrible place , no we will not return .
horrible service .
horrible .
deserves zero stars but i 'm forced to leave one .
i ordered 2x recently , disappointed twice .
i ended up threw 1/2 rack away .
do n't know if i want to go back any time soon .
it took the waitress _num_ minutes before she approached our table .
the complete order was wrong .
and then say , `` sorry it 's chicken , it that okay ?
we will never return to this outback .
since i 've been eating healthier i have n't been to outback .
the mushrooms and blooming onion were so salty i could n't eat them .
but this location has terrible costumer service .
he did n't even say hi to us .
the restaurant was pretty empty being _num_ in the afternoon on a monday .
we were sitting for _num_ minutes and still no server .
we ended up grabbing our menus and sitting in the bar area instead .
the manager walked by a few times ignoring us too .
still no service at this time .
when we had already waited about _num_ minutes after ordering .
my boyfriend ended up sending his steak back .
our service the time before was even worse than this .
this takes so long to listen to - please stop this !
your waitress did n't like doing it either .
we got seated right away but the service after that was slow .
will not go back again .
just not happy about our food tonight .
for $ _num_ there are many better places to get a good steak .
our dinner was awful !
it was such a disappointment .
we do not eat out often and was really looking forward to it .
i worked here years ago and the chicken never looked like that .
just really disappointed with our $ _num_ chicken !
we do n't much anymore , but tonight thought we would .
well that was a major mistake ... .
_num_ ) learn to be a waitress .
_num_ ) do you not like a tip ?
_num_ ) really ?
these where burnt and dry for the most part .
he was very disappointed with his meal .
we will not be returning to this outback again .
the seats are uncomfortable for sitting as long as a movie .
the movie did not start on time .
the prices for concessions are comparable to any in town .
not a fan of this place .
red rock is about a mile away , cheaper and far more comfortable .
i go here only when absolutely necessary .
the popcorn we get here ( _num_ year apart ) was stale .
older theatre , not really a true stadium seating .
if it were not for the restaurants here i would never go here .
no respect for customers .
$ _num_ compared to others that charges $ _num_ .
in la its $ _num_ or a lot more , ca n't complain .
on the bright side , this theater is extremely close to where i live .
got here and was lucky to have a nearly empty theater .
ugh !
inappropriate comments , lackluster skills , poor grooming .
so a sad experience was had .
very slow moving line just to buy tickets .
should n't they be fully stocked and ready to rock the weekend ?
very disappointed .
this theatre has gone downhill .
i do n't even know why they have seats there .
did n't expect to see a church giving service in the movie theater .
during the movie the sound went out and back in a couple of times .
this was my first and last experience at this regal .
this theater is awful .
i hate this theater , it is always like this .
poor service today !
upon finishing our lunch we waited for _num_ minutes to get our bill .
we ate here last night and i will never go back .
the restaraunt was somewhat busy , but nothing too crazy .
maybe only half full .
the waiter , although very nice guy , was very slow and seemed overwhelmed .
service is just way too slow at that place .
very bad food old not fresh chicken fajitas were terrible .
the margarita chicken burrito bad too .
very bad place .
price too high service quality bad .
when my drink is empty i consider it a bad thing .
i 'm sorry that 's not good in my book .
i 'm sitting here right now and am receiving terrible service .
the chicken tasted fake , it was slimy and had a weird texture .
the watermelon lemonade was not refreshing , it taste like fountain lemonade and syrup .
however , the chips and salsa were great !
we ate here around 2pm today .
these seem like an awful idea .
our food was very slow to come out .
my wife 's food was cold when it finally came out .
the quality of the chicken was quite poor too .
it was not really the server 's fault .
not here .
bad food .
bad service .
no way to pay cash for bill anymore apparently .
well i did n't get to eat my dinner .
lost my appetite after finding a hair in my food .
went on a sunday around 3pm .
at least my beer was poured well .
service is slow & there is almost no one here .
probably wo n't return .
very unhappy will not go to chili 's when she is working as bartender .
i ca n't imagine this place being the most sanitary after that .
many people looked at me , but i was n't acknowledged by anyone .
she said , oh i 'm sorry .
she never actually stepped on to the dining room floor .
once an experience starts in this way , it is difficult to turn around .
big fail today .
only gave it the _num_ stars that i did because my salad was good .
ordered _num_ main courses , two fried rice , and one noodles .
we will not be back .
man , did i have another thing coming .
which is a shame , because the folks at chop chop wok are friendly .
they provide stellar customer service .
we 're sorry , chop chop wok .
i am not in the habit of giving that out for some eggrolls .
quite simply put , i was worried while waiting for my food .
i did not notice when i first walked in that the place was filthy .
tables do n't wipe themselves .
wrong .
as for the food , i ordered from the japanese side for a change .
do n't get me wrong .
just not what i would expect .
and more of the sauce would have been nice too .
i got some sushi from here and it was horrible !
do n't bother buying sushi from here !
has to be the worst chinese delivery ever !
_num_ minutes still sitting here waiting for food .
i would n't even give it a star !
chinese food is disgusting .
worst mistake !
not special .
the chicken skewers is a sweet teriyaki which i did not prefer .
the only good thing here was the mongolian beef .
wanted to like this place but unfortunately wo n't return .
once we started to eat things became worst .
the flavors were very bland and the veggies tasted soggy and stale .
the orange chicken is pure batter and the beef and broccoli was under cooked .
heading to china a go go to get saturday night dinner .
i know all the big banks are pathetic .
i would give them all _num_ stars , if possible .
no more !
but _num_ w sahara is the worst of the worst .
and then she walked away .
the loan officer david jordan kept giving us closing dates and then blowing them .
i 'd go somewhere else .
mistake after mistake .
no communication .
blamed me for the difficult process .
they have all , on multiple occasions over promised and under delivered .
if you are a first time home buyer , stay away .
never before did he tell me this till _num_ days before closing .
the only issue was that they couldnt close till _num_ days later .
the title person even said that it is really strange .
i submitted my documents promptly .
here we are in april and we still have not closed .
i work in dirt , cant have fingers with cuts .
so they didnt want my blood , no problem .
i said i have my id but my son does n't .
do n't let bad people mess up a good organization .
how disappointing !
taking two hours past the appointment time is just way too long .
staff is friendly but that wait time sucks .
sam still would not eat .
sam was put to sleep on the saturday after thanksgiving .
you wait for hours , even with an appointment .
the other doctors there do not want to do anything for you .
they act like they are trying to save the insurance companies money .
they make you wait forever , then rush you out .
avoid this place if at all possible .
the worst was i had a piece of metal in my eye .
gave me antibiotics and sent me home .
could have lost my eye sight .
worst manicure i 've ever received .
um , is n't this your job ?
that _num_ minute drive there and back is n't so bad !
i thought my pedicure was okay but it looked like i did it myself .
i was disappointed with my pedi .
the salon appears clean but clearly there is something going on .
so today i gave this place another chance .
had to try ny style pizza anywhere outside of the ny metro area .
i walked out without my food and i am very unhappy with them .
the worst pizza we ever had - period !
the crust is thick and ny style is thin !
the driver was very rude !
so _num_ medium pizza 's with one topping each cost $ _num_ !
in vegas this is the closest ny style pizza places i 've ever had .
horrible customer service .
no fountain drinks .
not a chance .
had been craving some pepperoni pizza all day and came across manhattan pizza .
whoa , this place is uneven .
or maybe they had a really bad night .
i 've ordered takeout from them several times , usually the the eggplant parmesan .
if you take pride in your product you never send a bad order out .
that night i was sick beyond belief .
they were either undercooked or were left out for too long or something .
do n't get me wrong , food is decent but unsanitary .
and no soda fountain machine , only a cooler with cans and bottled drinks .
staff had no personality , either .
pretty run of the mill bad pizza .
but the place was clean and the guy behind the counter seemed ok .
how this place could call themselves manhattan pizza is beyond me .
to even attempt to associate themselves with the pizza capital is false advertising .
$ _num_ dollars in material and _num_ minutes for $ _num_ ?
this was hands down the worst pizza i have ever had ever !
seriously , you can get a better pizza at chuck e cheese !
he said , you think i want to take your money ?
you want your money back ?
worst customer service ever !
tonight ordered pizza for delivery .
hour and a half later no pizza and no phone call .
they finally called us back and told my husband they could n't find us .
he gave same directions again .
he said making new pizza and husband gave wrong address .
i asked for half off price he said no way .
staff was rude so i grabbed a menu and left .
wo n't be ordering from here .
horrible customer service .
after waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up .
i waited for _num_ minutes before they took my order .
horrible customer service .
the food here is way over priced .
the pizza is mediocre .
maybe i would have thought the food was better if i received better service .
my pie was ready , but i was not offered any cheese or peppers .
they have many specials online , so check that out prior to ordering !
but i would have to say that the garlic parmesan was mediocre .
there was melted cheese on top and i could n't even taste that .
ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section .
the pasta itself was mushy , really mushy .
the cheese had no flavor again , it was almost fake tasting .
lettuce as meh , but what got me is the ranch was gross .
it 's not gross , but it 's similar to little caesar 's .
it 's like a half step above a little better .
has a thick , chewy crust and generic sauce .
almost everything was horrible that we ordered !
it went straight to the trash .
the baklava and cheesecake were ok.
we wo n't be ordering again .
and the fried ravioli was just overpowering pepper .
i will not order from here ever again .
almost _num_ dollars is ridiculous for the quality of food and one actual plate .
however the chicken fingers smelled and tasted of old oil .
poor security .
very crappy kitchen and appliances .
i called _num_ mins past appt time .
no apology , only excuses .
i also have noticed random key scratches on other cars too .
the communication in the office is horrible .
ca n't walk anywhere without stepping in dog poop .
but guess what ?
this place is horrible !
wrong !
something is really wrong with this place .
it actually takes days maybe a week getting them to your apartment .
maintenance tried to walk out with my stuff .
not happening !
they know once a contract is signed , it 's signed .
and their water is turned off seriously every other week for repairs .
you 're an apartment leasing assistant manager , have a better attitude .
i just moved in and already i 'm unhappy .
its disgusting and in my opinion an unsafe environment to live in !
$ _num_ for a _num_ bed _num_ bath !
overall i would not recommend renting from this place .
negative rating due to office staff .
i walked out and will not be returning .
total for my basic blood tests now in the neighborhood of $ _num_ .
absolutely no acknowledgement of what i requested .
my original appointment was at the beginning of october _num_ .
i will not go back here and be treated this way again .
two weeks later , referrals had not been submitted .
at this second appointment i was assured the referrals would be submitted .
waited again , referrals never submitted per my insurance company .
of course he told me no , because they had never been submitted .
very poor medical care and very poor customer service .
would not recommend this medical group .
they will tell you to go to urgent care .
i do n't even know where to start .
the only nut he tested me on was peanuts which showed up .
clearly the entire office does not have their things together .
i have never in my life met a more careless doctor then him .
all of these issues caused a lot of confusion and stress for my grandmother .
and the scheduling department is even worse .
so inconsiderate for peoples time .
the wait time is what i thought by far was the worst .
you should always add an extra _num_ hours to your stay at her office .
they seem to triple book patients just to rush them through the door .
we also had the pharmacy call the doctor _num_ times to get my refills .
both her and her staff have ignored the calls from them as well .
it was also just a blood draw .
the doctor needed to sign off on something and was n't even there yet .
imagine if i showed up an hour late for my appointment .
i 've already changed doctors with my insurance company .
no bedside manner whatsoever .
both visits were good , i walked in and was helped within _num_ minutes .
my second visit was not so great .
the bow was square and sadly i was very disappointed .
and took _num_ hours !
the worst pedicure i have ever received .
this place sucks .
a couple of customers mentioned how cold it was .
i asked an employee if she could turn up the a/c .
not true , of course , because employees can move the thermostat .
wo n't make the mistake of going there again .
poor customer service !
not a good location .
wo n't be back .
no drive through .
we were the only one waiting on drinks and service was super slow .
then my replacement tasted watered down .
not impressed with this location .
worst starbucks on the entire planet !
and chelsea , her attitude is just as bad .
one star because zero is n't an option .
there is a guy that works there who is totally condescending .
this is not the first time he has been rude .
but this guy is nice to other people but not to me .
this is seriously the worst starbucks location in town !
the employees have such a bad and condescending attitude .
this is not the customer service i am used to at starbucks .
too bad .
sometimes i barely get a hello which is strange for starbucks .
but one of my order suppose to have no whip cream on .
no one went above and beyond to make me and my fianc feel welcomed .
just left this starbucks .
my drink had _num_ caramel in it what so ever & it tasted burnt .
worst starbucks in las vegas .
i guess she does n't even know what customer service is .
every time i go it 's a huge disappointment .
( she literally threw the door open and ordered us to leave . )
of course , that was our last session .
checked in and the computer said it would be a 10-15 minute wait .
so frustrating .
the clinic in this location is a joke .
this place was a complete joke .
_num_ $ for a few passport picture !
do n't take pictures at walgreen !
bad customer service and that 's all i have .
two different pills and something was still missing but guess what ?
there 's nothing like being sick and forced to deal with careless morons .
shame on our health care system for hiring morons to help us get better .
i now realize that if you get really sick you 'll be in trouble .
it should n't be difficult to get medication ever .
it is n't up for discussion .
never in my life , yelp .
stop being too busy to take care of people .
worst pharmacy i have ever come in contact with .
zero compassion or empathy for their patients .
she informed me that the problem was all my fault .
stay away and give your business to someone reputable who deserves it .
excuse me ?
yoga clothing , books , cds , candles and jewelry .
all of these items are highly over priced .
yoga is not about wanting and having .
i am very disappointed .
there was none of this .
for whatever reason guests are greeted with a very snotty and condescending tone .
but it ended up causing me more pain .
i have back problems , so this really hurt .
great place and great yoga classes , just bad business practices .
refund is apparently not an option .
but , they did n't do it .
i went here with my wife just to try out a new place .
she was rude and i would never recommend this place to a friend .
i 'm frustrated .
ca n't say i did n't try though !
two $ _num_ nachos .
i was in a rush so did n't found out till i got home .
tried calling and no one answered at all .
even the nachos were a mess and very messy put together .
my father is dying of cancer .
i 've brought him through the the drive-thru before without a problem .
guess what , i 'm a repeat customer with obvious needs .
words can not explain how upset i am .
not to mention , the other food i ate , upset my stomach .
maybe the employees should n't use the main entrance as their smoking area .
poor produce selections .
this location has been my vet for _num_ years .
i sadly have a mixed review .
i walked out pretty upset because i love my christmas .
he then threw up once more in my car on the way home .
it 's not pretty .
end his suffering at _num_ weeks old .
_num_ ) do nothing .
vca is a veterinary partner to the animal foundation .
and to be clear , the animal foundation is a kill shelter .
she failed to tell me that she herself was a supervisor .
that of course was not an option .
i have lost all trust in this place that initially showed compassion .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
glad i did n't go with this company .
left emails and several voice messages and never heard back .
this is the worst b & n i have ever been to .
the staff was horrible .
they were rude and very unhelpful .
this place was disgusting !
it was sunday , so i asked about their buy one get one promotion .
i am missing just reading on paper .
im really disappointed .
no offer of a discount or anything to make up for the issue .
i said no thanks and went home and ordered the book off amazon .
additionally , i agree with other yelpers that the staff here can be rude .
but my experience with rude staff was during the store 's busier days .
gas prices easily _num_ % higher than anywhere else .
so not much more to report .
but that 's not why there are _num_ stars .
_num_ star for having an ok selection of cheeses - but could be better .
_num_ stars for poor poor poor service .
a small cart will be over $ _num_ !
i am so tired of this market .
very expensive take out items , too .
$ _num_ for a take out , marginal burrito ?
the thing that drives me crazy are the long long lines at checkout .
does n't seem management is doing enough to control that !
is it just me or are all the people who cashier there extremely rude ?
he replied , `` no . ''
you could n't just admit you made a mistake ?
but i still get some of the same attitude there too .
wish we had an earth fare grocery store here in las vegas instead !
so it confused me .
classy , miss hippie .
no customer service .
gross .
thankfully it was slow , so it was right where i left it .
no assistance towards close to closing hour shopping .
no signs or descriptions of that .
sale tab said _num_ bucks for brown rice bread .
if sprouts was n't so far away i 'd go there .
bad move , i hear that a lot of customers are complaining about this .
my god , the girls there were so rude .
i could n't stick around another _num_ minutes to find out .
it was by all the ready prepared food that we eat .
she was so incredibly rude to our family !
whole foods is the worst market i have ever been to .
everything is overpriced and absolute garbage .
i have been there about _num_ times and not once have i enjoyed it .
they still have not put a register at the juice bar .
this is ridiculous .
i do n't understand how the summerlin whole foods ca n't get it together .
grilled chicken was super hard and dry too .
so disappointed .
too bad the town square location is too far .
i waited _num_ mins and then left .
no one greeted me again !
she never told me her name and she never asked for mine .
never got my id for an apartment showing either .
i was really blown away .
the apartments were ugly as well .
totally waste of time .
she was so rude and not even interested to lease an apartment .
this is the worst bk in the valley .
i went to this location _num_ times before giving up and driving farther .
as far as the dining room , i felt it was pretty clean .
the reason i gave them _num_ stars , is because the service was horrible !
we waited _num_ minutes before ordering .
the fries were cold and the other sandwich was not included .
he refused to refund my money or replace the missing sandwich .
i mean , how stupid can you be ?
seriously , i hate this part of town for this reason .
apparently it was the cook 's fault .
but please , please do n't insult me by serving what they call pizza .
and it 's expensive as hell .
it honestly looked like a frozen pizza .
and ill make this short and to the point .
the place has an arcade area on both sides and was relatively clean .
we here for their lunch buffet , very disappointing .
i was hoping that the food would be its saving grace but no .
dry , to greasy , and just horrible .
too many better choices to ever go here .
surprisingly , i 've never been to this place .
no call .
very disappointed .
i normally wo n't review a restaurant until i 've been there several times .
it 's very poor that they take it out on their guests .
the fried chicken was dry and soggy .
it 's not that difficult .
hopefully the pizza is less cardboard like .
they said they 'd check it out , and then did n't .
the guy working the register taking orders were completely rude !
the sale price was $ _num_ .
so i asked how late she would be there .
i am not really sure that was the correct chair .
then i said $ _num_ is the price .
horrible customer service .
pretty bad customer service .
this place sucked .
all the lamps they sold me were crap , made in china .
came in styrofoam from hell .
still here _num_ months later .
terrible service !
what a waste of time !
i tried to get advantage of the _num_ for _num_ sale on a tuesday .
took them home and never felt good about the way they looked .
a week passed and i tried them on again .
so i went back next day .
the attitude of the guy really pissed me off .
there are so many other stores with better customer service .
the annoying guy is the assistant manager or manager .
lazy cat .
guess this is not my place .
scheduled an appointment for 10:30 for a fitting for a rental tux .
where has the concept of customer service gone ?
do not use this company when renting for special occasions .
you could n't recommend taking it to a different location ?
we were not treated well the entire time .
they did n't offer a refund , or assist in any way .
it 's terrible .
it 's not worth it .
go anywhere else , go somewhere where `` renting '' is their business .
i just hope our review will help others .
the jackets had buttons fall off .
absolute worst customer service .
i walked out and bought a suit at another store .
the store does not stand behind their products .
big mistake .
there were even more mistakes to sizes and proportions .
wednesday comes along and we are ready to pick up our suits .
low and behold , the small was such a better fit .
i would definitely not recommend this place .
but i would gladly pay the difference for a better customer experience .
it was ok .
if so , avoid la quinta altogether .
i was quoted _num_ over the phone .
however this was not friendly at all !
hardly even talked !
this is horrible service and i will never go back .
i should not have paid them !
worst experience i have ever had !
very disappointed in the quality and service .
i walked in for a cut and color .
i went back the next day to see if they could fix it .
i would n't go back here .
if a client wants a blonde haircut give them a blonde haircut .
alfredo , our waiter barely acknowledged our request but we knew he heard us .
still no bread .
if you want decent food with bad service , then check it out .
there were only two other tables of two going .
after seating us , our waiter introduced himself as alfredo .
ugh , i will not be returning .
crappy lunch .
went there for lunch ... hardly anyone in the place .
placed our order but it took almost _num_ minutes .
anyway i tasted a piece of the meatball and it was flavorless and mushy .
i could n't eat any of it .
disappointed as i was so hungry .
i should 've went to subway for a $ _num_ meatball sandwich .
the owner here is clearly incompetent .
i would soon learn regret eating here again .
the marinara sauce was gross too .
the tomatoes tasted off beat and kind of old .
the ravioli was cold in the middle leaving the cheese to be gross inside .
the cesar salad was disgusting .
they over dressed the salad and the dressing itself was bitter and bad .
the lettuce also tasted dirty .
we blew $ _num_ on feeling sick and getting grossed out .
there was a time i used to crave their chicken alfredo .
this is another restaraunt impossible waiting to happen .
however , over the last few months , they got rid of it .
holy hell this place was terrible .
the food was just gross , limp fish and the service was bad .
what made the whole thing worse was i was starving .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
but the menu does n't have a good selection .
the service was terrible .
we 've tasted way better sushi and had way better service .
was not impressed with this restaurant ... .
guess i should have just ordered sushi !
prices are on the high side , our bill was about $ _num_ !
super sized offerings ( and prices ) does not a good restaurant make !
if you closed your eyes ... the bacon tasted like nothing !
it looked as appetizing as heck , though .
very disappointed with the claim jumper .
i would never go to this location again .
every time i have went here , the food has been hot garbage .
i still can not figure out why people like this place ?
but to me , it does not taste fresh at all .
gross .
nothing famous about this .
my husband ordered the pork tenderloin , with mashed potatoes and stuffing .
disgusting .
it was good but did not blow me away , kinda disappointing .
salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad .
tonight seated right away and the restaurant remained half full .
oh !
horrible does n't even begin to describe it !
_num_ ) the food i ordered came out dry and lukewarm .
it 's depressing , actually .
we went here for a corporate holiday lunch and i was very disappointed .
my main concern is the woman that organized our tables was so rude .
she alone , is the reason i will not be going back , ever .
just not the same fresh ingredients anymore .
not going back , to many good places to eat at with my money .
the service was definitely lacking here .
they could not believe the waitress was still there .
my husband seems to think it declined since they were bought out .
maybe , they 've declined as well ?
like the _num_ star rating says ... i 've had better .
the service was slow , and our waiter forgot to bring our appetizer .
overall the ambiance is loud and crowded .
it 's been going further and further downhill for a few years now .
one at the town square is way better service .
this was my favorite restaurant for ten years .
every time we go back , it seems to be worse and worse .
hubby ordered chicken n ribs , hi chicken was bleeding , undercooked !
he removed the _num_ entrees from our bill .
the service was n't bad , the food was !
this place is just lame !
it 's lucky i gave it _num_ stars .
the food was nothing over average .
also it would have tasted sooo much better !
i 've never been a fan of this place and i 'm still now .
i took _num_ bite and did n't like it at all .
lunch was completely dead in here and it did n't surprise me .
tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am i disappointed .
the _num_ of us went here on a friday afternoon mid august .
it 's not like the claim jumper of prior that i remember .
usually this place is busy .
so we get our drinks and we proceed to order .
the jalapenos for me anyway were a bit much .
my garden salad was just ok .
my husband 's sliders were just barely ok .
the pasta dish was a big portion also but a bit bland .
and my tomato basil pizza was just barely okay .
we had to flag down another person just to grab a side of sauce .
our bill came to $ _num_ and change .
i will not be going back .
i also ordered soup which came after i questioned where my soup was .
however , service is nice but slow .
horrible !
racist ?
anyway , end of story is we 're never coming back !
terrible meals .
from the dinner salad to the roasted chicken the food was not good .
very disappointing .
this used to be one of my favorite places to eat .
so here are two young ladies standing at our table with salads .
so annoying .
it 's hard for us to get through all the chairs .
do n't waste your time or money on this place !
no more muffins ?
no more cheese bread ?
cold chicken wings ?
soggy salad ?
truly a shame .
this place was absolutely horrible .
we waited _num_ minutes before receiving any drinks .
not a sorry or well take care of it .
to top it off we barely got a discount !
david was great but the management was unbelievably bad .
then before you knew it , no more muffins with your entree .
food quality was terrible , portion size for price was terrible .
sour pasta and tiny $ _num_ salad !
left this place hungry and $ _num_ in the toilet !
my daughter even said my pasta was better than their attempt at cooking !
i frequent this restaurant because the location is convenient for me .
my last visit , however , i was disappointed .
the service was very disappointing but the food as always is delish .
total disappointment this time around !
he was not friendly , never asked how our food was .
then we sat for another ten waiting for him to bring it back .
this place just is n't what it used to be .
the `` complimentary '' bread they gave us was awful .
stale and flavorless .
pretzel sticks appetizer , the sticks were burned on the bottom .
cashew chicken sandwich bread was soggy .
on another occasion , there was plastic wrapping in the burger .
the bloody mary i ordered was just mediocre .
bathrooms were both dirty and poorly stocked !
i 'm done w/ this place !
she looks it up ... and there is no record of a reservation .
bland and overpriced .
the one redeeming thing was the salads we stared the meal with .
salad was old ( lettuce ) .
the service was horrible .
we never received ketchup , ranch , cocktail sauce or refills on our drinks .
the manager gave us _num_ % off the check .
we will never dine at this place again .
the service was slow .
i ordered a stuffed baked potato .
obviously we wo n't be going back .
i lost my appetite .
i was frustrated and just wanted to leave .
i am never coming back here again .
it was not crowded and we chose to sit in a booth .
very dry hello .
i asked for my chicken to be warm and she said no problem .
ick .
i did n't eat any of it .
well honestly , i could n't because it was horrible .
after about _num_ minutes , the waitress finally came back around .
i said well ok and she immediately walked off .
finally on sunday , justin called me .
said that he would get the information over to the summerlin location .
i was clearly upset and she did not do a thing .
visited last night ( perhaps for the last time ) .
vegetables are n't included either .
i 've been to this location in the past , and it was ok .
however , this time was much worse .
not to mention , the menu needed to be cleaned .
was n't a fan of the limited beer selection .
luckily , they did not charge me for the salad , just the beer .
very disappointing .
not the waiters fault .
fish tacos were cold and wedge salad came after the tacos .
will not be back ... dirty dining .
this last time i went for a late lunch .
i ordered the soup and salad off the lunch menu .
they told me it was the same size as just ordering the salad alone .
i wound up paying more for my salad than the soup and salad .
either way i will never go back .
wo n't be back .
this last time there was no excuse .
wo n't be back for quite some time , if ever !
four cold dinners is far too many .
i did n't even want to give them a one star .
my family and i were in las vegas for thanksgiving ( _num_ ) .
_num_ people had clam chowder instead of salad , it was cold and thick .
nothing about the dinner was hot .
the service was slow , but that was to be expected .
when asked , the waiter said that there was no ham when we ordered .
we 're sorry you 're disappointed .
we ordered some burgers , appetizers , and the jambalaya pasta .
when they walked out of the restaurant i asked for the manager again .
needless to say that we will not be going back .
i hate writing the really bad ones .
first off , this is a chain .
our bad .
after _num_ minutes he apologized for the order not coming out .
after _num_ minutes he apologized again .
my wife had the absolute tortellini .
it was ok , nothing special .
stone cold .
this was fried fish , stone cold .
i should know better than to eat at a chain .
however the calzone that the other daughter ordered came out with raw dough .
he then went off to get us the bill .
when he comes back he states he would take off half the bill .
so two hours later and my one daughter leaves hungry .
they completely ruined our family meal .
just bad .
they were almost burned and dry .
like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all night .
daughter had $ _num_ salmon .
other daughter had parmesan crusted chicken with pasta - very bland .
top sirloin was so average for $ _num_ .
i could have cooked it better at home on a bad day .
this place is pathetic .
all i can say is the food was bland !
there used to be a spice to it but now it tastes like nothing .
poor service .
this is seriously the worst .
if i could give negative stars , i would .
told the waiter we were leaving and would not be paying .
terrible .
cold tasteless food .
pasta had no flavor whatsoever .
baked potato was burned and ribs were cold in center .
wo n't be coming back ever .
just called to make a reservation .
just called to make a reservation .
i will never return to this restaurant !
she said it tasted like it was frozen .
my wife selected _num_ items that we knew were on the happy hour menu .
by now , we 're frustrated and just pay the bill .
this is by far the worst company you can ever work for .
they literally treat them worst than trash .
rude receptionist .
overall overpriced , not worth it , and crappy .
i myself did n't even buy anything at sams club that day .
seems like it should be a pretty fast or at least a welcoming experience .
not sure why that was any trouble ?
it was a rough day for all of us , apparently .
this location sucks .
rude and unfriendly employees on multiple occasions .
really limit what i buy because costco has items that is much better .
biggest issue is the store needs a major update .
this place does n't even deserve one star .
went today to find a turkey and peanut oil , well they sold out .
who the hell is the buyer for this location ?
your out of turkey s _num_ days before thanksgiving ?
boy are you dumb .
i am going to check out costco .
however , for some reason i waited almost _num_ minutes to be helped .
one girl was working so slow it was like she was half asleep .
the other two older women were simply rude .
worst customer services .
lesson learned , never buy from sams club .
sams club u failed !
he said that service stopped in _num_ .
she told me i would have to get the number to call from them .
i called corporate again , and spoke with someone that was worse than tim .
he then apologized and got off the phone .
i went to another sams club to get the work done .
sam 's club sucks .
he gets _num_ stars no one else there does .
the worst service and experience anywhere .
if i could give _num_ starts i would .
oh none !
sams club is sams club and do n't expect the speedy checkout like costco .
this place is rude and slow as hell .
will not be back to this sam 's club .
what the hell .
plus that cashier was slow as hell .
terrible old pizza been sitting in the window for hours and hours and hours .
terrible service , food , and atmosphere .
no words .
wish i could give a negative star !
employees rude !
going to try another location if not better costco next year .
do n't let them fool you .
new management is horrible .
lots of unnecessary renovation going on .
mail boxes recently broken into .
i never write reviews but this place is terrible .
went over to have my move out inspection done .
guess what , no inspection .
no letter .
no phone call .
run away from this awful company !
the management here is so so horrible .
god , they are so rude , they are not helpful .
it took _num_ weeks for my dryer to get fixed .
nothing has changed .
comment below is the same line of crap you post to every online complaint .
why not try fixing the problem .
oh wait , you probably wo n't fire yourself ... .
your money is better spent elsewhere .
management could care less about residents .
would not recommend to anyone .
staff lacks knowledge and professionalism .
neighbors & their pets are loud .
maintenance is lacking & the gates are always broken .
substandard apartments are not worth the price you pay for them .
not just the grass .
combination of lazy dog owners and lazy management .
and you wo n't have dog poop everywhere .
- worst management ever .
- maintenance requests ignored .
still have a request from over a year ago that has n't been completed .
do not let this place fool you !
it 's starts off like a dream apartment .
i been having a leaking ac unit for almost a month now .
horrible place !
there 's no security .
except a car that drives through maybe once a night .
place is shady and management does n't care about anyone but getting money .
this play deserves no stars .
my advice is stay far away .
the lakes is a lousy neighborhood anyway .
one week to fix the ac ( mid july !
i emailed and physically visited their office at least _num_ times .
they promised calls and emails back , and i never got any .
instead , they sent me to a collections agency .
this is hands down the worst management ever .
ive only been here _num_ months and am already fed up .
for example , i recently filed a maintenance request for a broken toilet .
of course , she did n't follow through and the damage got worse .
do n't fall for the curb appeal , this place has become substandard .
it took _num_ days to get someone to even come look at it .
when they did the plug blew and smoked my apartment .
after over a week they finally got it fixed and management did nothing .
the girl was nasty and said i do n't know let me look .
i called monday and they said nothing was here .
the people in that office are horrible and rude .
would n't recommend until management works on friendliness and communication with residents .

are you kidding me ?
the day i was suppose to move in my unit was not ready .
i walked into a unit and had the worst odor .
she broke my lease for me and put me on month to month .
however after a week nothing had been done .
all kinds of promises made , none kept .
this place looked promising online .
_num_ hard hits to my credit ?
are you kidding me ?
i 've lived here for _num_ months and this has happened _num_ times .
further , every time i call the office , no one returns my call .
they are raising the rent by $ _num_ as well .
i have sent an email to the manager as requested on here .
unfortunately , this was by far the worst place i 've lived that .
the apartment was okay , but the staff was amazingly horrible .
turn around for the staff was very frequent .
people would quit all the time .
getting maintenance can be very tough .
she just did n't care and said too bad .
so then i walked out and needed to speak with her again .
this has been the worst staff i have ever been around .
my boyfriend and i left az at about 4pm on thursday night .
i do n't bother leaving messages anymore .
we drove through the night to get me back to my apartment .
now they do n't even have _num_ .
it 's safe to say , something 's seriously wrong here .
most worse place in whole las vegas .
and i bet you 're management is incompetent enough to post another lame response .
so i guess we will be talking to our lawyer .
unfortunately since then there has been nothing but problems .
i finally got out of this hell hole and bought a house .
in fact , it does n't deserve even half a star .
over the weekend i was packing to move and went to shower .
the next morning i woke up to no water , without notice again .
a notice would be nice at the very least , do n't u think ?
bugs are a major problem during the summer .
speaking to someone at the front office is nearly impossible via phone call .
i applied for and paid a _num_ fee to rent an apartment here .
for some unknown reason and i was not told why i was denied .
no response only a welcome email .
first off my husband never got a response and i never got response either !
they could n't get our order right .
slow service , they were out of practically all the bagels .
fail !
have to bump this location down a star .
i would n't recommend it .
i walk in , there 's nobody there to greet me .
bad service and no bacon ?
it 's not even worth the buy one get one !
recently , i 've switched to bagels .
this may deserve two stars , since i still go there .
why do n't they make more of something they always sell out of ?
they 've lost a number of sale opportunities just with my self alone .
i feel like they 're annoyed that i 'm there .
so i get my bagels ( if they have them ) and bolt out .
the order was wrong on the _num_ visits and the coffee is cold .
these people are clueless .
this location is now officially disgusting .
the bagels are ok , as is the coffee .
i went to einstein bagels on w. sahara this morning ... what a disaster .
the employees there used to be nice and service was efficient .
when i walked in this morning i saw all new faces .
so ... back to the cashier to get a refund .
if you see her avoid her and her attitude .
why i came back here today i have no idea .
is not part of their language .
i wish they would close this location so it 's no longer an option .
i 've given this place too many chances and they 've disappointed every time .
do not go there unless you like be treated by very rude people .
worst service ever for a little bagel shop .
it was slimy and smelly .
she had a girl make another one with turkey this time .
the employees were very nice but that doesnt make up for the bad food .
very disappointing experience .
this place was disappointing !
got some bagels , they were so old you could n't cut them .
ca n't believe i gave it a second chance .
i threw my bagels out .
this place is disgusting .
this is one of the worst restaurants i have ever encountered .
they have never once apologized for messing up my order .
stopped by for a quick bite .
what really struck me was the current condition of the cleanliness of the restaurant .
disappointing experience .
it 's one of our favorite bagel shops .
however , i 'm greatly disappointed today .
i kid you not , it smelled like piss in there .
i could n't stand it .
the cashier would n't even look up at me .
these people are rude unprofessional and have no customer service skills whatsoever .
our visit at einstein 's started out just fine .
mine was not cooked , it was lukewarm and the cheese was not melted .
my husband did not receive butter on his bagel .
she loudly said , `` no !
sadly , i was wrong .
it 's hard to imagine that my order rarely comes out right .
so this past weekend i stopped by in the morning and ordered my usual .
management needs to wake up and hire some competent people .
sandwiches are pretty skimpy on ingredients and came out dry .
- $ _num_ , want a strawberry jam ?
i came to this location and ordered a bagel toasted with plain cream cheese .
the bagel did n't look like it had been toasted .
there was no color to it and it was still very soft .
i took a bite and it was n't even warm .
still not toasted enough .
wo n't go back to this location .
that guy was so rude .
horrible service .
do n't bother with this location !
will not come back .
i 'm not looking for out of this world service either .
but my god !
geez , maybe you could have prepared for a busy morning ?
this is where all hell broke loose !
she could n't figure out how to change the register and kept laughing .
i do n't get it .
this issue alone would n't have caused this review .
if i did n't have a life i would make an official complaint .
i will never go back there .
side note , i could n't give zero stars or i would have .
do not understand what their system is .
i ordered _num_ bagels and it took _num_ minutes to complete the order .
all the people waiting were talking to each other about the ridiculous system .
it does n't make any sense .
the bagels are great but the service is very inconsistent and often very slow .
go to one of the other locations , you will not be disappointed .
always over staffed and staff is always slow .
terrible i will go to the one on rainbow .
really bad service .
frustrating on a sunday morning .
this is nuts all i did was take a shower in the tubs .
do not be fooled .
but their management is not very good .
bad news : they did n't fix the carpet the ripped up .
that was annoying .
seriously disappointing .
i walk in and workers will see me but ignore me .
this may be the reason i get ignored .
extremely bad experience with the desert rock store consignment .
so disappointed in this store .
these apartments have not been updated in _num_ years .
one star is too much for this complex .
the microwave is so old and stained in a yellow and orange color .
yeah , sorry , that unit was already rented .
enough of this nonsense and incompetence .
if i could give negative stars i would .
then we had numerous other major problems .
no one is coming to fix anything .
cant wait for my lease to be up .
they 're constantly changing staff in the front office because they 're so incompetent .
i paid $ _num_ to break my lease .
i 'm told to wait _num_ months to get my deposit back .
every day they hold my money is a day too long .
in the _num_ months i lived here , the staff changed completely twice .
the only good thing is the location and the maintenance guys .
as to the idea of eating anything other than the pizza , forget it .
disgusting .
eating it , however , is out of the question .
stopped by here for a quick dinner on a late sunday night .
it is supposedly the hottest pepper on the planet ?
its pretty expensive too , $ _num_ for _num_ tenders or _num_ wings .
not impressed .
the service was painfully slow and they were n't even busy .
: priceless !
@ chips + salsa / beer cheese - the salsa was just okay .
the beer cheese just really did n't work .
you might as well pour oil into some beer and dip it in that .
i asked for medium rare , one of the _num_ sliders was overcooked .
the taste department was so dry , flavorless , and uninspired .
the onions and mushrooms did nothing for this dish .
i had to add barbecue sauce to a filet to make it not suck !
not even warmed up or anything special done to it .
@ olive deep dish pizza - this just was n't that good .
deep dish is suppose to be packed full of flavors .
this was like eating bread dipped in ketchup and olives , flavorless and boring .
our group did try it and it was n't that bad for many .
but with a little milk and time , everyone was okay .
not like the oh em gee i ca n't open my mouth or eyes .
i would n't come here for the food again .
a great staff can only make bad food go so far .
that 's annoying !
it 's just a weird and annoying feature of eating out .
also the sliders here are only decent .
( big dogs comes close , but not quite . )
what can chicago brewing company do to save itself ?
however , i wo n't hold my breath .
upstairs there are three small seating areas , but only small group was there .
the food ?
the chips were n't that good either .
i was so disappointed .
i do n't know that i would come back here .
we were unhappy .
it took nearly another _num_ minutes .
big big mistake , my husband ordered hot wings .
he said they were some of the worst he had ever had .
he said they were n't hot enough and were terribly dry .
my fries were cold , my chili was cold and the flavor was off .
such a let down .
i think they accidentally put it as hot instead of mild .
what a terrible mistake .
it was too spicy , i could n't even eat more than two bites .
i ended up throwing it away .
there goes $ _num_ .
there goes $ _num_ down the drain .
the service was n't good but it was n't bad .
the food was n't that great .
the sliders were lacking flavor .
the thin pizza was made with some funky dough .
the kind of dough that you get from pizza hut .
the service was spotty .
our server would disappear at times .
must be a beer thing , cuz the food sucked .
signed up for yelp to leave this review .
service is atrocious and i will never be back .
i will also advice everyone e i know to stay away .
tuna salad was nasty tuna was spoiled but they made good on it .
terrible !
i so wanted this place to be great ... unfortunately , it was disgusting !
he responded this is n't a chicago bar !
just a price of advice have chicago friendly bartenders at least support the name .
service was average , but nothing worth coming back for .
i used to go here but never again ... this place has horrible service .
no one even stopped us as we walked out !
zero stars !
crappy service !
i 'm sure they wo n't even care about this review .
this wo n't take long .
it seriously was just meh .
nothing to get excited over .
nothing bad .
absolutely terrible food .
clearly not remotely fresh .
french fries were stale as hell and cold .
we have been eating dinner here every friday for the last _num_ years .
jesse is a hot head that should not be in customer service !
in a word disappointing .
, has been rather rude and giving poor service as of late .
i was craving some great cracker thin , crispy style pizza .
aside from it being unbelievably salty , the flavor was just bland .
waitresses were more worried about the bartenders .
we have two kids , so have to sit in the restaurant .
i know they do not care , but we will never go there again .
if i could give zero stars i would !
do n't give them any of your money !
never going here again , and definitely not recommending anyone here !
its been _num_ days now and i am still not recovered .
worst _num_ days of my life .
needless to say i will never come here again .
my husband and children 's meals were bland , forgettable , and overpriced .
how i wish i had anything that good to report about my steak sandwich .
this was the worst steak sandwich i 've ever had .
i had no idea they could even be bad until i had that one .
my husband and i could not .
i will never go back there , and i told the staff why .
never ever will i go to chicago brewing company after my experience tonight .
you have just lost a lot of business .
cheers to even more business lost for you guys tonight .
it was so nasty !
baked ziti , gone !
meatball sliders , gone !
chicago hotdog , gone !
pot roast , gone !
i literally have no reason to ever return to this place again .
way to piss off & lose all your loyal customers chicago brewing co. !
this place just does n't care about it 's customers .
so , our first time to chicago brewery .
and of course , the calamari was like chewing on a rubber band .
new menu recently went into effect .
no more fried filet mignon entree or sliders .
no more ranch chips ... .
and the list goes on .
the biggest disappointment was the under cooked under seasoned hot wings .
the skin was slimy not crisp and the hot sauce flavor was nonexistent .
so sad to see another good restaurant go downhill .
wo n't be back .
long story short .
waiter saw that and gave me a dirty look .
it 's a bar , 2am , get over yourselves .
speaking of them , the crowd was young , too much for me .
service is what kills it .
service was sooooooo slow .
no reason to come back especially with better in the same shopping center .
oh chicago , it pains to me to write this bad review .
our burgers was ok , but the most disappointing item was the chocolate cake .
i am getting my cake from cheesecake factory next time !
found this location to be poorly staffed out front .
their staffs are quite rude .
horrible service and follow up .
would never recommend .
there was no problem with me staying with them for their exams .
i was not comfortable with this and made it known to the assistant .
no one ever came out to get me .
no even when my six year old started to act up .
still no assistant came out to inform me of anything .
at this time i went ahead and cancelled all future appointments .
the visits seem to get worse and worse .
do n't waste your time or money .
piss poor ... .
not nyc style pizza .
more like the pizza i had to suffer with in buffalo , ny .
garlic knots with hardly any garlic .
cannoli not good either .
do n't go there looking for ny style pizza !
i had a horrible experience using my groupon there today !
my groupon expired feb 9th which is today .
i have contacted groupon , and they gave me credit for this anyway .
so you get $ _num_ off ? ''
talk about obnoxious !
at checkout , he wanted to charge me $ _num_ something .
i told him that total does n't seem right .
unfortunately , the chicken marsala was subpar .
the marsala sauce was very subtle and it was more like a buttered pasta .
first impression was just another dive .
unfortunately , yesterday , not so good .
i had ordered linguini with clam sauce and better half had spaghetti and meatballs .
my husbands spaghetti and meatballs arrived again without utensils .
sorry , but this place is only average .
decent ingredients but not made with love , just thrown together .
waited _num_ minutes , no dessert .
went to the clerk to check status on our dessert .
crappy customer service !
i suggest ordering for take out or delivery .
same price as actual pizza from long island areas .
but still not as good as actual ny pizza .
but the customer service was so bad i may not go again .
terrible service my food was terrible .
they would not refund me unless i brought it back .
what a waste if my hard earned money .
dont waste your time with this place , i wont again .
so very disappointed with this place and probably wo n't buy from them again .
the pizza was really mediocre .
for a place to claim ny style , it definitely fell under par .
the sauce was horrible , with a nasty after taste .
the cheese was nothing close to special .
the crust was flavorless .
was n't what i had expected and i wo n't be returning .
then she asked for payment , even though we paid over the phone .
of course when we opened our food , it was cold .
then she hung up on my boyfriend .
i waited _num_ minutes for the two orders my wife and i ordered .
the wings were dry and over cooked .
but it was highly disrespectful and low of him .
no lettuce , no tomatoes , no taste .
even the bread does n't taste like it used to .
i wo n't be back .
our order to go included fettuccine alfredo with shrimp .
got home and found out the shrimp was not cooked , at all .
i wo n't be going back .
i ate as soon as i got home .
entree was soggy and the desert was covered in mold .
so , i 'm posting them all over the internet .
i literally cried leaving this place .
not a thing on my plate was edible .
i just know that they were terrible .
i could n't eat more than _num_ bites before i had had enough .
i ca n't believe i spent $ _num_ on a plate of vegetable mush .
it 's pretty insulting , if you ask me .
the taste of the food was unusual , but not unpleasant .
it did n't taste like shit .
but this is not high praise .
you do n't get a lot of food for the price you pay .
our meal came to $ _num_ , and we had no leftovers .
when i think of raw food , i think salads .
this place however , was unlike anything i have ever seen .
way too expensive .
unfortunately i can not pin point what the smell was .
i then ordered the salads , which yes , they were huge .
let me just break it down why i am only giving _num_ stars .
went into raw food cafe today to get a juice and i was denied .
the door was open , people were in there , i saw the veggies .
i probably will not go back .
this place was sooo disappointing !
i am highly confused on the rave reviews .
but it sucked !
she looked at us very strangely and walked away .
the food was eh ' .
so i just assumed we pay up front .
gross !
so i had to wait until i finished the meal .
and there 's no mentioning of cold soup in the menu .
i really did n't like it !
the toppings tasted very similar to a _num_ layer dip which was n't bad .
the neat loaf was in my opinion , disgusting .
kind of looked like it too to be honest .
she then says , `` then give it to your parents . ''
no . ''
was so excited about trying this restaurant .
literally one of the worst meals i 've ever had !
so disappointed .
when i say `` god awful '' i 'm not exaggerating .
`` thanks for the spoon but it still tastes like crap ! ''
i always get a weird feeling inside and ca n't wait to get out .
they also moved the cash register around the corner which is awkward .
they have it laid out horribly .
portion sizes were way too small and the price was way too much .
the biggest disappointment was the service .
the trash outside next to the lakeside tables is always overflowing .
a shame cause it would be a nice place to sit .
so disappointed .
and did n't even take it off the bill .
what a mistake .
no big deal .
i cried a little driving out of their parking lot .
what a horrible experience .
the lighting was terrible !
i do not recommend climbing here .
i do n't even feel like reviewing this place .
_num_ . )
it smells like socks and dirty shoes .
_num_ . )
the place was ok but the guy working there was awful .
for the most part you are left to do your thing .
there are _num_ floors .
not as easy as it looks or maybe its just not my thing .
needless to say i did get down in one piece obviously .
bad gym for a date .
waste of time with _num_ different employees .
not very big .
would give _num_ star , but _num_ stars because its good for kids .
i 've even been to this place before , and passed their test .
very poor customer service .
the young man at the front desk clearly does n't love his job !
worst experience ever .
the person at the front desk was rude and disrespectful .
he tried to kick is out without our money back .
i came here to get _num_ pages printed .
he ended up printing my papers one by one , all _num_ of them .
that 's where that extra _num_ minutes came from .
screw you office max on charleston and your `` weird system ! ''
the customer service here is the worst .
i wo n't be going to that location .
the first one came with no problem .
this happened _num_ times before we got anything .
now here we go lol .
but i do n't spend money where i am not respected .
very unhappy with our experience .
then the chair arrived _num_ days later than they said it would .
i was n't overly happy with my experience .
went to pickup the desk , found the area for online pickup and waited .
no one acknowledged me until i was on my out the door .
contacted customer service and got the email equivalent of a form letter .
should have stayed with amazon !
groupon apologized and immediately refunded me for the laser hair removal package .
i like wendy 's food , prices , etc .
but after this ( my 3rd time ) i ca n't do it anymore .
wow , was i so wrong !
i needed a gallon of water just to get through the night .
taco bell an wendy 's .
huge disappointment .
absolutely horrible customer service .
the female manager with red hair is rude and lazy .
fucking joke of a establishment ... you guys give wendy 's a bad name !
no condiments really ?
took _num_ minutes to get my order .
unbelievable ... and these are the people wanting $ _num_ an hour ?
she is most disrespectful , unhelpful and rude manager i have encountered .
go on google and read their other terrible reviews .
stay away !
unbelievable ... .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
why would he want to live where management is ridiculous !
there was only _num_ other table there eating other then us .
my meal was $ _num_ a little pricey for the quality that was served .
i 'd go back but i would definitely try something else .
not so much last sunday .
not our worry .
we did n't see a bartender at any time while we were there .
it was a bad experience .
ordered wings - they were way way overdone and dry .
but getting rid of an excellent kitchen staff does n't make sense .
very very not happy .
let me say that again , half off all alcohol .
these are n't what you 're thinking .
the marinara sauce was super overpowering to some really mediocre mac n cheese .
such a shame .
very very very overcooked .
barely any breading on it .
the food was incredibly disappointing and took a long time as well .
ordered the street tacos - could barely see the tortillas .
not worth it .
- really a shame ... .
i have no problem with that .
so far nothing they did was of quality work .
had to bring back repair , steering went out with family in car .
i gave a _num_ because i ca n't give a zero .
however , i had not been there for a few years .
he said i owed them $ _num_ for the tow and diagnostic .
i paid the $ _num_ and drove the car home .
a savings of over $ _num_ .
the fact is the car blue book value is about $ _num_ .
tried to over charge us for dental work that is not necessary !
if i could give this dentist and staff a negative star i would .
your office manager was rude and did not tell you the truth .
sorry you were fooled by your staff .
she has no professionalism .
she also screaming at me `` i am not an idiot '' several times .
i am so surprised that getting a file from your office is so difficult .
yes we went to another dentist .
front desk was friendly and welcoming , but i do n't trust this place .
at least _num_ people have been robbed so far .
and management did nothing to help .
carpet is substandard .
lose the tie douche ... .
you do n't smell like money .
management did n't care .
the reason for _num_ star ?
the leasing consultant did not explain the lease terms correctly .
the late fee was $ _num_ ... .
it 's _num_ for cable even if you do n't watch .
and have a common sense of courtesy to anyone below me .
i have the worst downstairs neighbors .
they just started allowing dogs so everyone ran out and got a pit bull .
not worth the aggravation .
first , the break ins .
my apartment was broken into in march of _num_ .
she attempted to put me in contact with the sites maintenance manager .
he called me _num_ minutes later saying he had called a tow truck .
i waited two more hours with no idea what was happening .
i was also over two hours late for my job by this time .
i was over _num_ hours late for work .
there are tons of break ins as the security here is basically non-existent .
shout out to the maintenance guys though , they are awesome !
i do not recommend .
because he did n't want to take a nap ?
i would suggest that people do n't waste their money here .
wednesday january _num_ .
why do businesses do this to people that are just trying to survive !
ive had my car done here before , it was a brake job .
i had some steering and alignment problems from collision damage .
these guys rip you off and overcharge for used parts .
no way was i gon na let them fix what they made worse .
worst customer service ever !
awful dry cleaners !
as soon as i walked in , i felt uncomfortable .
no clue why .
worst place ever !
they do n't honor yelp check ins .
just picked up my _num_ items .
two pairs of jeans to be hemmed and a sweater for dry cleaning .
do n't bother looking for a clean car here !
the sign says go inside for quarters to use self wash .
the attendant inside did n't want to drop quarters so no wash .
am i missing something ?
not here .
not impressed .
i tried going back but i did n't find anything .
one of the tops was cute but it had a hole in it .
after that disappointing exchange of words , i used the restroom .
well , i kept looking ... shoes , then purses .
i might as well have been talking to the wall .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a nice day '' .
oh , and by the way , i will not be back !
we were barely greeted when we walked in .
so we left without buying anything and with no information .
will not go back to this location .
do not get a reading from rose .
it 's like she hates people .
it was n't worth it .
thanks : april .
terrible .
omg if yelp had minus stars this store would get a million minus stars .
what can i say horrible in a million ways .
horrible as it get 's in my opinion .
just to much bad bad experience here .
i do n't plan to return here soon , maybe ever again .
last week i went in to find the manager sleeping on the job .
they hardly carry any of their original items anymore .
this place is n't as positive and wonderful as it used to be .
a friend took me here once for karaoke -- apparently it goes pretty late .
hello , this review is on the karaoke portion of the bar .
very slow .
they had me wait _num_ minutes just for a menu !
shame , shame .
this particular visit sucked , four hour wait to sing one song .
yes the place is packed on friday night 's but damn this was ridiculous .
there is also a one drink minimum and the drinks are not cheap .
never again , do n't waste your time !
i was amazed to find several reviews that i could have written myself .
service is friendly , but slow .
slow service and junk food are tolerable if not expected .
no setup required !
there 's no shame in making money .
they , however , let everyone know ahead of time .
do n't play favorites .
this is a business , not a private party for all of your friends .
skip the dance party .
i was totally confused .
it is n't super fancy by any means , but it is o.k .
after i seated myself i was quickly assisted .
there was nothing special about the salad .
but it was n't bad either .
one of the rows was almost cold enough to still be considered frozen .
they were beer battered .
the beer batter had no flavor to it at all .
it just gave the fries an extra crunch to them .
all-in-all not worth the extra calories .
the fries were just fries .
to wash everything down i had an iced tea .
i am very glad i did have something to wash everything down .
the service is unwelcoming and the place stinks !
the bathroom is disgusting , makes me think about that kitchen .
there are a lot of angry , drunk women who come through that door .
way to run an establishment , mr. gordon .
his response `` i 'm busy you have to wait '' .
she refused to adjust the bill .
the place really is n't any fun .
drinks are overpriced and the service is very slow .
if you 're looking for a great place to sing karaoke look elsewhere .
this was one of the worst experiences i have ever had .
the place was dirty , outdated , and just not fun .
if you are not a regular , you are basically worthless there .
this place is probably the worst karaoke bar i have ever been too .
the layout is a very large open room with dive bar decor .
it was _num_ degrees outside .
wrong !
i left feeling so disgusted and angry .
it 's a gaming establishment , do n't you comp drinks all day long ?
we sat there for about _num_ minutes then realized he was not coming back .
the bartenders there have always been terrible and shame on me for going back .
i 've been there twice , months ago , and very recently .
most recently , i went on a very slow weekend night .
my star rating may change after one more visit .
sucks you have to give _num_ star .
do n't waste your money .
it was dead when myself and _num_ friends walked in .
i lost $ _num_ on the machine and still have a $ _num_ tap .
not drinking alcohol at all !
do n't do n't do n't waste your money !
worse bar in vegas !
today i walked in .
no waitress .
i was sent back into the restaurant by the bartender working .
still no waitress .
when she finally came out she did not greet me .
she had a bad attitude .
when she took my order she seemed very rushed .
was not polite at all .
needless to say i was quite upset !
ridiculous !
as an instructor i can rent gear for students at any dive shop !
this place sucks .
the biggest discount they had was _num_ % !
prices still high even going out of business .
not sad to see this place go .
but i did n't , which is why i am writing this review .
needless to say , i am so disappointed .
probably the most terrible customer support i have ever encountered .
i am new to the area and do n't have a dentist .
incredibly bad service .
the rest of the food was just okay .
i wanted to like it , it just was n't anything exceptional .
not impressed .
do n't bother .
i 'm not in this to review other yelpers .
the food was just standard thai food , nothing spectacular .
the service is where it hits rock bottom .
i noticed the mistake and called them back .
and then etc , etc .
so yes lady , i do want my $ _num_ back .
horrible .
i checked yelp to see where we should venture out to .
i guess i was let down .
they handed us our menus without a word being spoken .
i 'm not asking for million dollar service here but some service at least ?
please do n't waste your money here .
i ordered shrimp pad thai and the mongolian beef .
not tender , some kind of cheap cut and greasy .
should 've checked out reviews before coming here .
lost my appetite immediately .
um ... why would i want to eat another ?
and then in the end they did n't even compensate me !
yeah , sure i 'll come back .
all of them were bland and very greasy .
the chicken in both dishes was overcooked , but the shrimp was cooked nicely .
i would n't recommend king & i .
said they spoke with the restaurant and the driver was on his way .
no biggie .
luckily they gave us a full refund .
the worst food i 've ever had .
the meat was boiled which gave off a foul odor !
i 'm hoping it was n't boiled horse meat !
it would n't let me post without !
very disappointing .
the dumplings were soggy and tasted funny .
this stopped happening and service got rude .
not sure what made the same staff have such a bad attitude change .
over all thumbs up .
so my group member reluctantly ate it .
it was extremely salty .
i tried my wife 's mint beef dish and that was also very salty .
bottom line : service : thumbs down .
food : thumbs down .
terrible .
would not recommend to anyone .
there was some weird after taste ; i could n't figure it out .
this is the first time i am writing a review on yelp .
sure , it 's a negative one !
this place has the worst customer service ever !
his english is somewhat limited i think .
but it didnt stop him from being extremely rude !
he even did n't care about that .
i am sure there should be a better thai delivery place in _num_ area !
wish i could give it no stars .
catered an order for _num_ of vegetarian dishes .
do n't waste your time with this place !
nothing like how it should be .
chicken tasted weird and the sauce was nothing like how it should be .
so minus _num_ stars for making me sick .
and this place has a b rating so that explains it !
does any of the cooks have any taste buds ?
the rest of the food tasted odd .
both tasted off , nothing what i was expecting .
would not recommend .
tables are sticky , food just sitting out in the open .
food is just bland .
avoid this place !
_num_ min .
between her and her client that i rent from nothing is ever accomplished .
she is very unprofessional and does not follow through on anything !
avoid .
a dentist should be more concerned about his patients than his pockets .
ill gladly take my dentistry needs elsewhere .
it has taken me this long just to be able to write this post .
avoid avoid avoid !
needless to say , they wo n't be getting a penny from me .
will definitely not get a port of subs sandwich again .
i totally understood and decided to wait the additional _num_ to order .
he has to wait like everyone else . ''
i immediately left and will never be back !
i went to this particular location and it was kind of dirty .
she claimed she owned _num_ other baskin robbins & had for _num_ yrs .
oh well , way to ruin a little boy 's cake !
i thought it was rude and bad customer service .
she reluctantly entered the coupon and gave me a correct price .
no problem , ... usually .
i 'd give _num_ stars if i could .
rude , rude , rude .
do not bother with her terrible attitude and old ice cream .
just had the worst service ever !
when i walked in , no one was at the counter .
truly rude .
this past week i went in there to buy _num_ cakes .
it 's not like the cake was made that night !
she was rude and bothered by the change order !
ridiculous !
i was in vegas on a vacation and went to this baskin robbins .
one bite and i tossed it out .
the customer service is horrible .
an employee made a mistake and over charged me $ _num_ .
do n't want to have to clean after the customers have all been helped .
this place is terrible now .
ultimately , i do n't think i see myself going back anytime soon .
worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life .
if i were able to , i would give this place _num_ stars .
that 's disgusting .
do n't order a cake from this location .
this place has the worst customer service ever .
my bad .
i will never return again .
horrible service !
the customer service is very poor here .
if i could , i would spit on this business .
zero stars even though i have to put one .
go the hell away , or get new management .
we all hate you : ) go away .
service was ok , but both salespeople wore super dirty shirts .
just disgusting .
not my favorite place to go .
i refuse to eat there again .
worst customer service ever .
where the hell is the manager ?
this establishment is garbage .
employees act like their $ hit do n't stink .
customer service ruined my mood to even want to purchase anything from here .
by far the worst baskin robbins in town .
i have tried _num_ times to give this location support .
and when i asked for a refund , the employees are not allowed .
i will not support this location anymore .
this place really needs to train or hire new staff .
the wait times and lines here are ridiculous .
we love baskin robbins but this place ruins it with the horribly slow service .
we got them and paid , no thank you no eye contact .
i have never paid extra for it before .
but to make my order wrong and then try and charge me ?
at this point she said `` then i ca n't do anything '' .
my fianc walked in and eventually we got our money back .
and do n't be rude to customers .
she gave me the wrong schedule , so i missed a day of work .
and then she told me that it was my fault .
she refused to schedule me , so i quit .
if you 're looking to get a cake , go to another location .
her decorating skills are mediocre compared to the other locations .
do not come here , it 's a waste of time and money .
she is disgusting and i ca n't imagine this store staying open much longer .
i know one think cold stone down the street much better service !
rude asian woman runs this franchise .
extremely unpleasant experience - would not go back to this particular location .
made me feel uncomfortable and i will not be returning to this location .
i think it 's his 1st day .
it did n't turn out so well .
i had a terrible experience with anna at the counter today .
long story short , i left without ice cream .
i really do n't care about $ _num_ .
the new staff is bad .
last two times have been a disaster .
the second time it was more vanilla flavour milk then a vanilla milkshake .
but not this location .
horrible service !
i will not be going to this location again .
waste my money .
it 's outrageous and ridiculous !
size wise there is no change and should have no extra charge .
this place is the absolute worst !
she is horrible !
btw if i could give this place zero stars ... i would !
when i picked it up there was n't a nose or eyes on it .
do not buy your cake from here .
i feel bad , i hope she does n't treat her employees poorly .
their customer service skills are definitely lacking as it shows on their yelp page .
i will not be back to this location for treats or a cake .
she offered $ _num_ discount .
very poor customer service by the owner of this neighborhood ice cream shop .
this location seems to be getting worse & worse .
nothing has the same taste !
i was extremely disappointed in this place !
tasteless , disgusting food ?
my boyfriend and i got sick !
horrible experience !
worst mexican food ever !
i just had the most unpleasant experience at this location .
so i parked and went inside to get it fixed .
so i know i ordered the quesadilla .
i did not deserve to be treated the way she was treating me .
it says mexican fast food .
they need to change that to slow as fuck .
however the rolled tacos had no flavor at all .
the only thing that tasted decent was the rice .
even the hot sauce was tasteless .
i really wanted to like this place but my food was too disappointing .
alway a half hour wait .
and the girl who usually works the window is rude .
if i could give negative stars i would .
he ordered the rolled beef tacos , i ordered the steak tostada .
no not _num_ order of the tacos ... just _num_ small rolled beef taco .
so i asked for my money back & she would n't even do that .
i know that normally a taco comes with at least cheese and lettuce .
this would be the second time i have received uncooked crunchy rice .
it is a shame !
the worst place to receive pain management care in vegas !
he told me that i only need to work out my back muscles .
an actual doctor told me i was too young for an mri .
he asked me the same thing , over and over .
they do not care about patients at this facility .
i suggest to take your business and your body elsewhere .
unfortunately i did not have a good experience .
went on _num_ date with a non member and was threatened by another .
no refund and then radio silence .
_num_ months and not one single date .
absolutely a disaster of a company .
do not waste your money .
she took $ _num_ from me on february _num_ .
but still , i was thinking that sounded pretty good .
`` no , '' he insisted , let 's describe ourselves to one another .
now this does n't sound that bad , right ?
this guy was the exact opposite of that , extremely .
oh , there were a couple of exceptions , you told me that too .
do not waste your money .
please do n't pay the stupid tax that i and others have !
we walked in and were told they would be right with us .
very disappointed .
this store pays yelp to remove bad reviews do not trust them !
my fianc and i used to be loyal customers to this store until recently .
terrible customer service and obviously does n't care at all about their customers .
our service is limited to an extended warranty that surprisingly ended just months ago .
again spoke to volvo and they refuse to fix this issue .
they refuse to even look at the vehicle unless we pay $ _num_ .
volvo is very much aware of the problem .
this should have been taken into account before the car was sold .
volvo owners beware .
good luck and stay the hell away from this place .
wo n't make that mistake again .
by friday , i was having the same mechanical problems as before .
not that i didnt try to go to another mechanic first .
he stayed in constant communication with me through the repair process .
they still have n't managed to get the title over to my bank .
i will never purchase a single thing there again .
i know for sure i will not be buying another volvo .
by the way ... this car only had _num_ miles on it .
absolutely horrible service department .
the interior of my car is a light grey , so this was shocking .
unfortunately , it was not another volvo .
the store proceeded to charge me twice for that month for insurance .
ok storage one is incompetent but , stuff happens .
she never checked on the table again , or even looked our way .
she delivered french fries instead .
the hamburger had gristle and unpleasant hard things in it when i bit down .
ugh .
i 'd really give this _num_ stars , but three would be too many .
if i could put half a star i would .
it was disgusting .
their pies have even gone down hill , as well .
now , if they could only get a decent cook and kitchen staff ... .
he had mac and cheese w/ garlic toast and i had fish and chips .
i tried it and i agreed and his garlic toast was not good either .
my fish and chips were the worst i have ever had .
food , aside from the potato cheese soup and cornbread are kinda bleh .
this location is and has been pretty horribly managed for a long time now .
she said `` no , we close at 10pm . ''
the lady manager was extremely rude .
i felt like this place lack the common sense of customer service !
will not feel the need to return to this facility and deal with her .
be aware of poor customer service from this lady and staff members .
she looks like she hates her life .
the waitress returned and said that they were out of peach pie .
needless to say we did not get peach pie and left .
the service tonight was not very good -the waiter pretty much ignored us .
the vegetables taste like they started out frozen .
for over $ _num_ the pot pie is definitely not worth the price .
the server said no problem .
probably will not go back to this location again .
disgusting !
tonight i ordered a pan of cornbread to go .
too bad my daughter and i ate a piece to find out .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
i send it back , and i 'm waiting and waiting and waiting .
finally get my burger and the fries are cold .
you ca n't give me fresh fries ?
not the usual flavorful dishes .
too bad because we eat here often .
why they do n't count for order anyway they ruined our thanksgiving .
lame .
really , it 's not that hard .
it 's predictable .
absolutely horrible service .
very disappointed right now .
wasted almost _num_ hours on my xmas eve .
slow it has been _num_ minutes and still waiting for food .
had to beg for bread .
the coffee was nasty .
my parents love it here but our last experience here was somewhat unpleasant .
that is not the way you treat customers .
my brother forced a smile and just said , `` you know what ?
just forget it .
she walked away still looking pissed , i do n't know why .
my poor nephew ended up not eating anything because he 's scared .
i feel bad that he could n't be helped .
food was so-so .
i got a headache from so much grease .
that said , the place is clean , very clean .
so it 's not a question of sanitation .
the pancakes lack luster and their quiche is n't anything like my mom 's .
my food was dry and cold .
the kitchen is totally disorganized .
we made a reservation for _num_ , they set the tables up for _num_ .
that should have been the first clue that this would not go well .
even the salad tasted odd and not fresh .
the food was bland and tasteless .
we came here for dinner and it was not very good .
we left quite disappointed and saying that we would not return any time soon .
that was just ok .
if i were to go back , it would be to try their breakfast .
maybe its more of a breakfast place , i do n't know .
but we will never return for dinner .
eggs benedict had no english muffin and even the carrot muffin was stale .
the butter was cold and hard .
the food was awful and there 's a lot of old people around .
can not recomend at all .
and she was not friendly .
second off , the food took about _num_ minutes , which was ridiculous .
third off , i ordered a smoothie and she did n't bring it out .
fifth off , she never said sorry for anything .
i could barely taste the pesto and the whole thing needed salt !
this was my `` last straw '' visit to this place .
my husband does n't like it , which is why i went alone .
will not be back .
cup sat empty twice .
service was very slow today .
soon they wo n't have as many to serve .
i almost rated this as a _num_ star rather than _num_ .
but i do n't like giving negative feedback .
i guess i 'll have to cross mimi 's off my casual dining list .
this restaurant has gone downhill fast .
probably due to the current manager , sally who does n't train her help .
were done eating .
place not full like it used to be .
used to eat there regularly , wo n't be back again .
the other was almost cooked enough , so i only ate one .
the artichoke hearts were greasy , super chewy and really lacked flavor .
order crispy bacon and it came out soggy and very salty .
there 's only one problem with mimi 's , and it 's the food !
le disgusting .
i 'm not sure why i keep trying this place .
i was dead wrong .
it was chewy bacon with bland eggs and oily potatoes .
it was not good .
it was slow service .
the food we got was not very good for what we paid .
we have not been back again .
i had the eggs benedict .
well , there goes your french quarter theory , young man .
unbelievable .
i do n't get this restaurant at all .
because it fails with all of that .
she became absolutely disgusted that they did n't serve real butter with the bread .
_num_ ) for dine in .
had it rare , meat was tough .
this location did nothing to help our christmas dinner .
we will not be ordering from mimi 's again unfortunately .
was told there would be a _num_ minute wait for a table for two .
my father was n't impressed with the hash , but said it was okay .
the apple pieces were raw and turning brown .
i always request my eggs like this `` two , hard fried .
very hard fried .
burn them if needed .
lots of staff , but can never seem to get anyone 's attention .
placed order and waited _num_ minutes for a simple breakfast .
no apologies .
i will not be back .
the meat under the bun was piled high with `` onion strings '' .
the `` strings '' were very greasy and ruined the burger .
the caf could shine if the chefs were allowed to prepare food properly .
poor service all around .
one waiter with the manager waiting on tables too .
come on , higher more staff , please ?
terrible service .
finally a server noticed me and sat me .
when we got in the place was completely dead .
not a good sign about the service .
it took _num_ minutes prior to being asked about drink orders .
it took another 5-10 minutes to get those and only after asking for them .
my salad was pretty horrible .
our entrees came out about _num_ minutes later .
the fries were soggy from the spinach on the plate ... meh .
why ? )
no discount was on it .
not anymore .
the only thing we ordered that i really enjoyed was the peach mimosas .
they were definitely pre-made & not fresh .
there was no bacon or parmesan crust & it was n't appealing at all .
not even close .
so gross .
i literally took _num_ bites then brought the rest home for my dogs .
we refused dessert after the train wreck meal we just had .
the service was also complete crap .
really gone downhill .
menu changes were big mistakes .
every meal we have is terrible last few times so we stopped going anymore .
they have went down since the business was sold .
i do n't know where to start with this review .
there were _num_ servers and now we made the second table .
when we ordered they brought us cold hard bread .
getting a refill was like pulling teeth .
when the food came it was cold and sent back to be heated .
but i guess i might end up going anyway .
then it was super flavorless .
horrible .
mimi 's used to be one of my favorite places to go for lunch .
but the last two times i have been i have been less than impressed .
just felt disappointed in my dinner .
even the lemonade was not good .
maybe i just chose poorly .
the place was pretty dead , probably around 10-15 customers there total .
he did nothing to fix the situation , or apologize for their obvious mistake .
i would understand if the place was busy , but it was dead .
ordered the pot roast and the broccoli was like rubber .
i usually never give a bad review but this really made me angry .
i checked the website the hours were posted , it said closed at 11pm .
this place is n't the same .
the whole environment just seems now like a slightly upscale dennys .
wo n't be returning .
but , one thing was the worst was the bathroom .
no toilet paper , bathroom was filthy .
it looks like it has n't been clean in about a month .
horrible experience !
took _num_ minutes just to get drinks .
no apologies for having to wait so long for a server .
never going back .
failed to bring our bread basket and meatball appetizer until end of meal .
shame on you mimi 's cafe summerlin !
negative zero stars !
after that , it was another _num_ minutes before we received our food .
the only reason we did n't was that we could n't get her attention .
bad dining experience , will not go back .
she was very accommodating and apologetic for what i 'm about to write .
it 's friday night , pretty empty place , no damn chicken .
i 'm so disappointed .
so gross .
wth happened , mimi 's ?
mom brought home chicken and this potato casserole thing .
could n't even eat it .
chicken was under cooked !
and the worst fries i have ever eaten .
went to mimi 's on _num_ and rainbow few yrs back .
it was not good either .
i 'm not sure what happened to this place but it 's gone downhill !
but our wait time get our food was unacceptable .
it was our 2nd time in about _num_ weeks and both times were bad .
unfortunately there wo n't be a third .
he then tried to justify that they had eaten their food already .
i walked out pretty pissed and i will never return .
i walked in , signed in and waited for what seemed like _num_ mins .
i felt rushed .
i told her no , and then she slipped me a paper .
total disappointment and a rip off .
like any soon to be mother , i was a nervous wreck .
so i 'm not understanding this procedure .
even trying to pay was a problem .
what a terrible business practice of dr 's offices !
too bad we ca n't switch now !
people are taking time off work to sit around in the waiting room .
very disappointing !
he seems to really care about your care as well as your little one .
omg i 'm sorry but they are horrible !
seems fishy to me .
worst ultrasound experience ever .
she goes out to talk to the dr on staff .
so i 'm like , ok did you call my dr ?
holy shit i 'm going to be mother right now ?
crap , do i have everything packed ?
i go home and hear nothing from my doctor .
i would not recommend this place at all .
this is n't the first time they made me wait this long .
i arrived early as i know later in the day they get fairly busy .
i was getting an inspection whether i wanted it or not .
i guess those days are gone .
i can get bad service anywhere and spend less money getting it .
are these people even skilled mechanics ?
my experience is related to tire and alignment issues .
bad news .
went in for a flat tire .
it could n't be repaired , so i had to get a new tire .
no big deal there .
if you 're not low , then you have a very slow leak .
there is no other explanation .
everyone raves about ihop , but i think it is totally overpriced and disgusting .
disgusting ... who wants to eat cold eggs with their french toast .
i was so disappointed .
we walked in and were ignored from the word go .
then both the manager and the cashier made rude comments .
we turned and left as well as the couple that walked in behind us .
if the rating system allowed negative stars this place is a negative _num_ .
do n't even consider eating here .
i have been here a few times and every time i regret it .
the service is beyond slow .
literally waited over an hour yesterday morning to be served _num_ omelets .
it was n't even that busy so no excuse .
mind you , this was after already waiting _num_ minutes .
wo n't go back unless i have all morning to waste .
a guy behind us was upset and got out loud about it .
i do n't even know where to start .
within _num_ mins of being here i have yet to have my order taken .
we were starving & i 'm always into having breakfast for dinner .
with that said we arrived & i was craving crepes !
when our food came we requested ketchup & steak sauce .
this is where everything went downhill .
worst location i 've ever been to !
i should have looked at the reviews before coming to this location .
my husband order was fine but my wasnt .
it literally came with burnt chorizo and peppers on top .
i tired to flag down the waiter but was ignored .
and that they just forgot the sour cream and pepper .
the meal did not look appetizing .
plus no sausage , burnt bacon , and horrible eggs .
bad service , horrible food , and poor plate presentation .
avoid this location at all cost .
this was honestly the worst service i have ever received .
after another _num_ minutes they came to take our food order .
according to some friends at another table , she asked `` really ? ''
she never ordered food because she was too shy to call attention to it .
worst ihop i 've ever been to .
i figured once at the table , i would n't smell it .
no apologies .
anyway , i asked for the free kid 's discount .
it really smells ... bad !
horrible service .
bad attitudes from the waitresses .
did n't get orders right .
very rude .
waiting for such a long time for only drinks .
would not recommend this ihop .
ihop is still totally overrated .
wrong place to go .
bacon & eggs , _num_ coffees & a waffle ... $ _num_ .
this place is a total rip & the food was n't that good .
i made an appt and they never showed up and never called to apologize .
i would not recommend this property .
for this late fee i was charged $ _num_ dollars .
the main problem with the complex is security and cleanliness .
poor customer service !
i would n't use her or recommend this place .
this place is a major rip off !
major rip off !
walked in to get a pedicure and the guy told me _num_ minutes .
it had n't been cleaned so i asked her to clean if for me .
absolutely gross and i had to walk out .
horrible customer service experience without even getting my nails done .
i was told they do n't do gel pedicures , and that sucks .
for $ _num_ i expect much better .
it 's been only _num_ days pretty much all my manicure came off !
by far the worse experience i had !
do not recommend !
we found them outside in full sun dry as a bone .
they also never gave me my copy of the receipt back .
they lost a customer .
wrong !
i want to purchase and put on will call a nice big prickly cactus .
the manager rushed over to help her and said he would be right back .
so i walked around until i found the russian sage .
then just tell me that instead of a lie !
worst customer service ever !
i am disabled an could not find any one to help me .
when i got to the register a boy name nick checked me out .
i was offered nothing to compensate the horrible treatment .
walked around for _num_ minutes trying to get help .
this outside employee was surrounded by customers all needing his attention .
some may find the distance from the strip a disappointment .
i , however , did not .
were the ticket people rude ?
were the prices ridiculously high ?
not that the quality of art was bad .
but i could n't really get into it or enjoy it .
sorry , but the attendant totally killed the experience for me .
it was n't that the food was bad .
the enchiladas were okay but i probably would n't order that again .
my mom had baja enchiladas which she loved .
we all got the chicken tortilla soup to start , which was very good .
the salsa served with the chips was less than stellar .
lunch for _num_ costs $ _num_ here not including tip .
- the servers were okay but you can tell they hate their job .
- i had _num_ chicken enchiladas .
i would say this is below average mexican food .
i would skip this place .
no bueno .
_num_ bland food , everything taste canned or packaged .
do n't waste your money !
worst mexican restaurant meal i have had in my lifetime guaranteed !
the happy hour specials are reduced priced drinks and half off appetizers .
on a side note , the food is mediocre at best .
way too much of it on everything .
this is mexican food done american to the max !
big disappointment food is not fresh tastes like canned tomatoes and instant rice .
place is not to clean either tables are sticky .
food did n't have much flavor and service could 've been better .
i was torn between a _num_ and a _num_ .
the chips were very pedestrian .
the salsas could have been made from canned tomatoes .
no , not a strip club or girlfriend , macayo 's mexican restaurant .
macayo 's is just bland .
no spice .
no atmosphere .
baby , you 've lost that loving feeling .
no , i just said that i did n't want that .
stopped here for dinner the food was below average as was the service .
no tip was left which is rare for me .
drinks are weak !
food is bland !
we learned she was attending a large group and she just abandoned us .
however , it got worse !
the server was far from apologetic and i was sorry we came .
i really wanted to like this restaurant , but it was just okay .
the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada .
everything else was meh .
i probably wo n't be back again .
she gave more attitude and we talked about not going back .
our food was terrible ( overcooked , etc ) .
in summary : poorly prepared food and even worse service .
no authentic mexican taste at all .
the chips are usually decent but this time around they were cold and stale .
this place is worse and worse .
i do n't know what we 're tipping for when it is this horrible .
this place is terrible .
the food is awful .
i ordered the steak fajitas and it was not good .
very disappointed !
i really dislike this restaurant .
will not return even if it was free .
i was part of a party of _num_ that met for lunch here .
the service was very slow .
we went for a friend 's birthday as this was what she was craving .
none of the employees seemed to care .
after this wonderful start to the dinner , things did n't get much better .
our chips did n't get refilled , neither did our drinks .
not like i use to remember this place .
wish the flavor was better .
the food was mediocre and not worth the high price .
the waiter was rude and had a bad attitude from the beginning .
we were very disappointed and will not go back .
the food was so bland , with no seasoning .
the chimichanga is not fried , it 's more like a grilled burrito .
( i blame you , husband , for feeding me mediocre food ! )
presentation was very boring as well .
he kept up on refills and cleared up plates quick like .
atmosphere : kind of sad and nothing special .
decor is drab and the layout is weird .
nope , not happening .
yeah , um no .
we stopped by here for dinner with our friend who lives near by .
this was sent back , was lacking cheese .
i ordered the grilled salmon with green enchiladas .
i would be hard pressed to return here or recommend .
our margaritas were weak , with way too much sour mix .
our mean was mediocre .
i ate half my burrito and did n't bother to take the rest home .
save your money and go to taco bell .
the chips were excellent , the guacamole was just average .
the rest of the food was mediocre at best .
there are much better choices for sit down mexican food in town .
if you want cheap horrible mexican food this is it .
no one checked on us we were just given the cold shoulder .
smh sad service macayo .
it was awful .
the first sign was the chips & salsa .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
gross .
the only good thing they have going for them are their chips .
not sure who 's putting up these positive reviews ... this place sucked .
service was slow and not at all friendly .
, but i 'm just going to leave it as this .
worst taco i ever ate .
wo n't be going back .
we advised the waiter who and what would be on which check up front .
my mom got fajitas and they were overcooked and mushy .
what ?
no , i wan na go home now .
i was the first to hand off my debit card .
you could n't pay me to return .
last visit was not very good.
how dare you call this mexican food .
my wife enjoyed the chicken burrito , but my combo fajitas was really flavorless .
and everything was bland and had no real taste .
the whole dish was just blah .
the beef chimichanga was not at all what i expected .
it was more like a giant hamburger stuffed burrito .
they did take the item off my bill , but my meal was ruined .
i hate even giving this place one star !
vets are supposed to help the animals because they want to .
me : `` i am paying for an exam . ''
dental exams are free but of course the cleaning is $ _num_ .
staff was fine , we were in and out .
not a good sign .
disgusting !
this occurred _num_ years ago .
we made the mistake going back to him and oh wow .
why are you a vet if you seem to not like animals ?
obviously he wo n't be boarded there again .
this place is horrible horrific and just bad !
( we could tell his jaw was broken ) _num_ .
the x ray is $ _num_ up front !
he was in really bad shape .
plus everything else ... just a shame .
a little caring goes a long way .
i was so disappointed today to see dr jones .
i could only imagine the worst .
the dr. would n't even consider that might be right .
no concern for my dog at all .
do not board your dogs here !
i boarded my dogs for 3-4 days while i was out of town .
when i came to pick them up , i was horrified !
but , it gets worse ... .
are you kidding me ?
this makes me sick to think what happened during these last _num_ days .
i am very disappointed and do not feel comfortable boarding my dogs here .
when they opened .
the nurse came in like no big deal .
a nurse should know when an animal needs medical attention asap .
he gave me some meds .
he was stable after the _num_ hours .
that was friday and i had to wait till monday .
another $ _num_ later and having to put him to sleep .
this time the staff was so unprofessional .
i lost my best friend .
honestly only go here if you have no other choice .
extremely unprofessional behavior coming from any medical facility .
this is more like a meat market than a vet !
i have never been so disgusted with a vet in my life .
our dog had been to see our vet early in the week .
our vet is closed on the weekend and our baby needed fluids badly .
that is why we chose to come here .
she would hot even be there _num_ hours .
one of the front desk girl was extremely rude , will not be back .
would not recommend this non personality animal hospital for any animal .
my bill should have been no more than $ _num_ .
it was $ _num_ .
not very sanitary .
really disappointed !
on to find a better place in town .
they were n't very helpful .
it 's really quite sad that this shop has so many positive reviews .
it makes me feel like maybe there 's something wrong with me .
anyway , my main problem with them is about my sister .
when the person answered the phone , they were completely incompetent .
all around the place is just not a good business at all .
first of all , we walked in and there was no one there .
it makes no sense .
i do n't know their name but i would n't go there . ''
and she says `` i know nothing about them .
i say five stars and then she says she would definitely recommend them then .
wo n't be going back .
is n't that one of the most popular piercings ?
second of all , it 's super hot and uncomfortable in there .
excuse me ?
hell .
their security system does n't work .
nor could they provide any video to the police ( hard drive crash ) .
we lost lots of good things and they did n't seem to care .
the box still might have tasted better .
wan na know what i get ?
5-6 pieces of chicken .
very little bacon .
in other dominos , i get what i ask for .
not here .
no sauce whatsoever .
i hate that this dominos does n't deliver what i ask for .
i have to drive elsewhere for my hot wings and pasta .
not cool , dominos .
not cool .
the worst pizza delivery experience ever !
i called them quickly to figure out what happened .
i ca n't quite put a finger on it .
so the boys refuse to eat it .
i check my order and it says nowhere `` no sauce '' .
_num_ hungry kids screaming i want food .
yes , just because i have no choice but to use this store .
worst service i have ever gotten .
the employees like to lie and the district manager also lies .
we ordered _num_ pizzas _num_ different names they only allowed _num_ pizza .
y o u know who you are ... .
it really sucks that they slow down their web page close to closing time .
dominos pizza you suck .
_num_ out of _num_ times i never received my sauces .
so congrats to dominos for being the pizza stealing company of the year !
( $ _num_ is n't a lot of money but it is ) .
i am sorry i am disappointed .
no use of public restrooms .
the mini mart has potential .
i 'll never use this place again .
that 's where the good part stopped , though .
it feels dingy and dirty .
not exactly fresh looking .
i 'd probably just go to one of those instead .
the food was ok enough , atmosphere was ok enough .
but will not be going back .
does n't it ?
if you do go here , i would recommend skipping the hushpuppies .
would probably skip anything fried .
to be quite honest , my experience was slightly disappointing .
others were not so flavorful .
as for the shrimp , i should have known better .
but i would n't come back here for catfish , let alone ayce catfish .
i believe that lazy joe 's fish & chips has better catfish .
the thing is , i 've never liked hush puppies .
i do n't get the appeal .
read others reviews and decided to give it a try and totally regret it .
my husbands food was greasy and too salty .
very disappointing for the price .
the only things good here are snow crab legs and sweet tea .
this one now tops the list of the worst i have ever been to .
the service was nonexistent .
the tartar sauce was tasteless and was full of big chunks of onion .
the shrimp was decent but the ribs were dry .
my glass of iced tea was never refilled even once .
the tables were greasy and smelly .
i have never been so disgusted in my life .
this place would even be turned down by the television show restaurant impossible .
do n't even give them a first thought .
should have been a warning sign .
no waiting on wednesday at around 5:30 .
lettuce , potato salad , macaroni salad .
the ribs were plentiful and dry .
very bland , not enough seasoning .
i did n't like any of it .
we could n't wait to visit again this time .
i do n't even want to know how old .
sadly , we 've lost our craving for this place .
it just is n't the same .
terrible restaurant !
the service was not very good either .
very bland , greasy , and the salad bar did not look appealing .
it was obvious that this platter had been frozen & shipped in .
but not recently .
i really do n't see the hype with this place .
the food tasted stale and old .
but it just tastes disgusting .
i 'm almost at a loss of words for how bad the food was .
the only pro to this establishment is the staff .
if only the food could match the customer service .
fried green tomatoes were ok but again no seasoning .
snow crab was ok , bland , nothing to brag about .
wo n't be going back .
i 've had enough ... i can no longer do it anymore .
the fish and shrimp are overcooked .
the greens i had with my meal were older than a few days .
i will not be returning .
she said the hush puppies were huge and to die for .
thumbs down !
bad sign from the start .
maybe that was the intended feel , i do n't know .
menu options were fairly limited .
i ordered seafood gumbo and crab legs appetizer .
my friend ordered fried catfish and fries .
clearly by the picture i posted , they are not huge .
gumbo was just okay .
i 've never cooked it and bet mine would taste comparable .
that 's not saying much .
the rest were ice cold at the bottom and lukewarm up the rest .
i sent them back and requested a new batch .
obviously , she was n't concerned with her level of integrity with that lie .
the owner or manager walked around and greeted people .
staff was friendly and welcoming others as we left .
my corona was nice and cold so a star for that .
it tasted like frozen food deep fried in questionable grease .
i could n't wait to leave .
needless to say i wo n't be back .
no apology .
no thank you .
no ownership .
i will never return to any of their locations .
the catfish is odd tasting .
the bake potatoes are hard and under cooked .
no eggs , turkey , ham or fresh dressings are available for you .
salad should not be hot or room temperature .
i totally lost my appetite .
wrong !
i do n't see how this place is still open .
was n't real impressed .
half the containers for dressing were n't label on the bar .
my guess is that half of them were ranch and the other half italian .
the ratio of batter to frog legs was not a good mixture .
too much batter that was .
would have preferred to either have bigger legs or less batter .
no real flavor .
fortunately it was only $ _num_ so yeah maybe it just was cheap wine .
all and all i was n't impressed and do n't plan on coming back .
he just looked at me and did n't say a thing .
totally unacceptable to have someone in charge who ca n't solve problems .
i 'm just sad because this was my special place .
we both kind of lost the taste for fish .
im sorry but i really was n't feeling the atmosphere nor the food .
the environment was less than inviting and the staff was n't friendly .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
that was in _num_ .
the units have never worked properly .
as far as wells fargo goes i 've never had an issue with them .
however this particular branch is completely incompetent when it comes to customer service .
no thank you .
i wish i could give this bank no stars .
i am going to now pay their stupid fee and close my account .
slow service _num_ days a week .
i have nothing but back to back bad experiences with this bank !
the worst customer service .
no one is knowledgeable of what they 're supposed to do .
the bank has not even sent me bills to my home .
customer service on the phone is terrible .
surprised the lakes would have such a hole in their community .
the restaurant was closed so we ate in the bar .
not quite what we had anticipated based on the previous reviews .
i would do no stars if i could , but i ca n't .
`` , she said no just water and tea .
i will not be going back there .
like my last review service really tends to suck .
came here because of all the good reviews .
it was so tough , i could barely eat it .
my bf said his dip was n't good either .
he said the meat was n't good at all .
i never ate such disappointing food like this and tough steak in my life .
really disappointed in the food .
april _num_ update - sadly , lakes has decided to change their breakfast potatoes .
they are a greasy mess of potato bits fried with onions and green peppers .
not edible .
when it was delivered i noticed that the pillows did n't fit properly .
no call , so i called again .
no call as of yet !
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
horrible service .
ive been using this place for two years hoping it would get better .
avoid !
horrible - absolute crooks in the service dept .
i had always trusted that they did .
anyway they were finished with the oil change in record time .
last time i checked , they are considered fluids , are they not ?
my radiator fluid is low , and so is the break fluid .
they 've done me wrong on so many different occasions .
if i could give negative stars i would .
skip this place and take your car somewhere else .
i brought my car in for a simple fix not motor related .
they told me to sign the paper and they would get back to me .
my car is barely worth that much .
i would have never thought of them charging me for that .
and shame on them for not telling me they charge for an estimate .
though the test drive went well , not much else did .
should have checked yelp ratings before buying a car here .
i am pregnant and i am tired of waiting .
i hate this dealership !
after shopping around online , i saw this accord that i liked .
then they tried to sell us on another honda with less features , etc .
i returned the car and got my deposit back .
brought my honda in to get the brakes fixed .
he was really mad .
not even a simple hello , or may i help you .
i got online , the email matched what the biz card said .
i called & ask to talk to general mgr chip .
instead , he said , `` uh , i do n't know '' .
she then transferred me to the service department .
there 's barely anybody there at that time .
i dropped off my car today and i was waiting at their lounge .
i told her no , i do n't need the service .
i seriously regretted bringing my car over to this crappy place !
wish there 's another honda dealership close to where i live .
avoid at all cost !
i will never , ever , purchase from honda west again .
since my previous honda west review , i have not been back to them .
however , they keep bothering me to purchase another car from them .
no way am i advertising for such a dishonest company .
worst place !
i have dealt with dealers service dept and never experienced this .
next , he gave me a transmission flush .
i walked out paying roughly $ _num_ , and my car runs great now .
how can i ever trust them again ?
never have i dealt with shady people like that .
this tells me that the service department did n't even look at the van !
so i figure ill give them another chance .
the service department = what a joke ... .
liars and lazy .
at any of the honda locations .
it was very convenient being that it was the closest location .
they were probably just too lazy to go through the process .
_num_ hour wait for an oil change .
no loaner vehicles .
needless to say , i did not take it there .
i had previously taken my accord there for routine and other work .
had my honda in to fix a power steering pump .
that noise was not there before .
they gave an estimate of $ _num_ to fix something they broke .
i urge everybody that 's thinking of buying a honda .
to never set foot in this very poor excuse for a dealership .
honda west almost killed me !
apparently your customer 's safety is n't your priority .
worst experience ever !
used car salesmen , that 's all they are .
they are just as bad as findlay honda .
i used the car for free for a week .
be warned !
she was given _num_ different stories and _num_ different estimates on her car .
_num_ hours you can get lots of things done ... you know ?
i am not talking about accessories .
all of these parts should not have been missing for a certified vehicle .
the missing part that bothered me the most was the wheel lock key .
was my safety meant anything to the dealer ?
needless to say i am disappointed and feel cheated on .
not as a car with missing parts .
hands on it .
will never return to honda west .
what they do n't tell you is ... the deal 's not done yet .
you get screwed .
that 's a lie .
dude , $ _num_ times _num_ equals $ _num_ .
that 's a $ _num_ increase and another lie .
tax is _num_ % .
where the hell did the other $ _num_ come from ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
if you 're smart , you 'll stay away from honda west .
you should have played fair , honda west .
negative stars ?
buying experience was ok with nicole grant with a _num_ hour process time .
my fault for taking my acura in to honda for an oil change .
the service is not that great .
where the customer is always wrong because they are idiots .
avoid the service department !
in fact , avoid honda west !
huge mistake .
it makes me wonder how they diagnose problems ?
my answer would have been - change out the power outlet .
honda west needs a complete change in attitude towards it 's customers .
honda west does n't get it .
avoid honda west !
they didnt even call me to let me know my car was finished .
horrible customer service !
_num_ and have not heard anything back by phone or email .
follow up with honda care .
this case will be against the honda care .
honda care and honda west are _num_ different companies .
maybe they do not understand the concept of the warranty nor the customer service ?
to top it off he did n't even apologize !
after reading reviews , we noticed some the same suspicious stuff .
no reply .
one guy that worked there asked me what i was there for .
there are too many places that i can goto to get my car checked .
they made it impossible to buy a car .
it was brutal .
how to lose a sale _num_ .
update , may _num_ .
friday night it got worse , running hot continuously .
thank you honda west , for absolutely nothing .
then they pawn you off to the next person .
terrible customer service .
will not be coming here for any thing .
stay away from these evil dishonest people !
last week we drove from phoenix to las vegas for a short vacation .
on day two , our ac went out .
honda west , las vegas should be ashamed of themselves .
they tried to rip us off !
they give all professional dealers across this country a really bad name !
their _num_ star review says it all .
fast forward _num_ days and the check engine light came back one .
this time we had to hand over another $ _num_ .
i did not care for his manager though .
the tire pressure light kept coming on and i 'd add air .
i would not recommend purchasing a vehicle here to anyone .
the worst experience ever !
only plus side was that they had cold water !
never again will i go to this location .
honda worst maybe ?
sales i had no problem , but be careful after getting your car .
you are getting the worst possible customer service then .
then i politely said , `` i just have one quick question please . ''
`` leave your name and number and i 'll call you back '' .
i am disappointed .
thinking i bought my car here , this is what i get afterwards .
two thumbs down .
so once again i had to wait in my hot car wasting gas .
i went to jiffy lube and was in and out quickly .
they have absolutely the worst customer service after buying the vehicle .
i do not want strangers to buy from them .
not really a good place to go and have your honda car fixed .
i 'd rather go somewhere but not this place .
worse car buying experience i have ever had .
i called the dealer and they never called me back .
then they sent the info over .
at this point it was on day _num_ after i bought the used car .
i would recommend to stay away from them .
they do n't care about you once you have left the dealer .
why would honda west blatantly lie ?
horrible customer service .
used to take my car here all the time , not any more .
used to get good price on oil changes , and the basics .
car would not start so i brought it in .
was told $ _num_ over the phone for diagnostic .
then it was $ _num_ when i got there .
$ _num_ for a starter motor estimate .
ended up being the starter motor , and $ _num_ .
stopped using service financing .
they are n't open sundays so i was stuck without my car .
i have not visited this service dept .
i arrived on time , and was promptly and professionally greeted .
an hour later , i learned that the shuttle had left without me .
i wo n't go back .
they have attempted to cheat me twice now .
second cheat was to quote $ _num_ to fix a/c .
given history with them i left without making the repair .
well , they just blew me off .
do n't tell me i do n't know how the system works .
there was no way i was going to accept that .
moving forward _num_ months , i 'm now getting honda west 's emails again .
they ca n't get that right ... .
just avoid this place !
second , i should have taken their offer and visited other dealers .
he tried to use the guilty conscious on us .
before we can really decide anything we felt that we were getting pushed around .
he said `` i do not care . ''
so thank you for the experience .
after picking up my honda later that day they told me they did a .
worst honda dealership and repair shop in las vegas and possibly on planet earth .
they will overcharge you for services which are not even remotely required .
i do n't like being lied to .
i 've experienced better . ''
wish i could give _num_ stars .
what an incompetent salesperson we dealt with at honda west .
stay far away from this dealership !
if there is a zero that would be my rate for this dealership .
this is the worst dealership in las vegas .
i brought my car to honda west because its still under warranty .
this dealership needs to be shut down .
i had never been mad in my entire life .
do not go to honda west .
bad form .
i only live ten minutes away .
you have been warned by a frustrated and annoyed honda west client .
avoid this place at all costs !
do not go here for your car service !
no one asked me if they could help .
he was already trying to slip out of the situation .
he just walked off did n't say a word .
the manager was just as bad as his staff .
i prefer i would like to give a zero for this .
i really felt bad in doing business with honda west .
i drove one and fell in love !
however , i was disappointed when i went in to talk numbers .
( it 's half way through _num_ , btw honda west ) .
purchased a car on _num_ june .
replaced under warranty .
either way they lost a customer .
this company is horrible .
the finance manager gave me a run around .
but i will not be going back .
& now i am pissed off .
i could have done a better job then she did .
after seeing the doc i still had to wait another _num_ mins .
final thought : unless my arm falls off i 'm not going back .
if i could , i 'd give half a star .
do not go here unless it is a life and death matter .
even then , if you have options take them .
she told me i was charged for a _num_ minute visit .
why am i just now writing ?
this outfit is embarrassing , just saying !
i spent _num_ hours waiting here .
i 've recently had some actually medical issues and she completely blew me off .
needless to say , i am now looking for a new primary .
horrible .
cash patients pay a fee of _num_ .
i do n't like the service .
the quick care opens at 8am .
now , the receptionists at the front desk are extremely rude !
if you absolutely have to go here , i 'd at least avoid her .
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
the doctor on the other hand had a terrible bedside manner .
then she advised me i was all set to go .
the patient service here is extremely slow .
the wait time exceeds one hour .
no `` bedside manner . ''
came across uncaring and spent _num_ minutes with me !
not a long wait which was great .
asked me no questions at all .
sadly this is the only urgent care on my insurance .
seems they just want to drive as many people away as they can .
he saw us as a check not a patient .
very unprofessional and wrong on so many levels .
she do n't sign off computer could mess with her for not signing off .
damn i wonder this persons name cause they hate her .
kim doing stuff that do n't make sense .
damn if was this person i asked to be moved .
nothing but liars , thieves , and scam artists .
later on i received a bill for $ _num_ for my service .
needless to say i will never be returning .
what a lazy , answer - i was furious !
he has not slept much in at least two nights because of the cough .
he has an arrogant , uncaring demeanor and no bedside manner at all .
for lack of a better word , he 's an ass .
they did apologize that they only have one physician on staff .
if i go back , i would n't do it .
we ordered drinks and waited .
the meat was good but not as much as it was in the past .
no dessert and we still rolled out of there full .
will not be back .
place was empty all night .
friendly staff and good food but the wait time was unreal .
after ordering we waited _num_ mins between food deliveries .
total time in restaurant was _num_ hrs _num_ mins .
for how excited i was to try this place out , i left disappointed .
i 've decided personally not for me though .
went there with my hubby and daughter on a saturday night .
this is really where i was n't enjoying our experience .
no thank you .
not to mention we were in there for almost three hours !
_num_ ) _num_ minutes for _num_ sodas and _num_ drink from the bar .
also , never got my ice water , how hard is that ?
_num_ ) waited again like _num_ minutes after cheese just to do chocolate .
unfortunately - we wo n't ever be back to this las vegas location .
if the service stays that bad , how could it not .
first , i could n't get a reservation when i called .
when we got there , they had our reservation and seated us immediately .
the place was virtually empty !
it was about _num_ pm on a weeknight .
would definitely come back for just dessert fondue , but not again for dinner .
it 's also not too saucy -- too much flavor and too cheesy .
the apples make it so it 's not too intense .
i would give it _num_ stars here for that .
i do n't remember except it was bad .
i guess it was so bad i do n't remember it .
worst service i 've ever had .
no new guests !
i do n't even understand the point in treating us like crap .
not worth the money .
giving _num_ star because of the rude service we encountered .
we were asking our server questions & he was extremely rude .
i have never had such horrible customer service where i 've walked out .
could n't have done that a bit earlier ?
obviously no food yet .
if they had not been aware that we were coming , i could understand .
terrible service .
terrible service !
you could tell she was angry that she was a waitress .
food and drinks were just ok but her service was exceptionally horrible .
these people need training bad .
it and the waitress was a terrible and disappointing experience .
horrible service .
long waits even with many open tables and sketchy wait staff .
we rather spend our money elsewhere and get greater value in return .
lets start with the service ... terrible .
had to order a water several times just to be left bone dry .
finally a drink , your tip went from zero to one dollar .
here comes the actual food , that 's when the disappointment went wild .
i need another water , where 's the water ?
left that with the rest of the trash on the table .
no way i 'm stepping foot inside that horrible place again .
you do realize the food was n't filling and the service was crap ?
left there wondering why did n't i just stop by mcdonald 's .
really slow service , and took forever just to get a drink .
was starting to think this place was experiencing a water shortage .
i do n't really like this place ... almost at all !
and that 's why i give the _num_ stars , for the idea .
maybe _num_ parties were seated in the whole place !
all of it was absolute crap !
it tasted horrible !
3rd time i went we did the whole experience again .
this was sooooo awkward for us !
the food was once again just like the last time ... mediocre .
please do n't waste your time or money here !
worst dining experience i have ever had in my life .
incredibly rude staff .
made a reservation for 8pm and was not seated until 8:30 .
the server was cold and seemed less than thrilled to be there .
she was so inattentive that the busser ended up refilling our drinks twice .
he apologized and said it was way to hot .
her name was not on my receipt but her server id was _num_ .
this was our first time and not one manager came by to say hello .
mediocre food .
very disappointed that i spent fifty dollars and left so upset .
unfortunately the rates being charged at this facility are on the high side .
especially boarding fees that include nothing more than a place to sleep .
do not bring your pet here .
this has nothing to do with the doctors !
they put no love and care into it !
wanted to charge $ _num_ went to another clinic got for under $ _num_ .
upon calling back , the woman was extremely rude and cut me off .
but this phone call was very off putting .
if i could give a half star , that would be more accurate .
well starting two years ago his service was horrible .
problem here is i will have questions and he does not answer them .
he never responded to them and today is friday , his office is closed .
it can mess with you for weeks .
he does not care .
then he says to make an appointment and walks out .
the second visit i only saw him for _num_ mins and he walked out .
so i wait and browse .
i have three dogs .
first , they do a mediocre job for the _num_ price tag .
second , there was always something very wrong about one of the pups haircut .
but ... really disappointed in this place .
i could n't even tell my dog was groomed except her butt was shaved !
ridiculous !
i have been using snooty pets for the last four years .
i went straight to the vets office , id rather be safe then sorry .
now , i am aware cutting a dogs hair can be difficult .
i have to say the custom service is terrible .
she looked very unhappy to be there .
she pushed the dog down to the table .
how dare you write back such a snooty comment ( no pun intended ) .
they demanded that we pay the hospitals past due surgery fees .
do not leave your groomers alone in the store !
i 've never had a major complaint but today my food was not good .
i will not come back to this restaurant anymore .
how do you not have fortune cookies at a chinese food restaurant !
stupid !
terrible service .
food was n't worth the crappy service .
a few mins later , she brought me the beef w/ broccoli .
as far as the quality of food was just terrible .
the hot & sour soup was mostly liquid .
no meat , no mushrooms , no shrimp , etc .
the beef w/ broccoli was very plain .
the broccoli was old , i could taste it .
a credit union gone bad .
and be warned that tellers have no interest in helping .
very disappointing recent experience at around 1:30 pm on a wednesday afternoon .
my sandwich would usually feel as heavy as a brick .
i might as well have gone to subway .
save your money and go elsewhere .
however this location is horrible !
this place did no such thing .
there was barely any mushroom and almost no cheese in it .
never coming back here again .
the black female employee told me _num_ more minutes .
now the black female is giving me dirty look and rolling her eyes .
this is very unfortunate .
the sandwiches are n't worth poor customer service in my eyes .
the worst sandwich ever !
i ordered a meatball sandwich and it was the worst tasting sandwich ever .
the sauce was burnt as was the meatballs .
i spent $ _num_ on this sandwich and had to throw it out .
bad customer service .
try another location for the same sandwiches .
terrible service .
no attention to customers .
walked out .
quickly .
this place is the worst .
that was just money in trash .
bad !
bad !
bad !
i know what i 'm there for ... the bobbie .
it 's a mess .
the turkey was nothing special .
no flavors .
did n't know you could actually ever make stuffing taste bad .
it lacked the flavor and the texture i was looking for .
but my sandwich tasted like airplane food .
so many people working today and they all still manage to mess everything up .
spending $ _num_ at the place i just wish they check my order thoroughly .
ordered a salad , not enough meat or sauce on top .
plenty of lettuce , not enough toppings .
lots of meat , toppings , and sauce !
you get unhappy customers .
consistent lack luster service .
my advice is avoid this place if you can .
horrible service !
i should 've went to mcdonalds !
do n't even get me started on the tacos .
go to in-n-out or fatburger instead .
we 've given this place multiple chances and they are definitely hit or miss .
now i am new to vegas and was n't familiar with the location etc .
but doing this twice ?
why is it so difficult to get an order correct .
went at 11:30 p.m and of course closed , are you kidding me ?
really , pull around for a kids meal chicken nugget ?
the girl is an idiot and she has horrible communication skills .
i finally gave up and walked out the door .
the woman that assisted my husband and i had the worst attitude .
too cheap to pay for a few cashiers to help customers .
there is never anyone here to help you .
avoid !
also they never seem to have stock of the stuff you need .
i made the mistake of buying some major appliances through home depot .
it has been nothing but a long series of problems .
this store is a waste of time .
it 's impossible to find any employees on the floor for assistance .
horrible customer service !
associate was an ass with an attitude .
my experience could n't have been worse .
zero stars !
purchased closet doors , including install , _num_ weeks ago .
i sign the install papers stating i do not accept the work done .
three weeks go by , and no call .
that was four days ago , ... and no call .
biggest rip off store in vegas .
store sells part for _num_ , web site says _num_ .
not low paid kids with no knowledge .
he had mr. jordan who is absolutely awesome , hence the _num_ stars .
cleanliness is borderline .
management is pretty bad .
after getting notified about our class being canceled we called to reschedule .
think the end count on calls was around _num_ over a few days .
and do n't bother leaving a message as they wo n't call you back .
after two weeks there was no response .
it was n't until i canceled our classes that they called me .
all the more reason to fix , right ?
did n't get the feeling they really cared .
overall , this place is really lax , horribly managed and not very clean .
no worries , i was n't in any hurry anyway .
so we stood there waiting for about _num_ minutes until someone finally helped us .
in fact , she just seemed so distracted .
worst place ever !
parents do n't trust this place with your babies !
it 's unfair to everyone .
your child may miss part of class without you even knowing .
staff just seem burnt out .
the customer service is really lacking .
they really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back .
the facility is sometimes clean , and sometimes not .
the play area toys are grimy , more often than not .
then , it took a few minutes to sort it out .
now we 'd wasted _num_ minutes of a _num_ minute lesson .
but i am not okay with spending $ _num_ on a _num_ minute lesson .
the worst part ?
nope , nothing .
locker rooms lack in every way .
i was hoping to not have to write unfortunate review .
additionally , the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary .
the front desk staff is hit or miss .
they did n't move him up after repeated requests .
the locker rooms are horrible and nowhere to put your stuff .
i have talked to a couple of girls who just do n't care .
things did n't get any better here .
she called in sick several weeks and quit .
after _num_ months of lessons @ $ _num_ per half hour i gave up .
it 's been _num_ or _num_ days and no manager call .
it was just `` eh '' .
they would n't just move me up a week .
so because of their policy , that 's _num_ paid classes down the drain .
i just was n't impressed .
so loud between instructors trying to explain and kids trying to learn .
i then lost all interest in the class .
the front office and their terrible policies and the fact that nobody knows them .
wait you charge me because your computer system sucks ?
he was a late walker but that should n't prevent him from moving up .
probably just another example of their terrible policies .
this groupon may well be the one that i completely wasted money on .
the only class we could find time to attend was the tapas .
groupon = 1/2 price for any class up until expiration date .
do n't buy a class here .
two weeks after that , i made a phone call , leaving a voicemail .
i have n't received any response to anything .
so crazy expensive and very rude .
they quoted me a $ _num_ per person .
i just can not believe people would pay their prices .
horrible customer service !
if there was an option for no stars i would give it .
then i stood at the customer service desk and it was even worse .
what ever happened to customer service ?
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
most of the reviews on yelp seems to be by their own staff members .
the only person that talk to me was another customer , that they ignored .
hope this place shut down , what a horrible place .
horrible sales person today .
after walking around i did n't really see anything i needed .
he then told me he did n't know where he was .
i informed him i would be willing to wait for the manager .
i waited for _num_ minutes and still nothing !
i 'm just disappointed in the lack of integrity and professionalism this guy had .
he does n't have you or your customer 's best interest at heart .
people like him can ruin your business .
one clerk was checking someone out and the other was just standing there .
not even going into the details of the bike _num_ .
it rental bike that been beaten down .
it would have solved my problems and headache .
i really was about too go off or walk right out the door .
i was amazed too think if this is the way they treat rental customer .
cause never know maybe get hooked on it come back get mountain bike .
talking too the workers get you nothing but headache ... .
terrible customer service .
wo n't buy anything again.
this place is _num_ minutes from my house , so convenient !
finally , we just left .
nice store - lots of stuff , but no one interested in selling anything .
sorry guys but you need to hire some salespeople .
i expected to be very impressed with this business , sadly i was n't .
i only learned there was a problem when it was mia _num_ days later .
so sad too .
i had already picked out the replacement bike which i 'm going to buy .
and i will , but i will not buy it here .
this was the 2nd time going there and the staff was less than helpful .
that was never offered to me .
he could n't answer my questions .
i guess the good news is i left with all my money .
the lines are always terrible .
there are never enough tellers .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
they never have more than one or two tellers and you wait forever .
i just walked out after being in line for at least _num_ minutes .
the worse bank of america location .
same as all the the other banks .
long lines and one teller ?
if there was a zero star ... this place would earn it !
it never fails !
you must have at least _num_ mins in your schedule to stop here .
and that is only with a short line of _num_ or _num_ people .
too americanized .
i ordered the kabob platter which was very bland .
when she pointed out the mistake the waiter took it back with apologies .
the waiter then very quickly returned with the correct order .
the waiter was nowhere to be found .
i was a very disappointing experience after all the great things i have heard .
i 'm hoping it was just a bad day .
the food is nearly terrible .
kabobs and such are not done right here .
mediocre .
too much quantity over quality .
waitress did n't know much about the food .
we wo n't be going back .
that 's where the good stuff ends , though .
service from that point was a slow and lacking .
i am not sure if i 'll give it another chance .
stick to the hookah , get food somewhere else .
i am sad to say one of my old time favorites went down hill .
great for appetizers and hookah , bad for dinner .
a broiled steak kabob was also ordered .
it 's gone downhill .
our server did not once stop and ask how we were doing .
after he took our order , he literally disappeared .
no offer of dessert , nothing .
first regret , the specialty cocktails .
margaritas were ridiculously too sweet , and i read through the ingredients .
my boyfriend said his pizza was basic and bland also .
followed up with a complaint to their corporate office .
next time we could receive a comp dinner for _num_ .
that 's not the point .
there are no lunch specials , so expect to pay full dinner prices .
the food did n't really do anything for me .
maybe it 's me though .
ate here recently .
second , the service was terribly slow .
we are talking _num_ minutes to get a glass of wine .
save yourself some headache by not `` walking in '' to begin with .
great menu of choices and specials , but highly mediocre food , at best .
this , unfortunately , is what they 've become .
parking is easy , no hassle in the private lot , no valet necessary .
the curry is bland and so was the hummus .
poorly made and nothing like the fine concoction of our last visit .
_num_ minutes later it was still not there .
worse , food tasted as it was prepared in advance and was just heated .
it 's a _num_ out of a _num_ on a good day .
it 's a _num_ out of _num_ .
i 'm very easy going but their service is just unbelievable .
it 's _num_ out of 1,000 .
lost cause and reason for the _num_ star .
i went with _num_ girlfriends and we sat in the lounge .
it was quite a late dinner and the cafe portion was pretty empty .
beef kabob was overcooked .
it 's ridiculous .
i thought we would take a chance once more and what a disappointment .
it was hot and only hot , no flavor .
but honestly the worst hookah in las vegas .
completely ridiculous .
we just left and went to another ( and better ) hookah lounge .
me and some of my friends went here last weekend to smoke hookah .
when they finally brought them out to us they were super harsh .
we were annoyed and were just gon na get our check and go .
we could have literally walked out without paying and nobody would have even noticed .
what a disappointment .
so done with these idiots .
but definitely not good enough to make up for horrible service .
the food was ... not good .
it was n't even very spicy as i requested .
i know when rice is n't fresh .
lamb , beef and chicken kabobs - same thing .
that rice ... oh , that rice .
but , they were not that pleasing to the taste buds .
he was prompt though .
i do not recommend this place .
it 's outdated and maybe it was good at one time .
if so , they 've taken a turn for the worst .
it took _num_ minutes to get a beer after i ordered it .
so so service , ok ambience , food was bad .
what a solid disappointment !
this was our favorite greek restaurant .
it 's literally been _num_ years .
if i could leave worse than a _num_ star i would .
i called in a lunch for _num_ people _num_ hours in advance .
i then asked for the owners name and received a blank stare .
long story short , their awful customer service cost me business .
reps should avoid this place at all costs .
food was cold and lacking of flavors .
