ok never going back to this place again .
easter day nothing open , heard about this place figured it would ok .
the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
it just gets worse .
the food tasted awful .
no sign of the manager .
the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
it smelled like rotten urine .
i am not exaggerating .
this smelled bad !
it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
it tasted horrible !
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
i will never be back .
do yourself a favor and just stay away .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
the total for this lunch was $ _num_ .
it 's not really french food and the decor is n't really french either .
waitress ( jen ) was nice but we waited very long for the food .
really stressed to leave them off the plate .
short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree .
steak cooked wrong , under temp .
if we were to get this server again , i 'd ask to move .
we waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got _num_ .
about _num_ minutes after sitting down , our orders were taken .
not so !
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
drive out , pay , grab food and leave .
no everytime my food still needs to get ready .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
i will not recommend them to any of my friends .
no , no .
not to sound like a broken record ... but everyone here is right .
i would honestly give this place zero stars if i could .
my girlfriend said , `` we 'd like to sit outside . ''
`` oh , my bad .
we walked out .
so , ended up going to a place called scramble .
so rude .
it wasnt busy so i dont get why they had any dirty tables !
at that point , we were irritated and just got up and left .
ten minutes later , another couple was seated at the next table .
i told him that salmon does not take this long to grill .
for all those reasons , we wo n't go back .
the waiter must have said `` i 'm sorry '' literally _num_ times .
it was getting annoying , actually .
it sucks , big time .
no outside beverages allowed . ''
major points lost there .
you ca n't truly ever redeem yourself after that .
for _num_ drinks it was over $ _num_ .
_num_ seconds later they start telling him they 'll get more from the back .
the only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom .
i remember the restroom being clean .
all in all this place was a failure .
i will never go back to metro now that there is another option .
service is horrible .
even with the great beer price , i will not go back .
also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
i would n't waste my time .
the service sucks , management is terrible .
i suggest you do n't even waste your time .
this place is large enough for everything .
too bad it seems like the place is not cared for .
took forever to be served and the place was dead .
waitress tends to hang out at the bar versus wait on the tables .
the only full service car wash near my house .
little slow but there was great attention to detail .
i got my car back and was extremely unhappy .
the side mirrors , rear view mirror were not washed and dried .
only one reason for the second star and that was the considerate employees !
they are ok for cleaning the outside , but they rushed the interior detail .
the owner was incredibly rude to me .
horrible .
unfortunately someone stole the change from my coin slot .
i was in on february _num_ , _num_ .
was told they could detail my suv for _num_ .
paid then they told me they do n't have enough people for their detail .
there goes my $ _num_ .
bad management .
they will not tell the owner nor let me tell the owners name .
i guess she was getting off work .
very disappointed !
my experience with this hall was terrible !
_num_ ) the building is infested with roaches !
_num_ ) check the mens restroom !
_num_ ) do not hire her bartenders or wait staff !
they are completely unprofessional and have no experience .
she did clean the mess but with the biggest attitude ever .
she will not return any calls or emails .
she is a nightmare to deal with .
this banquet hall does n't refund any money for any reason .
there is spray paint on the outside and the floors are very gross .
the staff is disrespectful and unprofessional .
the price is way to high for such low quality .
really horrible apartment complex .
badly infested with roaches and crime in unbelievably high .
the individuals in the office do not care about tenants at all .
they claimed that they lost their copy of my apartment key .
seriously , u 've been warned ... run !
literally !
no lights @ night !
terrible !
i would n't recommend this apartments to anyone !
lived here from july _num_ - july _num_ .
management were slow on their end when you need help with anything .
neighbors are dirty and have no courtesy to your living !
its gross to look at .
piss me off and i talked to their parents .
false advertisement .
this is not the first time we have been kept waiting either .
not much selection here and a lot of dried food items .
disappointed to say the least .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
i stopped him to ask questions and he was condescending and impatient .
it certainly was n't for patient care or respect .
it started out well though .
this total cost for a new system was going to be about $ _num_ .
so i would suggest not taking your car here for any service .
i ended up paying $ _num_ for job .
i would not recommend this business as i feel they are very dishonest .
so i was very thankful !
long story short , do n't go to brakes plus .
they over charge .
their prices are not cheap and their service sucks .
my experience was horrible .
their employees do n't even know how to do their job .
when i arrived i was hoping i was in the wrong place .
the office was old , run down and not very clean .
friday rolls around and i have received no phone call .
i left a voicemail , no call back .
called again on monday and they still have no results .
extremely unimpressed and would not recommend them .
only gave two stars for the ease of scheduling .
their billing staff is useless and constantly getting the billing codes mixed up .
avoid this doctor unless you enjoy over paying for bad customer service .
i 'm not sure why she said that to me .
i am concerned about something , needed help and was treated this way .
they are n't very good at keeping the client informed on their case .
a disappointing electronics store for its size .
then they acted like they could have cared less about helping me .
sorry to say , they lost me as a customer .
neither is customer service .
in addition to this , the price was marked wrong on the shelf .
the store feels like you 're going into a dirty walmart .
if someone 's helpful , it 's because they 're getting commission .
it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in .
we quickly walked past it to the computer area .
we enter the laptop area and walked past five employees .
no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact .
we completely wasted an hour of our time and left .
they were very helpful and offered to match any price from fry 's .
huge waste of time !
looked online for a laptop and checked availability .
they completely ignore you and walk right by you .
_num_ out of _num_ of there employees actually knows something .
customer service sucks .
horrible !
indoors looked brighter and more welcoming , as well .
`` $ _num_ to $ _num_ '' .
( okay not confident in your product knowledge ) .
then he sold me a $ _num_ unit with european maps .
speak with a supervisor , they return my first gps .
this is a pretty short review as i have minimal nice things to say .
if its in the weekly ad they probably will not have any in stock .
... no .
i know that your store 's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally .
it does not mean you should roll your eyes at them .
oddly enough , they do n't match their own online prices .
are you kidding me ?
that 's insulting .
our experience here was a train wreck .
for years , that did n't seem to be a problem at fry 's .
but it 's full of frustration to shop now .
do n't waste your time at this place .
what 's wrong with it , i drove this whole way .
me : hell no !
me : what the hell would that have done ?
that makes no sense whatsoever .
so there you have it , no customer service and no organization .
know your stuff before stepping into these kind of places .
the staff we talked to seemed to lack product knowledge .
i will not be back .
however my iphone sucks !
nothing too tough .
stupid queen .
no ... he works at fry 's electronics .
horrible customer service !
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
customer service is terrible .
thanks for the waist of my time , gas , and money fry 's .
they sell them for the same price , because supposedly they are tested .
just do n't expect any service if you are female .
yet there 3-4 boys standing around with nothing to do .
amazingly poor customer service .
they price match some online places , so be prepared for that .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
$ _num_ for the entire purchase ) from frys electronics .
we also purchased a _num_ year in home service contract .
prices are just plain retail .
bought many items at fry 's electronics but never ever again .
their own techs could not get them to work !
the one at _num_ southwest this place suck .
return are limited days and bad thing of all low experiences .
bad place to go for electronics .
you ca n't reach a human being on the phone .
caused me to call and shop at target instead .
you people are worse than a used car lot .
i had no interest in looking or being there in general .
ive been to run down nasty gas stations with cleaner bathrooms than this place .
when i checked out i said i would like to price match the item .
i told him that was ridiculous and i would just buy it on amazon .
i thanked him and walked away .
fry 's , you just lost a long term customer !
wandered around electronics for _num_ minutes without anyone offering to help me .
had _num_ different employees walk by my .
one just walked by .
never even looked at me .
keep in mind , the place is not busy .
the smile was not returned .
she said she could n't leave the area .
so , he had to go get it again .
at this point , i was ready to walk out .
but , did n't want to start all over at another store .
it was clear this is the way the manager runs the store .
not after tonight .
i am not trying to get free stuff .
someone needs to know how the store is managed .
ridiculous .
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
they didnt ship it out til three days later .
will not respond to any of the multiple emails i have sent .
after _num_ minutes on hold someone answers who doesnt speak english .
he too busy to talk .
and of course no one has still returned my call .
you will get ripped off !
the reason i went in is because of the no sales tax option .
but nothing .
ill find somewhere else to spend my money i guess .
customer service is horrible , and their prices are well above internet pricing .
i will not be shopping here anymore .
that is why they get one star .
their service is awful .
none the employees seem to know anything .
i wandered around for _num_ minutes trying to find a pair of gaming glasses .
i always check every possible competitor before i am forced to shop here .
if you can , avoid like the plague .
horrible service .
next time , i 'll remember not to bother to go to fry 's .
fry 's is the electronics store everyone loves to hate .
i could not find it .
an employee could not find it , and his manager could not find it .
no firearms allowed !
no free wifi .
walked around for 30-45 minutes trying to find what i wanted .
horrible .
they said they could n't find my account .
they turned rude and said that there was nothing they could do .
what a waste of time .
i was there early in the morning - more employees than customers .
i stood there for _num_ minutes .
worst customer service ever .
so i left the laptop department and walked over to the television department .
someone actually approached me to see if they could help .
i 'm typing this as i 'm still in the store not being helped .
i should just punch myself in the junk before walking in here .
if i could leave zero stars i would .
he was the most rude , condescending person i 've ever come across .
run away from this store as fast as you can .
terrible employees , most unhelpful group of people i ever met .
i really do n't like this store .
the store is ridiculous .
if you do n't know do n't try to bs you way through it .
i ca n't sell you the display one even though it has a price .
two negative experiences in a row and yes , you lost another customer .
walked up to the service desk in the computer department .
totally ignored by both the manager and the employees .
researched and looked online at availability .
drove _num_ miles to the store .
me : `` i 'm sorry , an item went on sale today .
went to frys to get a some battery 's and charger .
after _num_ min of waiting i just left .
very bad customer service .
will not shop here again .
the staff needs to be educated on there products and customer service .
i 've tried this place several times .
huge selection - huge fail in customer service .
and do not try to return anything .
i told them several times to cut them down & they would n't .
they have bad service here !
the work was messy !
i checked my credit card today and saw a charge of $ _num_ .
this seems like a scam to me .
week after week i go into these stores and have one problem after another .
my pool is never right .
oh i 'm sorry .
i would rather have the pants and go elsewhere .
went to drop off some clothes today to find out this location has closed !
why would n't i just order through the school then and avoid those fees ?
i really wish our school would find another photographer .
first appointment i went with contacts that just did not work for me .
$ _num_ after insurance for my glasses alone .
_num_ months later i get a bill for $ _num_ .
they are seriously overpriced and painful to work with .
they will not own their mistakes .
worse customer service i have seen in a bike shop !
no call the day they were suppose to be done .
lost business !
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
i guess they figured that they did n't need my business .
i walked out and never went back .
the owner here is always angry and never appreciated business .
walked into just see what they offered .
there were maybe _num_ dresses in size _num_ .
but the sales associate repeatedly told us the problem was our budget .
this is supposed to be a place of healing & relaxation .
worst ever !
not pleased .
the place was dirty , way crowded with crap products .
too much stuff in a small space .
worst customer service ever !
not a fan !
from my experience it is n't worth it to go back .
this is very disappointing and bad for business .
the place it self is ok but she is just terrible person .
rude .
there is no order or procedures .
when you come in there is no hello .
just a `` pickup or drop off ? ''
also they pay little to nothing for clothes .
we ended up getting $ _num_ for _num_ full garbage bags full of clothes .
unfortunately not .
when i arrived at the store , i explained what had happened .
stood at least _num_ feet away and asked me how they felt .
absolutely horrible customer service !
i told the owner forget about it , they lost a customer forever .
this last pair however began losing their sole offer about _num_ months .
for that price they should 've repaired them by replacing the sole .
not gon na buy boots here anymore .
really disappointed in their not standing behind their product .
i purchased two western shirts a week ago .
it was not worn for any length of time .
they were just plain nasty .
it was apparent they did not give a damn about customer service .
apparently they carry seconds and have no customer service .
the guy was annoyed that i even would ask .
but , after much consultation , they decided on _num_ % off .
i just walked out .
employees are lazy here .
that will be the last time i waste my time with that place .
horrible service !
we waited over _num_ hrs for our food and never came .
it 's too small and not very clean !
do not waste your time !
only _num_ other people in the room , so not busy .
after _num_ minutes we gave up , paid for our drinks and went home .
during our visit we saw _num_ plates come out of the kitchen .
that 's _num_ plate every _num_ minutes .
sort of crappy service .
the rice was way too sticky .
not sure why this place is rated so highly .
came here earlier tonight during a storm after seeing the yelp reviews .
a total of _num_ tables - very small place .
another issue , the place felt like there was no a/c .
needless to mention , we ended up leaving .
this was the second time that i 've eaten here .
unfortunately we left over 3/4 of our food in the trash .
we had egg flour soup , crab puffs and chicken with broccoli .
we ate over lunch and spent about $ _num_ .
i ca n't believe this place has almost _num_ stars .
only been here once and not going back .
the food here is not good .
either the fried rice is decent , and the meat is not .
and it was horrible .
the egg rolls were not impressive at all .
will not be going back .
i hand him my ticket and he takes out my shoes .
`` sorry it wo n't go .
if the boot still can not be located , he will ask for compensation .
if i could give no stars i would .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
he put me on hold several times , i repeated numbers several times .
then he told me i needed to come look for my stuff .
got there and he still could n't find my stuff .
i had him check ticket number because he would n't believe me .
no darn it shoes !
no one told me anything .
i refused to pay .
i wish i had looked at these reviews before i went there .
the woman that attempted to help me was rude .
needless to say , i left and will never return .
no one said hello or greeted us in any way .
set up is weird .
if it was busy , you could certainly never play pool .
you would be hitting everyone .
nothing to see here really .
not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties .
they 're just trying to do too much .
the beer is awful .
just a shitty selection .
really effing shitty .
they were dry and had almost no sauce .
he is hung like a horse .
`` ok so why two stars nathan ? ''
the food is average at best , the service is beyond slow .
the whole restaurant/bar needs to be pressure washed .
i wo n't be going back .
nothing about it was worth the time or the money .
everyone is wearing their stupid shirts thinking the suns actually had a chance .
it is here i realized how lame and dumb people can be .
cry me a freakin river !
the food is okay , nothing special at all , but not disgusting .
it 's just weird .
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
i would not recommend this place at all .
the worst place to eat .
greasy and soggy , yuck .
the waitress never showed up and ignored our complaints about the fish .
could n't have cared less .
i wo n't be back .
oh casey jones , how you have failed me .
terrible selection , but the price point was fine .
new menu , which is ugly by the way .
i 'm going elsewhere .
say it ai n't so !
tonight was the last straw .
it 's loud and annoying .
place is sliding backwards .
the return policy here is ridiculous .
no go .
the policy states you ca n't return power equipment after _num_ days .
and the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending .
at least then i 'd get some bang for the _num_ bucks .
we waited another 15-20 minutes and no one ever came .
when we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call .
it is extremely inconvenient .
dont bother and go to home depot across the highway on northern .
i called and they quoted me a price on tile , twice .
really poor customer service !
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the store was n't even that busy at the time .
wo n't be going back to this location .
the store manager norm was extremely disrespectful and rude .
so i stopped turned around and insisted that i speak to a manager .
i was never biased before i certainly am now .
he did n't either , and was very clearly upset about being alone .
like this is not a priority at all .
like the money we spent there is nothing .
why do i even bother with lowes ?
i 'm heading to home depot !
none to be found till you get inside .
the employees have _num_ carts loaded with crap so customers ca n't use them .
never order the _num_ install .
the area was checked with a laser level and was good to go .
its not his fault he works for a company like this i 'm sure .
trying to get someone to help you in this place is a serious joke !
waited _num_ minutes and no one was around .
i should just go to home depot instead .
the worst place you can go to .
the employees there just pass you on to another employee .
not good customer service .
$ _num_ later we were done .
this place is a shit hole the management is nonexistent after _num_ o'clock .
even have another appointment this is the slowest bank in town .
had a problem with someone stealing my daughters social security number .
we went home and then came back i think _num_ days later .
the manager come over and was horrible .
so much drama and disrespect over something that costs the theater maybe $ _num_ !
i checked online and the only place it was playing was the cheap theater .
this is the theater i spent my teenage years in .
walking in , i was n't expecting it to be much different .
the whole experience was awful .
i could not wait for it to be over .
i would not go here ever .
seems like the same old theater that it was in the _num_ 's .
filthy , dirty and disgusting .
$ _num_ admission and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
the picture show , $ _num_ regular and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
pizza was okay ; better than domino 's but nothing special .
the place might have gotten better , might still be the same .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
, cuz this one 's made the do n't believe the hype list .
they got the steak , cheese and peppers just right .
see update below .
house salads were ... house salads .
nothing special there .
however , the service has been getting bad .
the wait staff is lazy and never asks if we need anything .
you know , i used to really like this place .
my previous review was _num_ stars .
johnny , the manager , told me that he would issue a gift certificate .
the subs are n't even what they used to be .
( unless you like soggy bread under your meatballs , of course . )
wrong !
i 'm sure she wo n't issue a refund because - surprise !
nothing special and the drinks are n't cheap .
great wings and decent drinks but the wait staff is horrible !
the tables are all saved by people crowded around the two tvs .
meanwhile they have all this cardinals signage up .
it 's just not worth it to go here .
i would n't go back .
closed kitchen early because they were slow .
we had a groupon and he would not honor it .
lucky for them i did n't actually see any on their menu .
$ _num_ for _num_ large pizza ?
it 's not that good !
i had the white pizza , which is tasty but $ _num_ !
hell no !
next time ill go anywhere else and get _num_ pizzas for that price !
after getting my drink , i went to wash my hands .
not good .
never going back !
this is the worst bar to goto .
the waitresses do n't know how to serve properly and they 're pretty rude .
a lot of their food does n't taste good .
the hamburgers are flat but round .
they have free wifi but constant problems with it .
i left the place shocked and insulted .
total waste of time , definitely not coming back .
the beer was nice and cold !
no stars is what in want to give .
no pre warning .
no , we were not obnoxious .
slow , and will say it again slow .
it was not busy and bartenders seem to not care unless you start complaining .
not the only place in town with televisions .
then she turned around and walked away .
she was not friendly or polite to us .
i didnt want to play anymore .
its just not an inviting place .
ive never said anything before but this time i had to post about them .
the sausage tasted like fake meat and the pasta was over cooked and mushy .
very disappointed .
the server seemed irritated and very inattentive .
absolutely the most frustrating place i have ever gone to eat .
you can not split up your wings in the multiple flavors .
you can order _num_ wings for $ _num_ or _num_ wings for $ _num_ .
but you can not order _num_ wings with two different flavors at $ _num_ .
it 's really too bad that this place does not cater to the customer .
i had high hopes for this place but man was i let down !
was n't gon na see how long it would take for another one .
the food did n't look good .
never will spend another dime at this place again !
horrible experience .
they were n't even fights that people wanted to watch .
food is bland , bland , bland .
no salt or pepper , nothing .
wait times for food - not a friday or saturday - are ridiculously long .
fries were great yet , it 's fries so ?
the wings rule .
chicken tenders are legit too .
charging for ice tea refills ?
it 's only _num_ bucks , not a money issue .
i 'll be back , cause like i said ... .
wait times were too long and the bar was way to dark .
tonight was in unfortunate night .
yes my son got angry .
he said i 've been working here _num_ years and was doing my job .
the ugly : the waitresses were the worst i 've encountered in az .
none of the employees wanted to be there .
big mistake !
i should n't have listened to my boss ' food recommendation .
the food is absolutely amazing !
but our service was the worst i have ever had .
i will not go to this autozone again .
horrible customer service .
poor service and false advertisement .
the thing that really made me sad , though , was the frosting !
it was terrible !
i am sad to say i will not be returning to baker wee .
i will not be going back here .
it 's very dirty feeling and old looking in the inside .
not inviting at all .
there is just junk exposed all over and the menu is very small .
a makeover would do the baked goods justice .
enough to feed about _num_ people .
that 's the only part that was n't wrong !
i 'm really not sure what i 'd call the colors of the flowers .
my husband left after 1pm with a very ugly wedding cake .
wow too bad .
very unhappy !
i got there and it was not done !
this really frustrated me as why lie ?
worst experience ever .
it was sloppy overall .
the heart was even totally wrong .
it was so bad and expensive , and i was so upset .
weird that studio _num_ lets it happen and wo n't call the police .
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
to top it all off , there was a giant box of cats ... .
we booked this room for a week while our bathroom was being remodeled .
the `` women '' at the front desk are extremely rude .
this place is an unsafe dump .
please do n't make the same mistake we did .
the last bill was just under $ _num_ .
go to another dentist if you want to be taken care of properly .
i really want a rug thats not priced .
each time , the guy took a message and never called me back .
not sure why it was recommended .
bad customer service .
the techs there are more concerned with chatting with friends than helping a customer .
waited _num_ minutes for help , then said excuse me .
was told to wait by clerk passing on phone .
they ca n't find it .
but they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues .
first off , when we called , we got the usual sales tactics .
sadly , his tactics worked .
it being around _num_ or 6pm , the place was utterly packed .
it was n't shabby looking , just broken in .
the clientele looks like a bunch of average joes .
the equipment is n't the latest and greatest .
we 're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being .
he did n't go over some of the basics of weight training .
luckily i knew them already .
my session was also about _num_ minutes short .
the first thing i noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot .
the entire building looked old and run down .
i did not get the same service .
the food selection was poor .
they only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up .
most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while .
also the bathroom was a _num_ out of _num_ in terms of cleanliness .
it smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning .
i drove by this place so many times and never noticed it .
sesame chicken was just ok .
egg roll was typical .
crab puff was typical .
they were very friendly and the food was hot .
_num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
she tells well too bad the delivery driver has left .
at this point i 'm thinking good because i am hungry .
_num_ minutes in i call back and just cancel my order .
this is the kind of bullshit that just doesnt need to happen .
the sad thing is in this economy they are struggling .
i guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers .
shame on you pong pong .
yes i am pissed .
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
it feels like the owners have given up .
now it 's all bland mush .
the prices are pretty hard to beat , $ _num_ for two dinner combos !
bad fried rice .
cheap prices .
first time and sadly enough last time .
very bland , i ca n't even finish my dish .
i ordered for _num_ people and none of them liked their food .
would think it could be just me , bit obviously not .
not to my taste .
grew up on real chinese food in california and this is not it .
no flavor .
quality of both beef and chicken seemed low grade .
fried won tons were not crispy .
no return experience for me .
i went in and it was empty .
i will never go here again unfortunately .
go behind the place and just roll down the window .
check out new asian kitchen they have much better food .
meh , was stuck in hotel and needed delivery .
chicken chow mien tastes like cheap hotel food .
not too mention the service is good , friendly n quick .
cheap lunch but the food was pretty bad .
the rice was as dry as the desert .
i will not be back .
oh well , i guess it 's my fault if i keep going back .
the curly fries were good , but the sliders was sub-par .
and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed .
food was awful !
not `` the best of phoenix classics '' as the menu says .
made with processed turkey and ham .
wo n't come back again .
my entree , never get this .
shockingly disappointing !
tipped the bartender _num_ % on our to go meal and waited forever !
no napkins ?
i waited over _num_ minutes .
ridiculous .
she was n't very friendly ... did n't add to the experience .
i probably would have got that .
she comes back five min later with the wrong drink .
still no chips and salsa .
they really earned a _num_ .
i recently had drinks and food with friends here .
the service was awful !
it took over _num_ minutes to get my 2nd drink .
it ruined the calzone for me altogether .
i ordered _num_ wings on the bone .
_num_ suicide , _num_ hot , and _num_ pineapple teriyaki .
i understand this is n't her fault , but the restaurants .
the bill finally came , she had overcharged us for the calzone .
with waters and those meals the total was $ _num_ .
i tipped $ _num_ and got the hell out of there .
i would have given _num_ stars , but my stomach hurts now .
even through the first part of the _num_ 's it was old reliable .
what the hell happened ?
when i got my order , i recieved breaded wings .
when she came back , she seemed pissed and offered me another drink .
i have nearly _num_ years of customer service .
if you make an error , you do n't argue with your customer .
just apologize for the error and offer to fix it .
it was her fault that she failed to ask how i wanted the wings .
there was not very much pepperoni .
musty .
the exterior is worn .
the landscape is tired and needs help .
theres nothing inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all .
the interior is worse .
deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush .
do not go to this place .
i was not offered a menu when i got there .
_num_ , _num_ other locations still open according to the sign .
very sketchy and somewhat dangerous .
i would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this safeway at all cost .
what a pain in the butt .
when i mean never i mean never .
in general it feels small and is usually empty for a reason .
why would anyone want to put their food in them ... yuck .
store is really dirty in general ; floors are gross and shelves disgusting .
then i went to buy sushi and the cashier was rude .
there is no way this place deserves five stars !
i am definitely not coming back .
just gross .
the pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour .
the wings were still hot but unfortunately not as tasteful as they looked .
my brother sister and i were immediately sick after eating here .
the staff was n't the friendliest .
with no care in the world !
that was a complete waste of time and money .
the `` hoagie '' had disgusting processed ham on them .
come on , _num_ $ for a hoagie `` meal '' with processed meat .
so gross !
also the slice specials , were simply cheese .
i always try the current _num_ dollar burger special they have .
i fully agree with amanda b. on this one .
overall , mediocre at best .
this to me is just rude and completely unprofessional .
he didnt even offer an apology , he just turned around and walked away .
i think thats about it for me and king gyro .
i dont think you should treat your customers that way .
stay away , theres many more places that appreciate there customers .
do not go here , they are unprofessional and rude .
this to me is not the way to run a business .
damn rude if you ask me .
this place and i will not recommend it to anyone .
makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home _num_ minutes early .
he told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed .
this place has the worst greek food i 've ever tasted .
on the positive side , the lettuce was green and was as expected .
seriously , the only thing they got right was the lettuce .
do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food .
it costs them more for frys then it does for lettuce and tomato .
every other gyros place i 've been to will substitute .
not impressed .
we ordered our food and sat down .
that 's the main reason i did n't give them _num_ star .
the tzatziki sauce did n't taste right .
i found it greasy and bland .
they were soggy , so i did n't eat any of them .
overnight i see that the price has gone up a dollar .
as far as the food goes , i think the gyros are pretty decent .
too much spanish here .
employees are loud and obnoxious .
this was the worst del taco ever !
the chips in the nachos were totally stale .
the fries were cold and the service was very mediocre !
being from out of town and getting such poor food was so disappointing !
bad bad bad customer service .
what horrible people .
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
when i pulled up i gave her my debit card .
the head clerk asked me not to talk this way to the clerk .
i 've been to drive thru windows that play games with charges before .
but , no more .
we could not use our only sink for over a day .
we left our phone number for nathan , the manager , to call us .
terrible beds , cheap fabrics , made for a difficult .
possible bed bugs , i woke with numerous bites on me .
but , as for security , it was a bit sketchy .
guy at the counter was nice , only plus .
the room was terrible - filthy .
this place is cheap and it 's obvious why when you get there .
burn marks in the comforter .
filthy windows , and various other strange smells i could n't recognize .
who is giving this place more than _num_ star ?
i was an awful stay here .
low water pressure from the shower .
bed springs were broken on the bed .
i would not bring a car rental here .
the only good thing was the bed !
when we told her we had a reservation she was not happy .
so we get to our room ... ... ew .
it is so disgusting in there .
they did n't even wipe down the sink ?
well as soon as we walked in , it was a joke !
i will not recommend this place because of the lack of care .
sorry red roof , just was n't a pleasant stay .
bowling is fun but they all are so dull and blah inside .
now there making no money from _num_ till midnight .
false advertising !
she could have done something but no .
horrible customer service !
but it was dead in there .
well , that is a sorry excuse .
no thanks !
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
i wear acrylic on my big toes and i needed a fill .
she was lost on what to do .
she was clueless on how to shape them .
then when it came time to paint them , it was a complete nightmare .
needless to say , i will never patron this location again .
some employees there have n't received their benefit packet and/or new hire paperwork !
even after the _num_ day hire .
this place is horrible .
they are bad news , especially their administration side .
and only then was i told where my check was .
nothing to write home about .
this place has the worst service of any bar i 've ever been in .
however , the staff has gone downhill .
nope and hell no thank you .
ps : bartender of _num_ years !
wo n't go back .
i was very disappointed with the quality & service .
i asked them what their delivery fee was , they said $ _num_ .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
they still did n't care .
it 's no wonder why people prefer to go to buffets .
, something happened , not good anymore .
i 'm trying to walk off on a bill for $ _num_ ?
talk about bad customer service .
another badly managed chinese restaurant that ca n't cook .
first off , i found them to be a tad expensive .
the rice was bland and the pork was an odd color .
the chicken fried rice was also bland .
there are no veggies mixed in nor any meat .
the egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce .
the taste did not disappoint in that area .
the best thing i ate was the fortune cookie ... .
terrible service .
i will not be ordering from this place again .
i literally live _num_ mins from this place .
very rude !
this is not how you treat customers .
but let this story begin at noon today .
first time ordering from here ... _num_ entrees and soup cost over $ _num_ !
and it was n't that great .
the orange chicken was very soggy and super sweet .
they make their own eggrolls , but they were n't that good .
the beef in the beef broccoli was average and the broccoli was mushy .
the sweet & sour chicken was average .
horrible delivery service .
really was some of the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
sorry will not be back .
not a single person came or left the _num_ minutes we were there .
i ordered a spicy chicken dish , asked no soy to be on it .
half the reason i wanted asian food was for the spice .
however the chicken was like gum .
ended up driving through taco bell on the way home , very irritated .
absolutely will not be back .
right now we 've got apps , soup and entrees - too fast !
had a touch of heat , but you also need the sour .
the highlight of our meal was the potstickers with dipping sauce .
these were pretty good , however i prefer them steamed to fried .
not so good .
i really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review .
however , the food just was n't that good .
the pork and chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless .
the vegetables were overcooked and soggy .
when going here for lunch my food was sub-par .
it tasted like leftover food and had very little flavor .
i did not come in expecting much and i left dissatisfied .
first time here ; tonight for dinner .
the service leaves little to be desired .
our server was n't pleasant at all .
before tonight 's meal , i would 've easily given _num_ stars .
however , our meal ( while delicious ) , gave me horrible food poisoning .
me and the boyfriend did not like the food as much .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
the pot stickers were hard like a rock .
the rice was cold and not fresh as it seems like .
nope , no customer service .
worst customer service ever .
not accommodating at all .
the manager has zero sense of urgency or compassion .
took my suv there to get the air fixed which stopped blowing .
disappointed ... .
it held a vacuum , there was no leak .
they lost me as a customer .
lots of bad reviews about the same stuff .
most every morning they mess up my coffee !
get a clue ?
ca n't beat the price though .
i had them fix it and they apologized with an apple pie .
no sausage .
no egg .
no cheese .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the service was pretty fast but the food was awful .
fucking slow , _num_ cars in the drive through and been here _num_ minutes .
fucking stupid .
clean , but super slow .
the cashiers are super slow at taking orders and getting food orders out .
this drive-thru is so slow !
i sat in line _num_ minutes for a hot coffee .
i do n't really care for avenue 's clothes .
i found a pair at _num_ % off immediately .
and he just hung out ... .
she seemed put out and came up and rang me out .
all in all ... just strange .
worst place ever !
worst place ever !
debit card , this place need to get with it .
it 's a sunday night it was n't even busy .
no silverware in the bag .
one star because there is no zero star ... .
i stopped in for chicken this week .
i can not say thanks for the experience , truly disappointed .
kfc used to be one of my favorite places .
in time their lousy customer service will catch up .
was told they did n't have potato wedges .
they let me substitute a side item for it which was ok .
does n't get my biscuit or my soda .
sounds like incompetent management and poorly trained staff .
no customer service ... and then nothing but disrespect .
i 've talked the manager before & they act like they do n't care .
it really is n't rocket science .
you even read back to me what i ordered then again when i pay .
i should 've known better .
they got it wrong again .
i 'm paying a lot of money for the wrong order .
frustrating .
i would give _num_ stars .
got the order completely wrong .
left stuff out of the bag that they charged me for .
more than pissed .
i had ordered _num_ family meals with _num_ extra biscuits .
after i paid they told me they did n't have enough biscuits .
they advised me another _num_ minutes .
this was a little frustrating but i let it go .
so after doing that , did she finally acknowledge me standing at the counter ?
shame on you , villa !
last time i visited the staff was horrible .
the chicken was frozen and nasty .
no eye contact , very short with me , just generally angry .
i 'm _num_ .
tl ; dr : foods good , depressing environment .
like they are doing you a favor by being open .
when we walked in we were ignored for a good few minutes .
customer service in this day and age is truly a lost art .
unfortunately the people running villa deli lost it a long time ago .
tons of sandwich places around with better attitudes , and better food .
now they purchase them and they are like day old chewy hamburger buns .
chewy , tasteless pieces of bread .
they no longer bake their own bread .
the new owner has an attitude problem .
from what i witnessed , she would n't let her employees take orders .
rude staff .
i should have just left at that point .
small portion of meat and again rude and seemed irritated to be working .
tables were dirty and we were the only customers in the restaurant .
wo n't be back .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
business _num_ class might help his lady .
so disappointing .
the bread was mediocre .
very skimpy with lettuce , tomatoes , peppers , etc .
unfortunately , we also ordered cannoli .
it was runny , thin , flat and no chocolate chips or anything .
no powdered sugar .
that garbage at least has better consistency and taste .
i 'm just angry that i threw away almost $ _num_ .
no attempt was made to remove it .
please do n't waste your money !
it is not clean and i even pointed out a cockroach out to them .
very disgusting !
not very professional and merely sub par .
if i could i 'd give this zero stars .
worst _num_ 1/2 hrs .
everytime i go in there ... there 's only one person .
a haircut , manicure , facial and a follow up haircut .
my facial was like _num_ minutes long and i could n't even relax .
i am the owner of devine 's .
you can not respond and when you contact yelp , you get no answer .
so therefore , i am assuming that these people do not exist .
well , the groupon was for $ _num_ .
it cost me an extra $ _num_ for the gel french manicure .
also ... the normal price for a pedicure is $ _num_ .
this was in no way worth $ _num_ .
nothing special about it , no hot towels , hot stones , etc .
tastes like just bread .
was n't good at all .
i was craving the classic : plain bagel toasted with plain cream cheese .
the bagel itself was the big disappointment .
as one reviewer pointed out , it tasted like bread .
but a big disappointment with the bagels .
for now , there 's nothing to bring me back .
bad business .
not the best service i 've ever had .
not sanitary .
i 've worked in food business and that 's not acceptable .
will not be returning .
the fried clams were horrible .
the only plus was that they were not strips .
the batter is terrible as well .
can i give zero stars ?
everything just lacked flavor .
heck , i 'd even take some salt .
but no .
the breading on the clams was a little better , but still flavorless .
if i could give negative stars i would .
when i was _num_ .
i have to agree with everything chad f said .
the clams were tender but the tartar sauce was horrible .
the food was overpriced for the quality and terrible .
save yourself a trip , do n't go here .
their batter is not very good at all .
not good eats .
old , dusty , very tired decor .
time to pick this mess up and take it into _num_ .
the chowder was so-so .
however for the portion you get it in pretty expensive .
i have had better chowder at a lower price .
i would n't recommend women walk across the parking lot alone .
i looked for the crab , there was none .
why do the seem to disappoint once you 've raved about them ?
went on saturday for lunch and the dining area was not to busy .
my rating is based off of food quality .
we had dinner here tonight and it was just average .
i do not like that so did not get any .
my friend said it was not good at all .
our server was very nice but she got basic things wrong .
a diet coke turned into an ice tea and she figured the bill wrong .
a big , '' no , no '' for me .
so needless to say , avoid this place at all cost .
horrible experience !
she came over and was rude from the start .
the entire experience in dealing with her was horrible .
she did n't even clear our plates at the end of our meal .
she then told me that not all the candies was for me to take .
the supervisor did n't even seemed shocked that i was complaining .
i did n't want to know about her personal life or excuses .
don then asked me what i want done !
i left the conversation even more frustrated and disappointed .
they probably have good fried food but anything else is just not good .
horrible is being nice .
they were bitter , strong and tasted old .
they were also soggy and seemed under cooked .
it looked and tasted like it came from a box .
again tasting strong and very fishy , obviously not fresh and home made .
needless to say , it just sat there .
what i remembered was nothing like that .
it was awful .
the fries were the only thing i ate .
not much changed inside in _num_ years except for the food .
we probably will never come back because of the disappointment of this experience .
_num_ customers and one waitress ?
then it grew to _num_ customers and one waitress .
we ordered chowder and fried cod , with fries and coleslaw .
the chowder was n't very tasteful it very bland .
so sad !
am here for only a few days soooo sad .
will not go back .
wrong !
do not go through the drive through .
went there last saturday and waited _num_ minutes in line at the drive through .
never any apologies and what 's worst no one seemed to care .
giving this location _num_ star only because yelp required it to post my review .
they always apologize about the wait and yet do nothing to fix it .
so frustrating !
shift manager was an asshole .
i tried paying with my debit card and unfortunately it was declined .
the worst burger king i ever been to !
its empty for a reason and the employees seem careless .
service is slow even if your the only customer .
of all people the owner is who treated us poorly .
instead he takes the opportunity to practice his sit-down comedy act i guess .
a business that treats a potential customer like that wo n't get my business .
i did get my one concern covered , but barely got examined .
i 'll probably just switch doctors all together .
avoid this clinic at all costs !
at _num_ am i was still waiting to be seen .
she was however very understanding and caring .
when we arrived , there were _num_ other people in the entire place .
especially when there are only _num_ people in the whole restaurant .
ca n't this conversation wait until you are off work ?
this was highly unprofessional ... and annoying .
not even worth the convenience .
employees are always rude too .
they 're always loose and stuff falls out .
i ordered one thing today around _num_ with no line in the drive through .
i ordered a bean burrito no cheese .
i guess not a good day to visit this location .
i 'll be buying else where from now on .
but not jerry .
i mean , i 've never done this before .
what he should have asked me was what is the painting company 's name .
by this time i was annoyed with jerry and his surly attitude .
he 's an old guy who probably does n't want to be working .
do yourself a favor ... avoid jerry .
very disappointing !
i am not happy leaving this place !
it 's more like `` the bad egg '' !
more like the bad egg ! ''
the place looks like it might have been remodeled ( ? )
the absolute worst denny 's ever .
only half of the order was served .
there was no compensation for the late service or missing orders .
the cooks sucked .
the soups were horrible and smelled bad .
no no no .
this location is consistently poor with their service .
my boyfriend and i visited late one night after i got off work .
it was almost empty , maybe _num_ people total .
our waiter rarely checked on us .
i avoid this place whenever possible .
service is slow , even past 10pm .
but this is unacceptable .
i will not be going back to this location .
when the manager arrived , she told me that she had removed my coffee .
horrible experience !
rude manager , confused server , cold food .
it was pretty much perfect , however , this one is not it .
yes i sent it back _num_ times !
however now i regret eating here seeing as the food and service were awful .
what kind of breakfast place does n't have cream cheese ?
so i asked for a bit more butter , but i never got it .
honestly if i could , i would give this location _num_ stars .
ever since they remodeled and got new management the service is terrible .
very unprofessional , but whatever .
she continued to shout and is just flat out rude .
i work in customer service and i know how people should be treated .
i wish you did n't even have to leave a star .
the hostess said wait while i check the tables and never came back .
meh , we were n't that impressed with our latest visit to top shelf .
the side of guac we got was also kinda crappy .
crappy food terrible service !
the food sucked and the waiter was rude !
expensive food thats not worth it !
tiffany never brought my water .
zero stars .
do not stop there , do not order .
do not waste your time or money .
filthy dirty carpet ( what is the kitchen like ? )
the food is disgusting .
disgusting place .
the service was awful for lunch .
the food was good but not worth the _num_ hour lack of service .
and the original waitress did n't even come out to our table to apologize !
when the bill came , we gave the waitress our coupon .
not authentic at all .
hands down the worst service i 've ever had today !
our waitress should know that my husband nor i ordered anything alcoholic !
this is absurd !
save yourself some grief and skip this place !
bad food ... bad customer service .
the food is average at best , as is the service .
ugh .
$ _num_ for one small burro ?
service was great , beer was cold .
i 'd rather eat elsewhere .
wo n't be back .
go there every week , for the last couple months .
service just gets worst and worst .
we sat down with my boyfriends parents , who arrived before us .
by now we have n't even gone in for 2-3 weeks now .
go there every week , for the last couple months .
service just gets worst and worst .
we sat down with my boyfriends parents , who arrived before us .
by now we have n't even gone in for 2-3 weeks now .
$ _num_ for a burrito the size of a mini taco .
very very disappointing .
it was a little after _num_ p.m. and a ton of open tables .
i asked if there was a waiting list , and the hostess said yes .
after a few minutes , the first group of _num_ was seated .
someone took the drink order of the birthday group , but not us .
i could not stand it anymore .
i gave my $ _num_ coupon to the birthday group and we left .
we will not be back .
i do not honestly know why anyone eats at top shelf anymore .
two plates were brought for a total of _num_ .
the mini chimis were average at best .
honestly , i was just annoyed the service was bad and slow .
they obviously did n't know what was going on .
this was the worst service i have ever had anywhere .
when the food came one meal was not even there .
one meal was the wrong meal .
we spent over _num_ dollars .
the manager took _num_ minutes to figure out how to turn the sound down .
the bad thing is the management and owners do not care .
never even got a cocktail or anything !
calling gm on monday .
terrible for adults .
i did n't receive a call from anyone .
she was on the paperwork but had never been there before .
i was very disappointed after visiting this store .
no thank you .
their new location is more crowded , cramped and hot than the last one .
employees never greeted us or asked if they could help us find anything .
if zero stars had been an option i would have chose that .
scheduled appt for business to be sprayed .
horrible customer service .
would rather support them than buy a donut at safeway !
lady had no clue how to do math helping us .
i will never go back to this trash bucket .
do not , under any circumstances make this mistake .
it 's partially my own fault .
bagel = dry / flavorless .
oh alright , i 'm picky .
listen , if i 'm paying i can be picky .
i will not recommend this place or go back .
low and behold our card was charged by bosa .
so i call back and the lady was rude as heck .
rude customer service is never a good idea .
i have tried the apple fritters and they are not good .
it 's like just eating oil , they have zero flavor .
no offer to take my name or number .
every time i have found the food to be mediocre .
he gave me my ticket to go inside and pay .
the inside looked pretty clean but there were spots that were just completely ignored .
this place is terrible !
horrible customer service !
not to mention it was _num_ minutes before their posted closing time .
do n't give them your business , apparently they do n't need it .
the place is old , over priced , bad service .
there is a drive through that takes too long .
the parking is terrible .
i ca n't believe that anyone likes this place !
it 's so disgusting and greasy .
i ordered sausage and it was shredded and salty .
so gross .
worse than starbucks !
i have ordered pizza twice since my last post and have been disgusted .
omg do n't waste your time .
taste mediocre at best .
always trash hanging out of the garbage cans and the floor is dirty .
staff is friendly but just not a nice environment .
just waited _num_ min .
dirty , dirty , dirty .
none of the employees take pride of the property .
this is an embarrassment to our beautiful neighborhood .
worst service ever .
this place is inside of a gas station with very poor attitude .
this place is a rip off .
this place is obnoxious .
horrible hours .
bad customer service .
nope they just send everything back .
bad business .
my daughter ca n't go to school because her birthday is on october .
he jumped back like he never saw a dog bark before .
she does n't need a bath .
no compassion , no respect , no vet knowledge .
our dogs mean everything to us .
needless to say i was n't going to pay the higher price and walked .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
staff wo n't bother , either .
them only having one server for dinner on a weekend ... strike one !
terrible food ... strike two !
she stood there with an annoyed look and said `` well ?
she had to come get you _num_ times !
if you value your safety stay far away from this place !
this is not a safe place to bring your family .
but we walked out thinking , `` how can they be in business ? ''
server was friendly but wait time for food was an hour plus .
this place needs a bar rescue in the worst way .
we sat inside where there was only _num_ other table occupied .
then , we ordered our food and waited another _num_ minutes .
_num_ of the _num_ orders were delivered .
i ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich , which hardly had any cheese whatsoever .
the potato salad was so bland i ended up sending everything back .
waitresses do not know what is on the menu or what beers they have .
service is horrible .
only received _num_ wings .
she does n't give a shit .
my husband and i went for lunch on a saturday .
there was plenty of seating .
the slaw was terrible and was just plain cabbage .
it was fatty and just ok .
breakfast today was very disappointing .
we have requested this before and have been very pleased .
the waitress took them back and brought me some sliced tomato .
then to add insult to injury they charged me $ _num_ for the potatoes !
tried today and food hardly edible and cold .
wo n't ever eat there again unless they hire a decent cook .
omg and that is no exaggeration .
this has to be by far one of the worst walgreens ever !
i hate that this is the closest walgreens to me .
the walgreens i lived by before was so much better than this one .
the last time i was in here was for allergy medicine .
well if your merchandise if marked wrong you think you would fix it .
she literally just stared at me and said `` you pay now '' .
yea no thanks .
might i mention this woman is so slow .
needless to say i left pretty angry .
this layout is horribly inconvenient .
i 've never had experienced a walgreens like this .
i get bad days .
rude !
worst costumer service ever .
this woman is rude and lacks even the smallest bit of customer service .
she will not smile .
she will not say hi .
she wo n't say have a good day .
she does n't tell you your total .
she does not place them in the bag .
she literally threw my basket after she took it off the counter .
worst salon ever .
worst customer service .
worst dye job .
half of my head was over processed .
i will not be going back .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
so bad birthday and hair experience !
thus was overall a horrible experience .
i wish _num_ stars was an option .
the wings were slimy and disgusting .
maybe try putting cheese on the pizza .
seriously the sauce to cheese ratio is embarrassing .
this is pizza not lasagna .
it is like all the other busy restaurants in mesa , just average .
sadly this place did not really live up the the reviews .
unfortunately , when i spend $ _num_ on sandwiches i expect something worth that .
not much to right home about .
if you 're into that sort of thing , be my guest .
very sloppy .
they were too crunchy and hard .
tab for _num_ people ( one only had coffee ) was $ _num_ .
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
the three meals came with chocolate chip cookie , which was excellent .
wo n't come for breakfast again but might try the bakery .
the coffee , thankfully , was hot enough to melt it down the throat .
rude service .
stale treats .
not going back .
they have since made restaurant smaller which ruined the appeal of eating there .
the staff is super unfriendly unless they know you .
it also was old and crusty hard .
the last french dip i got was pathetic with small portion of beef .
this place is going on old reputation only and not improving .
been here a few times and unfortunately not impressed .
bottom line , they are okay but not great and not worth the price .
there was way too much icing to roll ratio .
well , i ca n't even find the words to express my disappointment .
no trays of cinnamon rolls to be found .
it certainly is not the place featured on the show !
not one in the place !
it did n't even smell good like a bakery should .
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
prior to that it was overpriced and underwhelming .
avoid !
really i would think yes monday your closed memorial day not saturday ?
lame anyways maybe next time .
food was so so nothing to rave about .
i ordered ordered a turkey sandwhich along with a gooey cake .
the cake was dry and tasted like a cookie .
i will not be coming back .
here 's a tip put someone at the drive through who speaks english !
the food was actually pretty crappy , although the fries were good .
i probably wo n't go there again .
i do n't know why i keep coming back to this place .
shame on the owner of this one .
not only rude but seriously , the slowest service ever !
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
the employees are always rude and could care less about your order .
the condition of the building and parking lot is horrible .
wish i could give no stars .
management is unprofessional , unsanitary , and rude .
disgusting .
poor management all around .
i was missing _num_ burgers & a fry .
slowest `` fast food '' place i 've ever been .
rude employees too .
this place is freakin terrible .
will not be back !
worst service i 've ever had and the food was just as bad .
just stopped by for dinner and am extremely annoyed .
there were probably 4-5 people working and not many customers at all .
one burger with onions pickles mayo mustard ketchup and cheese .
if it was just the ranch or the onions and mustard , no biggie .
super slow service for _num_ o'clock at night .
should 've went to mcdonald 's across the street .
the chicken sandwich was n't as big as i thought it would be .
only good thing is their fries .
not a great subway .
it almost never has another customer , for reasons that are pretty clear .
the first time i order here the employees were rude and impatient .
i remember i sat down to eat and my sandwich fell apart .
i wanted to tell them but figured they would be rude .
skip this establishment .
i do not recommend ever going to this subway .
he was n't a employee , just someone having lunch and hanging out .
so got ta buy each one separately .
the set up was very awkward , no ambience .
the waitress is no where to be found after she takes your order .
apparently , you really do get what you pay for .
my mother and i went to get our nails done for a night out .
but i will not go back .
i want gel nails , the whole nails made of gel .
not gel !
ok whatever !
bad service !
my nails look absolutely horrible .
i was so disappointed .
seriously she the worst so far in mesa in phoenix period !
terrible customer service .
no attempt to honor or keep my business , will never go there again .
rude !
it is really bad experience .
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
and because of that , she tried to cut corners to save time .
you just do n't find anything professional in this place .
i am so so so regret that i wasted my time and money .
i ate outside the box and did not get the wings !
unless you dipped in a sauce .
i also ordered the burger and it looked disgusting !
why was my burger grey ?
what the hell is that about ?
all and all it was a big disappointment , i wont be back .
wings and garbage pizza are solid but the italian sandwich is not good .
i have ordered it a few times and disappointed each time .
we walked in and were greeted right away .
however it took our waitress forever to come to actually take our order .
our drink order arrived wrong , but our waitress quickly fixed it .
there did n't seem to be anyone in charge .
i think they are very confused .
we ordered wings and they came back extremely dry .
wo n't be back .
terrible service .
we get our drinks then _num_ minutes later our appetizer .
so we pay the bill and leave .
this place is the same place it was and has been for 10+ years .
service is the worst - enough said .
said she would get our menus but did n't .
alexis was not seen very often behind the bar or on the floor .
my friend also go no trek to get water .
server attentiveness skills are at an all time low .
at the end of our meal , a manager died up .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
for this moment , she was terrible .
very unimpressive and unprofessional .
from _num_ to _num_ the place has gone to pot .
service is so bad everytime i go i kick myself for going .
they do n't even serve me the cook does .
my chicken strips were fried like catfish ?
so weird ?
it 's awful .
almost enough to ruin an entire plate .
she would not give me any information .
however , we no longer go to this location , and for good reason .
nothing is even close to as good as it once was .
i would even day it 's borderline bad .
every recipe has changed from wonderful to pathetic .
do not lease from here .
sent me to collections before even coming to me about the issue .
i sent multiple emails and never heard back from management after i moved out .
if i could do negative stars i would .
first off , their maintenance is horrible .
i have asked them to fix our air conditioning _num_ times now .
so it is more of a false sense of security than anything .
and they do n't really care .
not at this place .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
i lived in this complex for two years with little to no issue .
if i where him i would learn how to deal with customers .
does one have to give _num_ star ?
avoid it if you can .
worst management & staff imaginable and all follows from that .
what kind of mcdonalds does n't have that .
i would give then zero stars if i could !
worst mcdonalds ever , horrible service .
dirty and rude employees .
do not recommend !
worst mcdonald 's ever .
exactly , they are n't built in to all the stores .
it was too late to go back return as we were on a schedule .
so we just left it .
came home to find the sundae nearly melted and there was n't enough fudge .
i ordered _num_ sandwiches off the dollar meal for my family .
i thought the order was okay .
so we drove off .
worst customer service in the pharmacy department ever .
rude and incompetent people work here .
wo n't be shopping here in the future ; though i live nearby .
disgusting and disappointing , will definitely go elsewhere .
very unpleasant experience .
the utensils used to prepare the food for lying on a dirty table .
tried a chile verde breakfast burrito with potatoes and scrambled eggs and refried beans .
i just went here with my daughter .
i could n't believe it .
i kid you not , peas , and lots of them .
i hate peas , hate them .
and it was very hot , obviously had been heated up in a microwave .
all in all , a horrible experience .
i would have preferred that , any day of the week .
you get better quality from a traveling circus .
we recently took my _num_ yr old niece .
they are all very disappointing , and , well , lame .
so says my _num_ yr old and _num_ yr old .
save your money and do n't bother coming here .
i will not be back ... .
the staff is horrible i will never go there again .
and the prices should n't be what they are for that place at all .
this poor amusement park needs help !
staff looks miserable and is not friendly .
we walked the entire amusement park in two minutes .
$ _num_ to use the splash park ?
i thought that was ridiculous , since its free in my town .
we ended up not buying any tickets to ride the rides .
in conclusion , this place is overpriced with limited options .
this place is horrible .
literally horrible .
the splash pad is a joke .
not at all what we expected !
do not waste your time and money !
it 's was _num_ outside so you can imagine .
i was not at all impressed .
the signage was poor .
waste of money and time .
this place serves no real educational purpose .
the place was boring and runs well with the rest of az .
not for adults .
so rude !
thanks , but i could 've done that myself .
theater is small , but clean , which is why they get _num_ stars .
i find it tacky and greedy .
i handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait .
i 'm so disappointed in this place .
they should be more worried about their reputation .
an overall attitude adjustment would make a world of difference .
i was so disappointed in this potential venue for my wedding .
the fountain was badly stained , the bench in front of it as well .
there is nothing good about this venue .
michelle refused to refund any portion of the $ _num_ paid to the venue .
not taking it seriously ?
the owner is greedy and lacks any sense of compassion .
this venue is anything but helpful or positive .
i would stay far away from this venue .
this was the worst experience i have ever had .
i would give it a zero if possible .
very poor service and getting worse .
i chose courtyard towers for my mother after an extensive search .
i have too many stories of poor service to even list here .
had a problem and for _num_ $ i was told ac was working .
_num_ minutes after they left stopped working .
they were trying to help go thru a home warranty company but that failed .
easily the worst sonic i 've been to .
i will not return to this sonic .
cold , slow , tasteless food .
worst sonic i 've been to .
_num_ minutes in a drive thru line is not quality service .
the woman taking my order was rude and not very helpful .
the management is a joke and she is very rude .
plus , she treated my allergies like nothing .
nothing but issues and my door is n't even installed yet !
so we scheduled dec _num_ for the installation .
since this was their mistake i requested they install my opener for free .
are you kidding me ?
no return calls no contact from them at all .
wish i could do _num_ stars .
an appointment was made for today between _num_ and 3pm .
he is not very customer friendly at all !
frankly , i was not impressed .
bread / toast was below par and over buttered .
after the last time , though , never again .
there is no excuse for rudeness to paying customers .
there were _num_ of us in total .
before you try it !
rude service never returning .
we sat on the patio , it was so dirty !
i would not even send my worse enemy to this dump !
would have rated lower if i could .
horrible service over _num_ minutes to get our food once we were seated .
needless to say neither of us finished our meals .
i live _num_ minutes away and i will not be back .
even on the way out the host did n't even say anything .
if i were you there are much better places to go that are close .
worst breakfast i 've ever had .
the quality of food is not the issue .
i wo n't waste my time trying again .
the pancakes were terrible as far as i am concerned .
the biscuits and gravy were just okay .
the bacon was not a high quality product .
overall not impressed .
poor customer service and very unprofessional staff !
one was breakfast which was served until _num_ am .
we were told _num_ am is when it was finished so very confused .
then i asked for the managers name and she would not give it .
pat was so rude !
that was ridiculous !
i was wrong at checkout i got an extra bill of almost _num_ dollars !
i was so livid i was crying !
the manager was so extremely rude !
the worst hotel experience i 've ever had in my entire life .
do not stay at this hotel .
i genuinely do n't want anyone to have to go through what i did .
of the $ _num_ deposit i put down i got back $ _num_ !
which is really just an insult .
they painted every wall in the place .
why did they spend half of my deposit to paint the walls ?
just office staff is extremely rude .
do n't get me wrong i like living here .
the worst mistake .
the office manager is incredibly rude .
these people know nothing about customer service .
this place and hertz in general lost a loyal customer .
whatever you do , do not go to this hertz .
turns out my rental was only $ _num_ for the entire week !
either way you will be in a worse situation .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
but if you have plenty of time to waste , definitely go there .
i had to wait for _num_ minutes with no apology or explanation .
so weird , and so over it .
see someone that actually cares .
his bedside manner is not about manners at all .
who the hell does this guy think he is ?
worst red chili mix burro , ever !
i will never return .
the food was not bad but the restaurant was just weird .
it was chips with fake cheese sauce .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito , it was just okay .
i wo n't go back .
salty , nasty , yuck .
i do n't understand why everyone likes this place so much .
i got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito .
my burrito was n't terrible but it was n't good .
it looked disgusting !
the salsa tasted terrible !
i would n't go back .
went here with a groupon because i wanted to try somewhere new in town !
not the best mexican i 've had , but it was n't bad either .
the rice was meh and the chicken tacos were okay .
not a big fan of the atmosphere , though .
that was enough for me to cancel my order and never return .
but the last time i was in and received the worst customer service .
the people that work there are rude and do not put the customer first .
he could have cared less !
she sounded like she could care less also .
she did n't care .
she refused to give it to me .
she did n't care , did n't apologize , just had a snotty attitude .
after all this my order was not even correct as i ordered it .
it was terrible .
it looked like the food was n't prepared correctly .
the soft tacos were soggy with grease .
the `` steak '' on the nachos looked like beans .
why not a `` zero star '' rating .
how can these rude and arrogant people stay in business ?
f this place !
do n't give these pieces of trash your business anymore .
if you forgot my food i 'd probably call and be mad too .
this place is not authentic plus it 's dirty looking all around .
i 'm sitting here still waiting on my burrito after _num_ minutes .
eggs potatoes and cheese .
no one really seems to know what 's going on .
the bathroom smells horrible .
so i asked for a chicken burrito with salsa like last time .
this burrito was so spicy i could not finish it .
that burrito burned all the way down .
i ate ghost chili peppers and it did not hurt this bad .
she had no idea why it had n't been delivered .
the people here are just bad .
i honestly have no idea why they even bother with delivery .
read the reviews , we are n't all lying .
the service is really that bad .
food is just ok not real mexican flavor as they advertise .
no flavor , less than ordinary , will never eat their food again .
if i could rate negative stars , i would !
ordered no meat , all vegetable burrito and got served extra bacon burrito .
be true to your posted hours so you do n't waste people time .
i used to go here all the time .
good quick simple and cheap mexican food .
then i saw their health inspection report online .
if they thought about their customers they would be more diligent about sanitation .
she refuses to reverse this charge .
the older gentleman who answered the phone said mike was out on the field .
that was my point and wanted to see if he could 've missed something .
but now they get very defensive and say he did n't miss anything .
yes he did take it apart to tell me there was a part missing .
this physician was highly recommended to me by more than one person .
the scheduling line is lacking .
the hold time each attempt was over _num_ minutes .
i just was n't that impressed .
went for lunch on sunday .
the service was really bad .
we were ignored for about _num_ minutes after coming in and sitting down .
the menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls .
the only vegetarian option was green curry so i ordered that .
the egg roll also had meat so i could n't try that .
my girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed .
the fried pieces of wonton were the most popular part of the meal .
i wo n't be back .
it was nasty .
too bad the taste was n't .
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
i did n't touch it .
my wife had the lemon chicken which was pretty good , but not great .
if i could give it zero stars i would !
this is n't the friendliest place in town .
i felt very uncomfortable the second i walked in there .
go try a different hole in the wall .
i do n't know how they have a lot of good reviews .
the food comes out quick , taste bland .
bad location .
i gave this place another shot and ordered crispy pork with chinese broccoli .
what the hell !
the pork was not crispy at all !
fooled me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me !
reality the food is alright , however very bland .
very disappointing .
no one was in the place when we came in .
we all ordered the chicken pad thai which was boring and bland .
no spice at all .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i ordered take out -- yellow curry and lemon chicken .
lemon chicken -- smelled burnt when i got home , looked burnt as well .
really wo n't be going back , extremely disappointed .
panang curry was the most perfect level of spice but only consisted of chicken .
no other vegetables , which i found odd .
i dunno what the hype is .
this place is okay ... not my top choice for thai .
i ordered the pad thai and i was unsatisfied with the meal .
i wo n't be visiting this place again .
the food had large portions for the price but just okay taste quality .
i was a little disappointed !
the new management team is horrible !
my problem is primarily the staff .
to hell with this place .
the employee , however , started suggesting i rent or buy the student model .
this makes it a _num_ star instead of _num_ .
not a good practice .
notes : they just do n't provide good customer service .
would not recommend this salon .
we walked in with no appt .
for $ _num_ mani/pedi i would definitely suggest you go somewhere else .
this was such an awful experience .
i have n't gone to get my nails done in probably _num_ years .
the paint was n't even and did n't coat the whole nail .
they were friendly , so that was a plus .
i always preferred pizza hut over any other franchise pizza place .
no apology , no have a good day , nothing .
this is hands down the worst company i have ever dealt with .
highly advised to stay away from here no matter what !
i 'm still waiting for pete the manger to call me back .
they clearly get an f for customer service .
i had a horrible experience with this company .
it looked awful .
i told them it was unacceptable .
no , i said , i want the chair done correctly .
finally , i went in and said just give me the chair .
i was n't even sure it was about me .
not sure why they are even in business .
the worst company ever !
dropped off _num_ chairs and gave them specific instructions .
they were terrible !
all the while serving _num_ customers ( including me ) the whole time .
worst service ever !
just ridiculous !
do not eat here !
maybe we just did n't luck out , but our tour guide was horrible .
the reviews for this year are not good .
even though we had reservations , it did n't do us any good .
it 's very convenient to my home , but not at that cost .
( takes me back to the late _num_ 's ) .
i have curly hair and once the bangs dry they stick straight out .
( takes me back to the late _num_ 's ) .
i have curly hair and once the bangs dry they stick straight out .
i did not have a good experience at this salon .
unhappy customer .
so i believe he chose the wrong profession .
i went to get extensions done by a stylist named joe .
i did n't want to write if it was something i had done wrong .
terrible , absolutely terrible ownership ; the lady has no regard for her customers .
on top of that when they did locate my jewelry it was damaged .
_num_ diamonds were missing from my band .
the only remedy is that they replaced the missing diamonds free of charge .
my husband got my original engagement ring at this kay jewelers .
in our case , that would be $ _num_ .
sorry but not many people have that kind of money just laying around .
before this incident , i was a frequent shopper at kay .
because of this , we will not shop at kay jewelers anymore .
their policies are awful .
went into this location to drop it off .
a salesperson by the name of tim was at the counter .
there is nothing special about them .
there are only _num_ locations in the valley so hope you live close .
terrible .
oh , and they have the oldest and worst website i 've ever seen .
i hate this credit union .
they were n't our fault , they were your fault . ''
after i realized she was serious , i was irritated .
but we did n't run the card , you did . ''
again , so rude and condescending .
it was really awkward .
the worst credit union on planet earth !
i called them three times and they said they never received the check .
i had to miss work time to call and talk to them .
one rep told me i needed to visit a branch to figure it out .
i 've never been late ever until i lost my job .
i received no response from barb to my email of concerns .
this was just _num_ of the items on my list .
is she not wanting to deal with me ?
in the beginning , i will admit that i was satisfied .
they made me believe all was in good standing .
if i could have given no starts i would .
stating it needed additional cleaning for one .
ah no i do n't think so .
since there is no option for zero stars then i 'll choose just _num_ .
we picked up our keys after dropping off all of our move in money .
i emailed over copies of the receipts for the carpet cleaning .
their receptionist was rude .
the wright house has soooo much potential , but they fail big time .
not cool .
not cool .
the reception hall and bridal suite on the other hand is a joke .
its a shame .
after being completely blown off for weeks , i give up .
we 'll find someone else to work with and give our money too .
it had big potential but working together wound up being extremely disappointing .
would n't recommend .
save yourself the trouble and use someone else .
and these idiots put my truck through the was with the back window down .
my custom sub box .
stay far away from this place .
horrible experience !
i wish i would have read the yelp reviews before taking my truck there .
my cab was n't even wiped down .
this truely was one of the worst car washes i paid for .
so i paid a whole other person to fix my ac .
so my advice , do not go here .
would not call other pharmacy nor my vet to do her `` research '' .
said it was running fine .
got it towed to another garage , which a friend recommended .
it took _num_ minutes to install the new one .
with tip , came to $ _num_ .
this was just a short , skinny section of over-cooked flank steak .
hard to cut with a sharp knife and hard to chew up .
wo n't be going back .
also , the rice was bland ... .
i probably would n't come back here .
the burrito alone was over priced and it was quite small .
the menudo was bland and the services was awful .
i 've had better menudo at filibertos and i 'm mexican !
you 're better off going to ranch market in gilbert .
we spent six years in southern cali , and about two years in arizona .
there were _num_ adults in our party , everyone got something different .
i was not impressed by any of it .
an hour and a half to serve four people mediocre food ?
the chimis were less than good , with absolutely no seasonings for the meat .
the food was mediocre ( if not lacking ) and the service was awful .
only a few chips and out of the bottle salsa for starters ?
no thanks .
honestly , the only thing worth the money is the menudo .
i wo n't be going back here again .
then , took another _num_ minutes to get chips , salsa and a drink .
eggs were undercooked and the sauce was thin and tasteless .
washer down , i also ordered a beer with tomato juice .
overall just a bad experience .
we sat down patiently for _num_ minutes without service .
sadly we wasted our time and left .
no big deal i thought .
so we get a table cleaned off like i said .
to me that 's not a good sign .
so about _num_ minutes have passed and she takes our order .
we also got a plain quesadilla for our daughter .
what about 5-10 minutes has passed we still have n't gotten our drinks .
i cut my chimichanga in half and take a bite of my food .
and was very disappointed .
a frozen burrito probably would have been better than the food we had .
not too happy with our experience today .
well sunday was even worse .
that fell very flat too today unfortunately .
our waitress was horrible .
first time & will be our last time .
initially , i was impressed .
however , i was sorely disappointed .
i guess they have no requirements .
it totally lacked in antique merchandise and that was what i was there for .
much of the junk i saw was in very , very poor condition .
some of the employees at this mcdonald 's are very rude .
the worst service ever .
i would not recommend them to anyone .
this place is horrible !
the manager threatened to cancel my order and hang up on me .
besides all this their prices are n't the best around .
i do n't even want to give them one star .
customer service is poor at best .
_num_ star auto gets a negative _num_ stars !
seriously , stay clear of this lot ... he & it are bad news !
avoid this foul , horrible place !
instead i say not to waste your time .
we sat down at one of _num_ total tables and waited for a bartender .
i was n't planning on coming in there just to eat .
nice selection ... horrible service .
asked to use bathroom , guy just said no .
however , on a recent visit i was a little disappointed .
how disgusting .
also , the individual pricing convention is lame .
waited ... pull up again nothing !
lots too choose from but piss poor service !
had their wings and they sucked .
and if you want them grilled its another buck .
( there goes their tip ) .
not alot of people there either ... for a friday night .
waitress never smiled .
dont like your job , dont work there !
thats what really turned me off .
negative vibe right from the get go .
we like that it is a small dive bar and located near out house .
however there have been many disappointing visits .
the wait staff is not friendly or inviting .
one blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude .
she seemed irritated and threw the three menus on our table .
we have given this place many chances and every time we are disappointing .
skip it and try another bar .
i will not be coming back here .
overall , not very impressed .
zero complaints with his work .
cranky old man who has been in the business too long .
i would not recommend going to this man .
i am disgusted with these guys .
then i pick up my car and he charges me $ _num_ .
he will never get another dime out of me.
this hotel is gross .
i was very angry that i had to sleep in this bed .
i could n't wait to check out of this hotel .
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
i ate it upset but so hungry after picking off the dreadful items .
you wo n't regret it .
not impressed .
my mother ordered a hot dog and it was microwaved .
dr. wright seems friendly to patients however he treats his staff completely different .
i was a former staff member and he rarely would ever say hi .
what doctor walks past his staff daily and does n't even say hi ?
dr wright has actually cost me money now and i 'm not happy !
i will make sure no one i know would go to them !
wo n't be going back there .
i do not know what happened to this place .
i used to live in mesa back in _num_ .
i would come get my hawaiian shaved ice from here all of the time .
the young girl behind the counter never looked me in the eye .
she never said hello .
if you 're going to own a business learn how to treat customers idiot !
the guys were friendly , and got me booked in quickly .
loose plastic tab on my grille .
fixed with one _num_ cent screw .
no greeting .
he walked away from me and assisted them instead !
are you kidding me ?
the only reason i gave it two stars is because the ring is nice .
the lack of service deserves zero stars .
worst customer service on the planet !
i refuse to buy from this store i 'm going to order online instead !
this location has the worst customer service and selection .
have been buying accessories and batteries for years .
he does n't carry any sport bike parts .
however , he stated he would call me back after asking someone else .
plus , the delivery men were surprisingly rude .
this place is awful !
he told me no problem .
at this point , it 's _num_ pm and they close on _num_ pm .
i just do n't trust them anymore .
that does n't match what jerry told us .
all in all , very unprofessional .
i will never do business with jerry or this company again .
do you know why there are zero stars checked ?
two times i tried to go her , and two times i was denied .
but this weekend , low and behold ... .
it was not open and there was no sign explaining why .
this is no way to run a business .
very sad to learn that as i loved the place .
i should n't have to track you down to find this out .
shocked , i replied `` because i wan na take a class . ''
so one day , i convinced her to stop in and try it .
a very bad one .
the place is indeed charming , but ultimately not worth it .
i guess this business does n't want my business .
i wanted this place for my wedding more than anything .
it 's _num_ _num_ and you are standing doing nothing !
why are you being so rude ?
rude , inconsiderate owners who have no business dealing with the public .
today was my first time here and unfortunately had a very bad experience .
it seems the request for extra room was against the rules here .
nope , just sorry owner and an even worse human being .
we will not be coming back .
the owner was atrocious .
my mom explained , once again , they were not a party .
she had to get a to go box because the service was so slow .
could n't even do her own job .
they really need to work on their hospitality skills .
almost everything was very poor .
they 're excuse was a wedding the night before .
buy more blueberries or make less .
simple yet so difficult for this coffee house .
rude , rude , rude , how does this place stay in business .
soo rude !
at _num_ am , the place had no other customers .
of the _num_ of us , _num_ bought items .
after the staff member left , i went to the counter .
none of us used the bathroom .
i just had a very bad feeling about this place .
however , the owners ( the older woman especially ) were incredibly rude .
they overcharged me and my tattoo was gone one week after getting it done .
do not get your tattoos done here if you know what good tattoos are .
went here for history and was disappointed .
jessica needs a better bedside manner .
so one saturday night we decide to hit it up .
the karaoke host talked way too much in the _num_ minute we were there .
all this was our cue to leave .
there were cockroaches crawling on the bar top .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
bad management .
_num_ + years and will never go back .
we were having blast and so were most of the other patrons .
also , why is the `` bouncer '' inside watching karaoke ?
that `` bouncer '' is the real racist .
that place is disgusting anyways .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
burger , fries , and a beer for $ _num_ every tuesday .
asked for grilled onions and mushrooms on my burger .
waitress discounted are bill _num_ % for the inconvenience .
grill was off .
service is soooo slow !
came here on two occasions , a friday night and again monday .
i ordered the deep fried mushrooms and fish tacos .
i hate this .
i doubt if i 'll be back .
there are lots of tvs and your typical dive bar patrons .
and finally came back to tell me they were out of tuna .
she threw my coupon back at me and asked me to leave .
they hardly had any merchandise as well .
the gentleman did have an attitude .
one gentleman purchased chips and a hotdog .
when i went to the restroom , i noticed that it was quite filthy .
this one , however , had seen better days i 'm sure .
it was appalling .
and this was extremely disappointing .
one gentleman purchased chips and a hotdog .

not at this location .
one gentleman purchased chips and a hotdog .
when i went to the restroom , i noticed that it was quite filthy .
this one , however , had seen better days i 'm sure .
it was appalling .
and this was extremely disappointing .
there was nothing convenient about it .
he said he would go and make us _num_ bags of ice .
the fries were unremarkable .
also , she sold me a sleeping bra that is awful .
two dentists since then have told me the quoted work is unnecessary .
i am still fighting the fees .
this place is a nightmare .
there were no x-rays taken .
so , you 're charging us for work that has n't been done ?
i would not recommend a business that is not honest .
i would not recommend them .
i spoke with seemed knowledgable , but they are extremely expensive .
i mean really , really , really expensive .
and then they billed me for it .
i wo n't return to them .
i was so furious i could n't even talk .
here my dog had been suffering for weeks for absolutely no reason .
and let them know that his other knee would be done elsewhere .
the surgeon said that he would tell the corporation that i was n't happy .
absolute worst experience .
she was in a lot of pain and had the hardest time breathing .
i was very disappointed with the clinic .
it was never cleaned up or treated in any way .
i have no idea how a person can be so cold .
he stayed at the other place for about a week .
to them , it just seemed like another transaction .
wrong !
over priced and the stores always seem to be dirty .
terrible terrible selection !
we were out having fun .
no extreme stuff .
the cashier was so rude .
she yelled at my daughter saying only _num_ coupons per household .
my daughter said we do n't live in the same household .
the cashier actually called my daughter a liar .
i will never walk into bashas again .
i 'm a charge nurse in an emergency room .
convenient most of time , but probably the worse grocery store ever to visit .
horrible .
very rude .
i have had such an awful experience with this place .
i can not make up phone records .
now me my husband and my son who is _num_ months are homeless .
this is such an awful thing to do to someone .
avoid this branch if possible .
customer service is a complete joke .
i arrived and no one was available to help me .
one clerk said someone would be with me shortly .
_num_ minutes passed and i was sitting on a chair still waiting .
her response was nothing .
she came across as snooty and rather condescending .
yes , do avoid this branch .
mary checked my ring in about _num_ seconds and than cleaned it .
i am very upset and disappointed .
they offered me a `` discounted '' diamond which i refused .
i wish i would have done more research .
i really wish i would have done the research prior to giving them business .
so i did just that for most all pieces .
then they are too big for the other fingers .
she is one reason why i no longer purchase items in this store .
she took all the warranty cards my rings and went up to the counter .
nothing was wrong with my rings and no stones were missing !
i would suggest you stay away and take your business elsewhere .
they just opened recently so they deserve a break .
the service part person was rude and had a bad attitude .
shame on you camping world !
absolutely the very worst repair experience ever .
to bad there is not a negative star scale .
it would be a negative _num_ .
that could have been a disaster !
guess what , no more coffee .
i called camping world mesa and got no satisfaction .
worst customer service ever .
if there was a negative star .
i will not renew my membership or recommend them ever .
i will never purchase anything from them ( not even toilet paper ) .
we have never had bad service from camping world .
if i could give less stars , i would .
run , dont walk to any other rv service center .
finally , after trying for _num_ days we got an appointment .
finally , after _num_ weeks i had to use the rv .
so here i sit waiting and writing the review .
this place is horrific !
worst customer service you 'll ever find in any industry , anywhere .
terrible .
the retail section is average , but the parts counter experience sucked !
after _num_ minutes of waiting i hung up .
ca n't wait to see him in person ... .
if possible i would stay far away from this place .
i will wait until i find another camping world or rv store .
we sold it for full list price , $ _num_ .
no customer service .
he never bothered to call me back .
what the heck is wrong with these people !
the sales team and sales manager really dont care .
$ _num_ after the $ _num_ coupon for merchandise .
they told me that there system could not do that .
finally got the $ _num_ back for the sheets .
and i got nothing for the $ _num_ coupon for the crappy service .
why would any body do business with this company .
horrible experience .
i would stay away from this place .
this place is a scam , everyone should be aware and avoid them .
tuesday rolls around and still no papers or update .
i called ryan on monday and tuesday and he was not available .
we wo n't even consider buying anything from this place !
do not in anyway believe this nonsense .
there is not such thing as elite service .
all told the coach would be in their hands for _num_ to _num_ weeks .
do not believe a word the salesman tell you regarding elite status .
it is not true .
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
no problem we will put a rush on it .
i do n't know how they stay in business .
do n't waste your time !
this review is for the service dept .
now i see why their average rating on google is _num_ star .
of course , the call did not come , and i continue to inquire .
get everything in writing and write down who takes your call .
the place for starters has no feeling of arrival .
the chips were the only good part of my meal .
not as many mushrooms though .
i really have tried to give this restaurant a shot .
literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate .
the place was totally empty at like 8pm on a friday night .
what horrible customer service !
the lighting was dim making it hard to read the menu .
food was decent , service was terrible .
terrible terrible food .
we all ordered different food and it was all disgusting .
if it were possible to give them zero stars , they 'd have it .
i would never go back .
very disappointed in this restaurant .
i was looking forward to a salad and she some mexican food .
when we walked in there was a wait in the dining room .
the other servers walked past us as if we were invisible .
for the owner to be so blatantly rude is inexcusable !
_num_ or _num_ people are at the bar .
our waiter was too busy covering what looked like the entire restaurant .
nothing special .
the biggest problem we had was service .
if the food had been outstanding , maybe i 'd try again .
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
i had the high desert pasta and there was barely anything in the bowl .
no lettuce , pico , nothing but chicken .
my stacked enchilada was essentially the same too , lots of chicken and cheese .
i have no idea why people are rating this place so highly !
very disappointing experience .
it looked like some kind of hollandaise sauce .
but unfortunately it was the same steak i just sent back .
my families dinners were also horrible .
when i left i looked and there were _num_ patio tables empty and clean .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
and it was n't an inexpensive visit either .
run , run as fast as you can away from this place .
booked appointment online waste of time .
called and made an appointment to get my tire repaired .
he then went into a hard sales pitch about getting a new tire .
waste of time , will never go back there or any discount tire again .
they did n't even bother to try filling my tire with air .
they found every reason in the book not to honor it .
this literally ruined my day .
annoying and i would not recommend .
mesa , az _num_ and they honored the warranty with no problems at all !
friendly staff but disappointing visit .
just to make money of my ass ... .
will probably never buy tires from discount tire again .
guess he did n't think i could come up with the paperwork .
fyi , free work is usually cheap work .
this message is to warning everybody who go here !
awful , awful , awful .
do n't repeat my mistake .
there are around five entrees , rice and noodles .
i was dragged here and was not interested ... .
nothing has been done to improve the look of the place .
this is quite frankly one of the most disgusting chinese buffets i have visited .
the food had nothing redeeming about it and was very cold .
it was also extremely limited on selection .
i would avoid it at all costs .
they do n't really have variety of selections to choose from .
their chow mein was super dry .
the place was too small and had too much flies in it .
none of their food was hot when ordered .
this place is just awful .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
was ill for a few hours .
if you 're looking for quality chinese food you are in the wrong place .
lovely staff and a one service .
limited variety but for $ _num_ it was fine .
this is not gourmet chinese food .
gourmet chinese food would be $ _num_ for one entree plus tax and tip .
wontons were not greasy .
did not like orange or lemon chicken because of the thick , thick crust .
this place was awful !
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
the orange chicken was more bread then chicken and let alone zero orange flavor !
the worst chinese buffet ever .
the buffet is about _num_ feet long .
no selection .
no deserts .
it was $ _num_ without a drink and it was worth about $ _num_ .
i should 've looked at the buffet before i paid .
big mistake .
so for that aspect its part my fault .
i do n't know how this place stays in business .
it was lunch and it was dead .
never got the craps afterwards but that was a surprise .
probably because i ate half my plate and left early .
do n't eat here .
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
minor detail but it could easily be fixed .
i asked if they had replaced the spare and he told me no .
it was one of the worst experiences i have ever had with a store .
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
but in the mean time , they would not give me my car .
i do n't want a hug .
_num_ . )
no salt , overcooked and stiff .
i could n't even eat them .
_num_ . )
lame .
_num_ . )
no malt vinegar .
i agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible .
it was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like .
dingy , dark , dirty , sticky -- that 's your table .
greasy , unappealing , low quality -- that 's your food .
the beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless .
were bothered by it and walked out .
it is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint .
nothing wowed me .
well , it 's not authentic mexican food , but authentic old fashioned tex-mex .
old lounge style atmosphere , kind of tired , but service was good .
there 's just too many other good choices out there .
girlfriend wanted mexican food and not just a regular run to taco bell .
service was fine but the decor seems or rather is very outdated .
just wo n't be mine .
disgusting .
gross .
the rice had dried out pieces from the microwave .
i was so mad that i paid for horrendous food .
i will not be going there ever again .
needless to say , we will never return to this place .
how it has been in business for over _num_ years is beyond me .
never in my life have i ever been treated so poorly at a restaurant .
no chicken fingers or chicken nuggets for the little ones .
my new rating is zero .
bad decision .
disgusting !
i just walked out .
the food was mediocre at best .
the beef and chicken tastes almost the same .
the salsa was not good .
not sure what , but it was missing something !
but that was probably the only plus !
a little pricy for just one and that had no beans or rice with .
i also failed to mention that they have no kids menus !
hell id even take taco bell over this highly priced , awful establishment !
large quantities , but too salty and the tamale was almost nothing but breading .
what little filling there was was significantly over the spiced .
beef enchilada was also extremely salty , cheese enchilada was very good .
i would like to have the drinks shortly after the chips and salsa .
he did n't take time to listen to what the patient wanted .
there is something seriously wrong with this man .
she was very through and listened well to his problem .
it 's too bad because i do believe that their doctors are great .
the lady on the phone was horrible .
this office is horrible !
service was painfully slow .
the food , normally good for baja , was lousy .
the service was painfully slow .
the salsas used to be so much better and more flavorful .
it 's bland , slightly dry and just not there anymore .
they absolutely can not go on like this .
i could n't finish it .
now the bad : my family is vegetarian with the exception of me .
i dont think its as good as everyone says it is .
i probably wont be back although not bad .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
i 'm done with rosa 's .
went there on thursday and ordered something i am very used to ordering .
bland and stale .
crappy ?
this place is below average .
this food is hot garbage wrapped in tortillas .
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .
i would not recommend them .
not impressed at all and a little disappointed .
but i have to say i 'm disappointed .
the chimi tasted almost burned .
$ _num_ for two adults and one kid .
the chimi was dry .
my food was b l a n d. atmosphere was quaint .
do n't feel the need to go back .
but i wo n't be coming back .
my friends and i stopped at rosa 's for lunch after golf .
however , i ordered my spinach enchiladas as it is usually good .
however this time it was not the same .
his attitude was `` your tough luck '' if you do n't like it .
he was rude and does not belong in the food service industry .
perhaps the management of this location need to be looked at by the owner .
suggested by someone we met and did not live up to the hype .
chicken was dry dry dry .
the corn tortillas were sooo dry and chewy .
beef was flavorless like it was n't seasoned .
such a disappointment .
i 'm really bummed to have a negative attitude about this place .
which made me sad to hear .
i wish i had better things to say but i 'm just really disappointed .
i took my _num_ cats here to have their nails trimmed .
i am assuming she was not handled carefully enough .
this was not like her .
jennifer was only concerned for herself and not my cat .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
try getting an oil change for less than $ _num_ .
sadly , it 's not possible to put zero stars .
this was absolutely the worst customer service experience i 've ever had .
i give the information to jeff and he took it but did nothing .
this place does n't even deserve a freakin star at all .
and freakin said hell no .
and would n't do anything about it .
and treat you like crap .
extremely slow and half ass pedicure .
not kid friendly .
as inexpensive as this place is i left feeling over charged and unsatisfied .
worst customer service ever .
i called , was put on hold and then hung up on .
unprofessional and poor quality .
rip off !
i 'm so disappointed with this company .
i have them _num_ home movies on march and called continuously .
they have n't responded to emails or notes left on their door from me .
bad experience .
terrible delays .
he was to make _num_ copies of each and i had paid $ _num_ .
he , too , was very annoyed .
i should have grabbed them then , but he had my $ _num_ .
i asked the police for help but that was a lost cause !
they are of no value to anyone else but are priceless to me .
i too have lost several hundred family slides due to this business closing .
the staff has always been pretty unhelpful and sometimes very pushy with sales .
the decor is bland and depressing and has n't changed in years .
long story short .
he 's rude and ca n't cut hair well at all .
a simple yes or no would have done .
downfall , prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location .
this grandma only offered me .
its not just about science here , its about taste .
unfortunately grandma did n't have that either .
i would not recommend grandma 's kitchen to people with young children .
it is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant .
i admit my son 's ages _num_ and _num_ were a little noisy .
but i did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite .
i 've visited several times for both breakfast and lunch .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
i wish them luck .
his omelet was so-so , and my oatmeal was watery and possibly instant .
the toast was good , but that 's not a shock .
the seating area is crowded with furniture that obviously does n't suit the space .
the worst part of the restaurant is the service .
on our second visit , we met grandma .
shame on you , grandma .
do n't waste the trip .
the decor was pretty solid and had a country feel .
there was no review of the specials or the daily quiche availability .
the sausage patties were pretty good but kinda thin .
moldy bread was served then replaced .
been coming here for years ... need that clean loving country grandma feel back .
food decent , atmosphere is nonexistent !
i went here with my father in law and my _num_ year old daughter .
the atmosphere was so-so , they should have had music on or something !
the waitress was n't mean or rude , just kinda surly .
some what cheap food .
grandma is rude .
negative _num_ stars for the poor garage staff .
did they fix the problem ?
( huh ? )
the night person was the complete opposite .
this is my second one star review on yelp and they deserve it .
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
very clean place but just no ambiance .
nothing special .
poor drinks .
the pool sticks were in terrible condition and were n't straight in the slightest .
on top of that , the service was terrible .
other than that , we did n't see her at all .
if that 's your thing , then go for it .
i ordered _num_ wings and _num_ breasts ( paying extra mind you ) .
a complete waste of money .
the service here is the worst .
i am extremely disappointed with this location .
the only good thing in our combo meals was the warm cookie .
otherwise , ick .
this location served uncooked chicken tenders .
so unacceptable .
completely disgusting !
served me raw chicken .
horrible just horrible never again .
this was _num_ years ago .
burn in hell .
this place is a total dump and ripoff .
if you are a disabled veteran do not even think about moving in there .
upstairs and within a few days my husband was bit by bed bugs .
which i really do n't care about .
its the health and safety of my daughter and husband i care about .
and the average age of people there when i visited was probably _num_ .
not something i 'd take junior to do .
nasty people .
look ... i 'm sorry ... but i just do n't get it .
would i want to repeat it again ?
the experience was super extremely terrible for me .
so gross .
this was seriously was a waste of money and scary experience for me .
i freakin almost died here .
is this place even legit cause you can only pay cash of $ _num_ ?
no taxes ?
does the state really even know about this place ?
i called the phone number and the bus driver answered the phone .
monday came and went with no phone call .
that 's how you get repeat and referral business .
salt river bus is not a reputable company .
the other _num_ should really just wear a normal suit .
but i wouldnt want to take my niece and nephew .
we did n't even get to go down the river .
waste of time , waste of a day , horrible customer service .
make no mistake , this is a booze cruise and is not family friendly .
who knows , it might have been .
the bottom is lined with cans .
no glass is allowed .
high prices and poor customer service .
completely disappointing disgusting experience .
cash only business , no mention of this on website .
do not recommend .
not my type of fun .
this would have been true customer service even in a hard situation .
it 's not pretty walking through the river without a shoe on .
probably from the 70s and obviously not maintained !
the tube they rent are a joke !
you will most likely sink if you lightly bump against a river rock .
it 's cluttered with beer cans and the smell of dead fish !
also bring a cell phone and most importantly , `` your own tube '' !
it sounded like fun but fell a little short of expectations .
they had lots of friendly staff on hand to check everyone in .
they should n't use precious ac space for storage !
on the tag , needless to say i was disappointed .
wo n't be returning .
when i am in the neighborhood i stop in and i am always disappointed .
i do n't know why i bother going here .
bad experience .
no way !
way back when , we looked into destination weddings with a aaa az branch .
a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired .
things went sour from there .
we hardly ever received return phone calls on time .
unfortunately , it was n't that easy .
we would 've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves .
i 've been a aaa customer for _num_ years in multiple states .
is n't this the job of a travel agent ?
our travel agent did not assist a single one in booking .
this was june 1st .
we were very disappointed .
he was rude and not explain well why he did not change .
i believe if he did nothing wrong , he can show me his id .
he was totally jerk .
i was not happy with their mobile battery service .
i am disappointed in this aaa service .
this is not what i expect when i buy my yearly membership .
this mobile battery truck is not service i trust .
they declined , and were told again they really should have the battery replaced .
it may be that you do not need a new battery .
unfortunately when i need az aaa they let me down .
they said it was the battery , and replaced my battery .
because come to find _num_ days later , it is not the battery .
i got nothing .
anyway , i ca n't express enough how much i hate this place .
this is a prime destination of american tourists .
i was disappointed .
late _num_ i had an experience that was just horrific with aaa .
i 'd purchased a aaa battery and just _num_ months later started having issues .
bad job kathy ... bad job .
i ca n't go to _num_ stars yet .
aaa is worthless .
tell me how you can help me not how you ca n't .
so disappointed with aaa .
had to walk three miles to purchase a battery in _num_ plus weather !
i wish i could rate them negative stars .
we have been loyal aaa customers for over _num_ years .
today they literally hung me out to dry .
it was a simple battery replacement that turned into a nightmare .
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
thus leaving me stranded in the dark alone .
therefore i ca n't write a letter of complaint .
aaa , this is an insulting way to treat your members .
waited _num_ minutes for a passport pic and no one else was in line !
i was _num_ hours late for work .
fail !
i am going to call my insurance company and get towing through them .
customer service is what is lacking though , hence the two stars .
no one working here goes really goes out of their way to be friendly .
it really felt like we were bothering him .
i have never felt so unwelcome in a business .
never acknowledged that we were there .
gave me a form to fill out and sat back down .
never opened the case , never explained the rental terms .
want pickles on your sandwich ?
_num_ cents more .
_num_ cents more .
employee taking order was short and rude .
i dunno ... was not feeling it at all .
this sandwich was to not have lettuce or tomatoes on it .
i trimmed away so much bread that had meat nowhere by it .
the pickle was really soggy too .
not a good value and portions have been reduced .
will not come here again .
if i had more than _num_ items i would n't have noticed .
some of us prefer to use that because the staff stinks .
it makes it seem like no customer service training is given for any employees .
had a horrible experience today .
it 's not even worth that new !
is that even meat in the _num_ cent tacos ?
the woman did n't even apologize .
if that 's your thing , this is your place .
takeout porterhouse steak was way undercooked , like half raw .
unfortunately by the time i found out i was miles away .
i 'm still waiting for the outback manager to get back to me .
we caught this outback serving reheated coconut shrimp tonight !
very disappointed !
the server repeated my order .
the manager apologized and said she would take my meal off of our ticket .
my daughter finished her meal , we left , i did not eat mine .
could not wait for them to try to get it right .
i do n't know , but i remember outback being better .
still , management did nothing to comp the clientele .
i just cant get my taste buds around it .
i tried several different steaks and was sorely disappointed every time .
the onion gets _num_ stars .
$ _num_ bill .
it 's obvious it was stale .
why would you even bring that out to me ?
after hearing the list of choices i chose one .
what was left was literally _num_ small bites .
the prime rib had no flavor .
the chocolate desert was good .
our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing .
blooming onion was a grease pit .
the burger was over cooked and dry .
it also had a tomato but instead of a nice red slice of tomato .
the waiter acted like he could not be bothered with the complaint .
it was difficult to get refills on drinks .
the manager acted like he did n't care .
why has this chain not closed yet with its 19th ' menu .
i do n't even know where to begin .
the food at outback is mediocre at best .
mahi mahi is dry .
left to have dinner elsewhere .
so not impressed .
the manager was the only good thing about this location .
server was rude especially to my husband .
i will not be going to this location again .
not as good as it used to be .
this use to be my favorite place to eat .
more then ruth chris or any of the high end places i 've experienced .
this is been one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant .
you need to print it off before going to the restaurant .
no instructions on the email .
gave up and left full payment .
never could use our gift card .
worst outback in the chain !
service and food were awful .
i agree with marcus s. just close the place already !
fridays & weekends , open for lunch .
worst service ever .
was not offered bread .
soup , salad , drinks , all served at the same time .
not for our table though .
i left hungry after ordering _num_ courses and sending the main entre back .
no dice !
no dice again .
the food was a disaster and everything looked like a punch in the stomach .
no dice !
overall this place is not the spot for food .
it is with much regret that i give a _num_ star review .
too much wrong to list ... just skip this one .
barely ?
this location is closed and probably will be forever .
horrible customer service , out of bread , out of meat .
nothing like this !
take these few reviews as a bad sign and keep looking !
the framing was a mess !
the customer service is not good .
it 's just not a good experience .
there 's really no other way to explain it ... just ... not good .
it took too long and no one seemed to know what was going on .
our home building through them has been a nightmare .
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
rather unfortunate .
hell wo n't take her because she gives them a bad name .
if i could give zero stars i would !
i got my car towed down the street _num_ blocks .
cold food , no flavor , and crappy service .
the person at serrano 's told me the price was _num_ !
went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow .
we had some margaritas - overly sweet and completely forgettable .
the fish was overcooked , and the other flavors blended into a mush .
everything else was just okay .
makes you wonder if they bother tasting anything first .
not the best , but certainly not the worst place in town .
i would have given this place _num_ stars prior to the recent experiences .
the new menu is horrible and does not work .
the new menu is confusing and the selection is too small .
it also tasted bland .
i miss the old food , menu and ambiance .
the restaurant was pretty empty after _num_ ... that tells you something .
wo n't do again , unless i just wanted a bowl of whole beans .
this place is terrible .
there 's nothing else on the menu worth ordering .
the food is not original or even tasty .
this is the first time this place let me down .
come here regularly but tonight was the worst .
cold food and the waitress was absent most the time .
disappointing experience .
messed up our order twice and took _num_ minutes to get our food .
stopped in to meet my wife for lunch .
we were not impressed by the food at all .
horrible !
then i got ants in my pants waiting and i went to the bar .
no bartender .
one bite would be medium , the next would be very spicy .
i usually go to the jiffy lube off chandler which provides great efficient service .
this place is why yelp should allow zero stars .
i was driving by today at lunch and saw the tanning sign .
big mistake .
ok , but there is no green button .
got ready and saw _num_ minutes on the timer , good to go .
hit the green button and ... nothing .
got dressed again and left the room .
clearly he pissed off more than one customer that day and got us confused .
sorry sal , did n't talk to you at all .
terrible , terrible company !
just posted a new , long review to explain .
terrible !
this company has terrible business practices !
they refuse to let me cancel .
not good business practice !
the owner says if i refuse to pay he will send me to collections .
for a stupid tanning membership that i 've already paid _num_ months !
sad that small businesses think this is how they have to operate .
so my daughter basically did n't eat for 24hrs .
i felt like the worst parent ever .
never again will i bring my child here not even for her follow up .
horrible place !
i worked with a women named tracy and she was rude and very inconsiderate !
she spoke very rudely to my daughter and she was _num_ .
my daughter was in tears and didnt even want to see the doctor .
worst people ever .
see a blonde named sam , stay away !
the office staff is even worse .
it was worse than dealing with my ex wife .
whatever you do do n't rent here .
whoever orders for health and beauty sucks and should be fired .
do n't see it adding anything to the overhead other than a juice machine .
i do not recommend bringing a young person here .
she went on and on and on about how horrible her nails look .
she was rude the whole time and rushed through my pedicure and nails .
will never spend my money here again .
rude , not worth _num_ dollars at all : ( ugh .
this place is horrible !
we sat on the couch for _num_ minutes waiting .
they immediately sat us in the pedicure chairs and started the water .
the rest of the experience was horrible .
i was finished with my appointment by 6:00 .
horrible place !
so no respect for the patients time .
thumbs down guys !
no complaints .
i called to let the office manager know what had happened .
the receptionist took down my name and number and nobody has called me back .
but could only get one _num_ weeks out .
very poor customer service .
i tried all three computers and none of them worked right .
so i printed my receipts and took them to the counter .
so i had to spend several hours getting it to go through .
his attitude was that he just did n't care .
they are very slow in the drive thru .
i hate this mcdonald 's .
worst ever .
i agree with everyone else , this mcdonalds is the worst .
it is melissa , and she sadly turns out to be the manager .
crappy food crappy service .
nothing to come back for any more .
walked in and smell just about knocked us over .
never ever go to this location if you are looking for fast food .
absolutely the worst service after dark .
i check my fries and they were old and cold .
your store owner lost a customer .
you trash received my entire order .
horrible customer service .
wo n't be eating there ever again .
while driving away , i noticed that my car drove worse when i left .
avoid this location !
fortunately , you saved yourself _num_ bucks .
unfortunately you lost a customer who has been using your shop for _num_ years .
they just want money .
dont walk .
not anymore .
i do n't like the front office staff .
they 're just not extremely kind or knowledgeable .
maybe they just do n't care .
also , he has one nurse practitioner who i can not stand !
horrible .
the receptionist are rude and impatient .
i have never been allowed to see a dr in a timely manner .
sit forever in a waiting room .
for _num_ minutes of face time and exam .
its frustrating .
there were _num_ other customers in the store needing assistance .
one lady walked out .
my husband went to get it and there was no one to help .
the sprint employee next door began looking for the radio shack employee .
the sprint girls was calling , oscar !
she came back and said , `` there is no one here .
the sprint employee could n't check him out .
i just had the most bizarre experience at this store .
grabbed my bags a my _num_ pack .
but i even said sorry for getting in her way .
but i was n't going to be rude .
so it 's my fault for buying beer there ?
so i am calling the gm tomorrow to get some answers .
go to frys they know how to treat the customer .
i feel sorry for anyone that has to work with her .
used to love this place but man has it gone down hill .
also , it made my tummy hurt .
tortillas are always stale .
you killed my taste buds .
it was soggy for starters .
and after a few bites i realized the dough was still raw .
like sticky dough , uncooked .
i was very disappointed and will not be returning .
it was soggy for starters .
and after a few bites i realized the dough was still raw .
like sticky dough , uncooked .
i was very disappointed and will not be returning .
i 'll still visit sport clips , just not this location .
they took my name and number instead and promised to get back to me .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
i 'm tired of the bait and switch .
when i showed up for my appointment there was no record of the appointment .
the owner was not available .
i will never go back , i would suggest others to do the same !
went for my appt and was there for hours .
very frustrating especially when you are paying a pretty penny !
not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service .
i am in for an oil change and some other service related items .
: ( i wish i could give negative stars .
wrong !
wrong !
while we were there , we asked about getting some new keys cut .
the guy at the parts counter said they could n't cut those keys .
why does the dealer think we have bags of money ?
probably going to report them to a consumer protection agency .
would never use again .
absolutely the worst dealership i 've ever been to .
and they said they would give me a $ _num_ gift card .
that is ridiculous !
bad customer service !
avoid this place at all costs .
so yes i get it , i took a risk buying a used car .
i wish i could give it zero stars .
bob her ... in the service department was arrogant and rude .
car was needed again for factory recall on a part .
i 'm finally writing a review , this is the last straw .
i do n't know how i can trust this dealership .
horrible service .
horrible craftsmanship , terrible business ethics and customer service .
worse service i have ever been to !
are you kidding me ?
cheat your customers !
stupid dealer !
this is _num_ % true .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
worst customer service i have ever had .
no one asked what i needed help with .
this store stinks .
my experience was frustrating and a poor one .
was very disappointed by the customer service .
we came in and nothing of ours was done .
improve your customer service , and you should probably get some different employees .
a terrible place .
i 've interacted with two employees during my two visits here .
customers are not your children .
i 'd give them _num_ stars if it was an option .
too much work for them obviously !
they obvious are n't environment friendly !
horrible service and lies about how they do things .
teach your employees customer service skills .
maybe you could have customers take a number to stay organized .
this is not his fault .
it seems like a group problem .
i was told my service would take _num_ minutes .
i finally approached the desk , he looked at me and walked away .
no `` i will be right with you '' , nothing .
they all looked at me and did nothing .
it would be nice if there was a nicer waiting area and better lighting .
ordered pecan chicken salad .
ordered the classic beef sandwich and arby fries to go .
the fries were terrible , over cooked and greasy .
wo n't make this mistake again .
it was an ok place .
we probably wo n't be returning .
absolutely no idea how this place got rated _num_ stars .
first off , it 's not a restaurant .
ordered one drink then got the hell out .
not very friendly at all , in not the nicest neighborhood in mesa .
and this week i am very , very upset .
the haircut that i got is in no way what i clearly asked for .
so i ordered _num_ honey bbq wings from this place .
heidi answers and says ok we will cancel the order for the wings .
the plus side is that i was offered new wings free of charge .
to send me wings without any sauce whatsoever is just ridiculous .
especially when my receipt reads `` _num_ boneless honey bbq . ''
mistakes happen , but this was no mistake .
barro 's started making the wings and did n't want to waste them .
i placed a call in order .
thanks for the total lack of customer service barro 's .
if that is the case , we 're all in trouble .
ok , now this place is n't looking too good .
unfortunately , things only got worse from here .
safe to say i will b paying them off and finding a nicer dentist .
even if it does cost me a little more .
commercial dentistry with no heart .
what !
stay far away from here !
the selection of things was n't that impressive .
nothing to burn sage in , and the stones were on the pricey side .
as we left the person i was with commented on it too .
not very in tune with a patient 's need to know .
called tuesday cuz no one called me .
so they said come in and get some more different samples .
he is a kind doctor but the procedure went horribly wrong .
still out $ _num_ plus not including original procedure .
nice doctor but horrible experience !
i do n't know what happened but this is n't a nail salon .
i told them no thanks and left before my appointment .
in summary , i was a fan before but now i 've experienced better .
a large cheese pizza would probably get you to the moon and back .
the ingredients were horrible .
the sausage looked more like ground beef , maybe it was .
not really sure what to make of that .
after a few slices i wished i had had more of the salad bar .
it was some of the worst food i have ever had .
and the bill , with tax , came to ten bucks flat !
if the blood work came back normal , they would need to do x-rays .
she tells me it will be $ _num_ .
she calls back _num_ mins later and tells me his blood work looks great .
_num_ mins later , i get a call ... x-rays look great .
ok ... so what 's wrong with him ?
so , i pay with my credit card .
no call .
we called for delivery , they do n't deliver .
i ordered the beef with broccoli and _num_ egg rolls .
and the beef with broccoli was bland as well .
i think she liked hers , she got the almond chicken .
she too did n't like the egg rolls .
the only reason i tried china china is because of good yelp reviews .
sweet and sour combo and i found it to be of low quality .
unfortunately china china restaurant is no longer there .
the only thing edible was their cut oranges .
dropped in to quality bumper a dealership recommendation for some running boards .
kept on said he would give me a great deal .
so eventually i cracked ... lol i paid for the boards and cover .
stated they would call when it was in , probably friday .
friday came , saturday went by no word .
worst customer service i have ever had .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
then he responded sorry i ca n't help you .
sadly , a horrible haircut was the result .
ummm thanks , but no thanks .
do yourself a favor and skip this unprofessional , substandard salon .
you 'll only end up disappointed if you do n't .
they were very patronizing , snotty and most of all over priced .
it 's been such a terrible experience trying to utilize her services we purchased .
when we just asked for a refund instead the owner was rude and refused .
apparently customer service is n't their strong point .
very poor experience .
it 's clear they want to turn the salon into a med day spa .
too bad .
they 've run off my business as well .
the front desk was very kind and helpful but the dr was very rude .
suggested some `` older people '' just can get get used to this type .
just got a royal oreo blizzard .
what made it royal was it had caramel in it .
was told its _num_ cents more because it is a royal blizzard .
worse blizzard i have ever eaten and ripped off by the price !
i 've been to plenty of jamba juice locations before .
but my experience at this particular store was just terrible .
i was left waiting in the store for almost half an hour .
horrible management .
lady cashier did n't give me my change .
manager refused said it 's store policy .
horrible customer service today !
the guy is ok , the women have their moments .
i said u wan na check me !
i have more money than ur whole god damn family lady .
i do not need to steal anything .
i was pretty dissapointed in this whole ordeal !
they are ashley pieces , they were pretty when new , but are awful .
total waste of money .
i purchased carpeting for my nursery from furniture plus .
no call , no nothing .
again , no call , no nothing .
he returned my call and said , oh it wasnt on the truck again .
if i could give this place negatives stars i would .
the services they provide are pathetic .
i 've went her many times because it is closely located to my home .
it has failed to impress me on each occasion .
speaking of pain , the time i had my acrylics done .
after the third one , i asked her to stop .
i was so angry !
she could have given me a warning .
just pathetic right ?
i had to go to the dr. never going again.
there are no smiles and no customer service .
last few times i 've come here my pizza has been wrong .
i could only find _num_ dresses that i was remotely interested in trying on .
my sales associate was awkward and did n't even introduce herself .
i would not recommend going to this bridal salon .
the service is definetly not so hot .
i have heard good things about this store and i was greatly disappointed .
i was sort of disappointed in suzanne 's bridal .
so , instead of saturday , i could take it home on sunday .
this only adds so much more stress to my last month before the wedding .
i wish , now , i had gone with a different shop .
suzanne herself did the alterations and it was perfection .
strike three , you 're out .
i know weddings do n't go perfectly .
the first appointment was a waste .
we went back for another appointment , hoping they would be less busy .
we waited for about _num_ minutes and no one came to help us .
they have terrible customer service .
seriously save yourself the time , money , and frustration go anywhere but here !
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
she also said they would order the dress 3-4 sizes bigger .
i would not recommend this place .
they are unpleasant and condescending .
my overall experience at suzanne 's was blah .
the girls were incredibly fake and just looking to make a sale .
even after i told her i would like to order the dress .
over all suzanne 's was extremely rude and not helpful .
stopped by to look , -- not impressed at all -- .
very poor lighting , dirty dressing rooms , very high prices .
i am not plus sized but i 'm also not a size _num_ .
there was _num_ dress i was able to try .
even after i told her i would like to order the dress .
over all suzanne 's was extremely rude and not helpful .
having searched for this dress for a long time , i was upset .
the bottom of the dress was black from the dirty floors .
it was disgusting .
i was so disappointed i could n't stand it .
her alterations were even worse !
i did not have a good experience here .
long story short , i did not have a pleasant experience .
it is really really overwhelming .
she was loud and did n't care that people were shopping .
i just changed and left as soon as i could because we were uncomfortable .
i would give a negative _num_ if i could .
gross !
totally inappropriate .
wo n't go back there ever again .
walked in and smells like urine really bad .
i asked for a beef patty and the patty was literally falling apart .
it was more like a ground beef nugget burger .
poor service and was not impressed by the food .
wait staff did n't seem interested when taking our order .
so anyways , i would n't go here again .
which we were about to leave for lack of service .
we got an orange soda , cherry pepsi and a kid pepsi .
then my son wanted mac n cheese and gold fish .
she said sorry and walked away ... .
still no soda .
she walked about about _num_ minutes later and we asked about his soda again .
she said _num_ moment and walked into the kitchen .
had we known back when we first ordered we probably would n't have stayed .
i also asked for a refill on my drink .
about _num_ minutes later his spaghetti comes out and the sauce was like water .
my sausage and hashbrowns were cold .
plus i still did n't get my refill .
worst service and experience ever !
i would n't trust these folks with my dog again .
i have been taking my for dogs here for several years .
she did not tell me when i picked them up .
by the time i got home my dog was bleeding again .
called the groomer and she said there was a cut nail .
this was horrible .
i thought maybe the groomer would be let go , but no .
just not kayla .
furthermore he could n't move his neck to the left .
this is so disappointing and unacceptable .
now my dog has pain medication and can not move his neck .
please do not use this dry cleaner !
the customer service here is terrible !
run to another dry cleaner !
i mean , not a good kinda smell like oh , smell that food !
this is not the kind of chinese food that i 'm used to .
the fried rice tasted like smoke from burnt oil .
some people might like that smoky flavor , i do n't know .
for example the chicken chow mien is with bean sprouts and not noodles .
i will never , i repeat never visit this establishment again .
the total for that nonsense was _num_ .
rude !
it was like buffet style food in a restaraunt setting .
and i could n't really eat any of it .
i ate some sticky rice just to get by .
would n't go back unless i had already eaten .
the lady that took the order said no msg in their food .
it may have been understandable , but she was not polite about it either .
who needs bad information and poor customer service , we decided no more .
we 've gotten their food a few times now and it 's not bad .
this is nothing more that overpriced takeout .
the restaurant and bar are old and poorly kept .
the orange chicken was good but the curry chicken was watery and bland .
the fried rice had no vegetables or egg or anything else in it .
based on the previous yelp reviews i was expecting mediocre , at best .
however the food at this place was just gross .
add that to the horrible service- we wont be back .
there was _num_ of us in our party , we were seated right away .
it was all downhill from there .
apparently the elderly like gross food .
ordering food online and picking it up never gets a tip from me .
i asked for extra green onions in my mongolian beef .
did n't see it .
however , beef was very tender , but not impressed .
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
the vegetables were ok , chicken was overcooked according to person eating it .
the chicken in the chicken chow mein was not chicken .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
all of it was like leftovers from other plates .
wish there was a negative star .
their kung pao chicken was soggy .
every dish was flavorless .
it was just as awful the second time we ordered .
if they clean the place up it would be pretty good .
food was terrible .
really wanted authentic chinese food and everything was fried and mushy .
i do n't even want to give it a single star .
worse place and food ever .
bad lighting .
cups smelled of old dirty dish water .
the food was not even remotely close to fresh .
gross .
rachel is the nightmare on top of the nightmare cake !
_num_ teachers in one year .
i 'm confused by all these stars .
again , i 'm just so confused .
i came here to buy fudge for christmas and it is completely closed down !
this location has been closed for months .
- in this case it was customer no service !
- my car battery died .
a few days later it was flat again .
handed me the work order and tells me to fill this out .
and the place smells very bad .
too cheesy , too flavorless , etc .
i received a vanilla brownie sunday instead of chocolate .
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
worst sonic ever !
food was wrong and tasted like it was left overs from last week .
tonight marks the worst fast food restaurant experience i have ever encountered .
this is n't the first time i 've had issues with this sonic .
it is sad because i always liked sonic .
this is the worst location ever !
i 've had a number of bad experiences .
they always get my order wrong .
the employees do n't care and the wait is soooo long !
slow .
i 'm literally just sitting here waiting .
it 's been at least _num_ minutes .
always tired at the end of the day .
this place sucks for customer service .
avoid this place .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
horrible customer service .
terrible location .
_num_ were over _num_ weeks expired .
it took over _num_ minutes to check out .
so sad !
the guy on the phone was very rude .
lost my business .
the area dedicated for the buffet area is too small to service their customers .
lesson learned !
stopped here to get some food real quick .
it was not anything special .
the place was kind of overpriced too since they food is not that good .
definitely not going back , i suggest you do n't go either .
i used to go to this restaurant , long ago .
she brought us no napkins .
we were eating bbq , you must have napkins with bbq .
eventually , our drinks ran out - me and bbq ?
i can laugh about it now , i was pissed at the time .
his apology was pathetic .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
give me _num_ % off the meal and i 'll be happy .
hey , you got ta tip em ' .
without the tips , they sink .
not as good as before .
salmon not tasty , salad over loaded with dressing .
slow service .
took _num_ minutes from arrival to being served .
it was 12:30 pm , asked for breakfast menu , never brought it .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
speed of service was a little slow but friendly .
i ordered steak and eggs , my wife ordered beef brisket and eggs .
( useless ) needless to say we will not return .
it was the worst experience i have ever had .
went in for lunch around 1pm .
also , never got checked up on .
the staff were all just standing around .
i am so upset it makes me sick !
this is the worst cleaner i have ever visited .
also , they are super expensive .
i honesty did n't want to eat the whole thing .
gross !
worst gyro ever it was greasy , very little meat and sauce .
i would never go back .
the gyros are ok but the staff is rude .
if you value your money and dont waste your time dining here .
if they make a mistake you pay for it .
dry and a bit stale bread and the gyro meat was dry .
not much room so do n't bring too many with you .
guy says it will be _num_ minutes if i want the kabob .
note there are _num_ other people in the whole place .
i could have made that salad in _num_ minutes tops .
rude , rude , rude !
here take your $ _num_ back !
i felt so bad for her .
i guess i 'm gross but whatever .
it 's a shame , i wo n't be back .
i gave it two stars only because it was ready on time .
the crust was one of the worst i have ever had .
worst of all , it cost almost $ _num_ !
does anyone know how to answer the phone there ?
beware this place will rip you off !
on to the food , my wife 's portion to the feast was salad .
for $ _num_ she received _num_ salads that fit in two small containers .
an hour seems a bit long for a place _num_ miles away .
$ _num_ off the next pie ok ?
ok $ _num_ off the next .
no high hopes here .
r u kidding me ?
long black hair baked carefully in the center of the pie !
we ordered a chicago style deep dish pizza from here tonight .
when i got the pizza home it just looked sparse on toppings .
the crust was also skimpy and thin .
i should have checked out the reviews before ordering !
the pizza had very little sauce and was incredibly dry !
there were _num_ mushrooms when my order arrived .
the chicken was burnt so badly .
salad was forgotten .
ranch was forgotten .
same goes for the garlic cheese bread .
do n't waste your money .
absolutely the the most awful pizza i ever ate !
we also ordered mild wings .
ordered a small vegetarian pizza no cheese again !
it was all just gross !
most disgusting pizza i 've ever tasted .
very disappointed .
wasted money .
still not quite `` right '' today .
saw the crowds as i drove by and stopped in .
update my last few trips caused me to stop coming here .
just do not plan to have that stuff very long .
you will not find better prices , but you get what you pay for .
my son eats strawberries everyday , i could n't pass it up !
i 'm so disappointed as i love to shop local .
did n't even say hello .
everything is super cheap but it 's all almost rotten .
containers of berries have a few moldy ones in it .
i 'm not even sure it is safe to step foot inside !
i have now been twice and both times walked out with nothing .
i ca n't get past how crowded and busy and this place is .
so friday , i decided to stop in and pick up a few things .
sir , seriously ?
are you not at work ?
too much produce is coming from south of the border and tastes terrible .
the strawberries are tough and flavorless .
i used to buy excellent blueberries there but no more .
really hate this place first your have to fight your way through there .
smell was awful .
produce looked like trash .
a year ago i would have rated this place _num_ stars .
they used to have great deals on something almost every time you went .
bad customer service !
fruit are cheap but it 's not a very good quality .
i rather pay a little more for a better quality .
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
pull up in my _num_ bmw .
oh , no , no , no !
go to jiffy lube on power and broadway . ''
so , here i am .
in a bay and getting my oil changed .
horrible dentist .
the food was served in steam trays and was very unappetizing to start with .
the ice cream was cold & the fudge was hot .
when i sent an email to comment it was not answered for a week .
i would not recommend this theater for your dining experience .
i would skip this one in the future .
the food was horrible !
that is completely unethical and makes me sick that a company would do this .
it 's the principle of it that makes me so angry .
we took the tour august _num_ , _num_ and bought future tickets .
shame on them for taking advantage of us only _num_ weeks before closing !
i just got ripped off for an up coming show in december .
while the drive-thru was quick , the food was terrible .
fries were also cold .
i would advise strongly against this location .
cleaning .
out black !
he was so obnoxious and loud trying to entertain everyone that walked in .
i could n't believe it !
this is a nightmare : i am paying to be insulted !
everyone was staring at me and it was extremely embarrassing .
he 's more suited to clean the toilets then interact with people .
he is annoying , cheesy and rude .
the service was very slow , which i wo n't hold against them .
the bread is garbage .
probably the worst part of my night there .
the rest of our meal did n't get much better .
the pasta we ordered was disappointing .
small portions , small taste , big cost .
the reviews i read did not describe the food i ate .
not the worst i 've ever had , just the most disappointing .
unfortunately , i was wrong .
about _num_ minutes later some bread arrived which was pretty disappointing .
soupy pasta sauce , very unremarkable house salad .
not great atmosphere in a little strip mall would not return .
quaint little place hidden in mesa az .
the bread was n't good at all .
the rosemary flavor was a little overwhelming but in general was ok .
service was not poor food way to over priced !
my husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo .
i just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters .
normally at italian restaurants the calamari is fried , but not here .
i did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup .
this place is such a rip off .
the inept greeter told us that the wait would n't be long .
we have not been acknowledged since we 've been sitting here .
the rest was rather bland .
price $ _num_ for _num_ raviolis .
to say this was a disappointment would be too kind .
if this is italian , dominos is pizza .
my wife ordered fettuccine , with alfredo sauce .
it was like water , without taste .
we were expecting a very good meal , and were very disappointed .
entrees , desserts , yum .
but some apology with some ownership would have been nice .
the bread was well let 's say i have had better .
the sauce was runny & too many onions .
i felt sick after eating there .
the only good thing was the dessert .
no plans to return .
we waited over _num_ minutes to be seated so we just left .
the bread that was served was n't good , it tasted old .
our bruschetta appetizers were disappointing as well , we ordered all three .
we had chicken marsala , chicken piccata and a pasta dish as well .
the chicken piccata had almost no lemon flavor .
we skipped dessert as we were already disappointed with our meal .
- atmosphere was cramped .
they have some weird system where everyone helps out with all tables .
pity , they had something good which seems to have gone downhill .
the service was great but the food was no good .
my husband is italian so this was not a great experience .
_num_ reviews & this place has _num_ stars ?
there was _num_ of us and we ordered different things .
they did n't even offer to comp us an app .
we did n't realize we would have over a hour wait for food .
the pasta was all supposed to be a scratch made ... a total lie .
i get around the arizona restaurant seen .
i felt so bad for recommending the place i picked up the bill .
for the other in my group it was just too much .
i hate olive garden but it 's better then this place !
horrible food & even worse service .
go buy a $ _num_ bottle of ragu and a box of pasta .
bread was burned and sauce tasted like cold tomato soup !
disgusting !
warning : do not visit !
at night , this place is always run by a bunch of assholes .
they constantly have their friends here to chat and smoke cigarettes with .
car wash takes money but out of service .
crystal should be fired !
previously there was n't much wait and things went smoothly at his old location .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
my child goes to see a doctor here .
the front desk crew is not very welcoming or very nice .
they have to finish theory conversations before helping anyone standing at the counter .
their customer service skills are way below par for being in the medical industry .
no bedside manners at all .
not acceptable !
the office staff at this office is absolutely horrible .
incompetent & rude !
i am so very disappointed with all aspects of this office .
if they questioned anything , he would get incredibly short with them .
customer service is just always awful .
i did n't know i was going to get them _num_ hours before .
it makes me sad that everyone who works here is so unhappy .
maybe it 's like her coworker said , this is n't a subway .
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
took it back and he was very helpful .
he thanked me for being honest and said he 'd get me fixed up .
do n't waste your time !
cost might be low but they do not stand behind their products !
more like a big corporate machine that does n't care about their customers !
nope , way way worse .
first off , it was breaded like sweet and sour chicken usually is .
hands down , the worst chinese food that i have ever had .
i mean for real , this place was such a let down .
i felt like crap the next day too .
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
not sure .
not even real brown sauce .
the app we got sucked as well .
we were greeted quickly and sat at a booth .
no attempt was made to clean the floor .
i do n't get it .
why do restaurant owners forget what they are in business for .
this restaurant missed the mark on both counts .
this place is n't even worth the _num_ star .
all i ordered was chicken fried rice , and chicken wings .
they were so dried out , i could barely bite into them .
total waste of $ $ .
food is ok , kind of bland .
chicken was chewy and cold .
nothing special about service either .
my bf picked up chinese since i mentioned that i was craving some .
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
the eggroll was pretty mushy inside , maybe sat around too much .
the shrimp lo mein had good flavor and shrimp was plump and not overcooked .
the only pro would be that they deliver .
i ordered boneless pork , and the meat looked old .
it was dry , and the sauce they used was n't good .
the pork lo mien was a disappointment as well .
the white rice was also dry .
they said there food was ok , but nothing spectacular .
i would have giving zero star but that was not an option .
there was plenty of room and no line .
this was not acceptable and we left .
shame on you !
shame ... on ... you for having no compassion and accommodating our family .
ok , so normal delivery form this place is maybe a 3-4 .
and asked for sauce on the side so my noodles wo n't get soggy .
and look how much noodles you get for $ _num_ .
and another thing ... ... slow slow slow service .
7:30 p.m. - i made my order at 5:30 .
chicken fried rice , cream cheese puffs , and a sprite .
_num_ minutes go by , nothing .
then why did you tell me it was on the way ?
this school is ran very poorly .
teachers are good but administration is terrible .
the guy came and talked for about _num_ hours .
poor customer service with no value for the customer .
these people break the law and do n't care .
i had to tell him _num_ times that she was n't interested .
a few days later they called me again to set up an appointment .
do not bother me anymore !
place is a rip off !
never use again , better off going to full service for $ _num_ !
i 've been here before and today was different .
he insisted that i need synthetic because otherwise it will void my dealership warranty .
i tried telling him that i do n't have a warranty on the car .
_num_ weeks later they had n't even started on it .
probably the worst experience i 've ever had .
i was in and out in _num_ min for a drug test .
to hell with next care .
if there was an option to give negative stars , i would .
it 's a disgrace .
rude people , awful service , long wait times .
that is , if you also like rude people .
a waste of time and money !
i went in december because i was ill and not sure what was wrong .
i had a fever and could n't get warm .
so next time , i will wait and see my own physician .
this was not the first time we have been disappointed by this facility .
we feel the staff here is inexperienced and needs additional training .
would give it _num_ stars if i could .
next time i would pay a hospital for x-rays , and real medical treatment .
the lady at the front desk was really sarcastic and rude to me .
she could care less to see me hurting .
only because i ca n't give zero stars .
this time , i was really unsatisfied .
on the upside , employees were friendly .
gone there twice this past week .
the sandwiches had a lack of flavor .
will not being going back or recommending it to anyone .
it looked like a store bought hamburger bun with shredded cheese melted on top .
the eggs were absolutely horrid and were mushy .
i will not be returning .
old owner and staff very friendly .
i 've searched the valley for a bagel .
bagel nosh ai n't it .
the new owners do n't seem to have a clue .
i really hate to say this because i always try to support local .
i am not kidding when i tell you _num_ minutes to stand in line .
so disappointed .
this is supposed to be fast food .
new travels quickly and need to turn this around quickly .
i hate to see this place go under .
i 'm sorry but i must agree with several of the most recent reviews .
the biggest disappointment is the poor quality with this new ownership .
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .
after waiting _num_ minutes , she came out and asked me again .
but instead , i repeated my order to her .
this morning hubby and i decided to try again .
it tasted like _num_ oz .
too bad , because i like supporting mom and pop joints versus chain restaurants .
took _num_ minutes to get a toasted bagel and egg sandwich .
with only one person in line ahead of us found this to be ridiculous .
bagels are good but service is terrible .
this place is about 1/4 mike from my home .
i have been here only _num_ times since they opened .
they were completely out of plain bagels .
i will not be back anytime soon which is a shame .
bagels are good but service is terrible .
this place is about 1/4 mile from my home .
i have been here only _num_ times since they opened .
they were completely out of plain bagels .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
there were _num_ young men behind the counter .
i will not be back anytime soon which is a shame .
a guy can out and looked confused as to why i was there .
went here on a whim and i regret i did .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
i will not be back !
a little slow , but most sonic 's are so i get it .
plus two stars because , hello ... cheeseburgers .
obviously i 'm lazy - i 'm eating at sonic !
minus one star because bugs are gross but i 'm still a reasonable person .
it 's not like it went in my mouth or anything .
no more , sonic .
no more .
unfortunately they would not honor the price because it was their happy hour .
the happy hour price is not the same as what was advertised .
it was soggy and gross .
likely wo n't come back to this location .
did i mention that i was served the wrong food .
and not just a little wrong but completely a different dish .
this place was such a disappointment .
i felt sick after leaving and needless to say i will not be back .
from the moment we walked in - there was a lack of attention .
terrible !
may there not be any roaches in your food or table !
not me .
schnitzel was as tough as leather .
this time almost on the edge of not worth eating .
do n't waste your time !
the coffee was horrible , and the ice tea was flavorless even with lemon .
the salad bar was pathetic and the soup was mediocre at best .
i told her this , and _num_ minutes later we received our plates .
the potatoes from dinner taste like boxed potatoes and not seasoned well .
i ordered something with rolled beef with carrots and pickle in it .
not worth the money .
a _num_ year old could have made it .
then deep fried or pan fried .
bland .
no spices .
the beef was dry .
the side of mixed vegetables tasted of freezer burn .
then never came back to check on us .
we each ate approximately _num_ or _num_ bites of our food .
lastly , the salad bar is nothing to write home about .
we visited here for lunch and were somewhat disappointed .
the mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh .
disgusting food , everything was gross !
i would give this place a negative star rating if possible .
bavarian point used to be that way .
literally , there was no one eating there but our party .
btw it is expensive and we had no drinks either .
so disappointing on so many levels .
i do n't like this place at all .
this was our second time visiting the restaurant for lunch .
the service is extremely poor .
the bread was frozen bread , the soup tasted like out of a can .
i can personally cook a german meal _num_ fold better than they did .
even if it had been good , it was way overpriced .
sorry , ill never go back , recommend you try somewhere else .
not the restaurants problem but it was a sign .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
but still no bread basket .
by then a customers had given up and left without their food .
she brought that out midway thru the dinner .
the bill was $ _num_ for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .
i left a _num_ % tip due to the piss poor service .
it was an awful experience !
not only was the food bad and overpriced , the service was terrible .
after waiting for a while , the busser finally brought us waters and silverware .
is n't that funny ? ''
it really was n't funny .
of course , we would n't see her for a while after that .
i need two seconds .
just two seconds , okay ? ''
after i responded , `` i 'm just really hungry .
`` , she said , `` well , we 're very busy tonight . ''
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
the mashed potatoes tasted like it came from a box .
the whole meal was disappointing .
after _num_ minutes , all we had was water .
the waitress was complaining the entire time about being overworked .
we will never return , and will strongly advise against eating there .
do n't know her name , she never introduced herself .
no refilling drinks ... and the list goes on .
to our disappointment our server was the nasty waitress .
long story short , we will not return to bavarian point .
this is by far some of the worst german food i 've tasted .
he may be a good dentist but it does not mean anything .
i could not visit without paying hundreds of dollars first .
i wrote my first review way too soon .
i took my dog there for grooming & they neglected her in their care .
they were neither compassionate or sensitive & have poor business practices .
so you just stand there .
by sitting with other parties at the same table we met new people .
the food was okay , i was really hoping to be more impressed .
prices for each were very reasonable and we also had a restaurant.com card .
i really missed vegetables and salad .
the service was slow for a monday night !
terribly disappointing !
the only authentic german food in arizona prepared by an actual chef !
it was so salty i could n't eat it ) .
after reading the glowing reviews i had to try this place .
oddly , this german restaurant opened next to bavarian point .
you have _num_ choices for german food in the same strip mall .
there is very little variety here .
the food is not bad , but not great either .
the service is also not great in my experience .
the first time i ate here i waited _num_ minutes for my check .
the servers were nowhere to be seen .
go to bavarian point instead .
the veal and pork osso bucco are to die for !
the schnitzel was dry and the breading used was not authentic .
potato salad was watery .
the ambiance is very authentic , too bad the food was so disappointing .
nothing to go out of your way for .
not vegetarian friendly .
they are over priced .
glad i left without giving my business .
this was probably the worst chinese food i 've ever forced down .
the lo mein was the same way and my wife could n't eat it .
later that night my wife was in pain from the food .
however , my last visit couple of weeks ago has me warning others .
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
this makes me worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen .
then where the sauces are it was filthy .
crap everywhere .
and the staff was okay , if not a little inexperienced .
but the food quality was n't good for the price .
sorry to say , it was n't even worth that .
so the owner is waiting on tables .
diner beware , the owner is nuts .
not really sure what has happened .
but this place has really gone down hill .
service was a little slow .
it was missing a pancake .
this was probably the only really good thing about the meal .
the carpet looks like it has n't been cleaned in _num_ years .
my husband had a hot roast beef sandwich & it was very bland .
my salad was a little better .
we walked in and were hit with the dated decor and peeling wallpaper .
we sat here for _num_ minutes before a waitress came over .
nothing special let me tell you !
the biscuits were fluffy but tasted like a mix , not fresh made .
the sausage links were equal to what is served in hospital or buffet line .
this was our 1st and last visit .
do not recommend !
the receptionist brenda is very rude .
very rude and no customer service etiquette .
they over charge .
i am counting down the days until my lease is up .
do not rent here .
this is the worst place to live .
the girls in the office are all rude , no personality .
they lie to you about fees and then change them after you move in .
maintenance is a joke .
pools are yellow and dirty all the time .
the parking is terrible .
the laundry room is filthy and unsanitary , garbage bins are constantly overflowing .
please look elsewhere before even considering renting here .
this review is long overdue .
it 's unfortunate that bad things happen to good people .
there was blue dye all over my walls .
she ca n't help me .
this apartment is clearly a death trap .
they are n't even willing to move me to another unit .
i do n't think i can stay another day to be honest .
this place is awful !
they are charging me _num_ in fees for their fuck up !
expect a terrible experience , expect nothing .
the keys were all wrong and could not get in .
the carpet had just been replaced but the apartment was never cleaned .
i have also put in _num_ , maybe more , work orders .
but they are charging late fees on late fees .
and they charge me $ _num_ late fees .
rosa was no help .
where do i begin with this place .
i went there at around _num_ o'clock and it was n't very busy .
they were out of napkins and ketchup .
plus the garbage was overflowing .
this location was disgusting .
it smelt like this establishment had n't been cleaned in months .
ca n't handle the heat , get out of the kitchen .
no big deal right ?
she then tells me that i am taking time away from helping other customers .
after she replaced my order she refused to return my receipt to me .
to be treated this way by a drive thru employee is unacceptable .
i will not continue to support the wendy 's mission .
there are loads of restaurants in the area .
after this last time i will not return .
customer service is a joke .
they give back the wrong change constantly .
check your policies and hire people who will follow them .
the guy is confused .
it was gross and a waste of money .
booked appointment online waste of time .
at the time we were using the spare tires i just put on .
also costco is open sundays to do tires which discount is n't .
been going here for about _num_ years .
so he would n't fix it .
if it used to be safe , why is n't it safe now ?
i 'm sure people who have money to burn say they 're great .
it not , i suggest elsewhere .
it seems if you 're not buying something you 're made to wait longer .
total waste of time .
and they only wore them for pictures and a start clinic .
are you kidding me ?
now that is terrible costumer service .
nope , they were n't going to do anything !
my problem was with her work .
disappointing .
this has been my neighborhood kfc for about _num_ years .
my order is simple , two lousy pieces of original dark chicken .
the very chicken this chain was built upon .
i 've never been able to walk in to this store and get it .
they just never seem to have their basic food available upon request .
so tonight i tried their new grilled version .
well this unfortunately is not it !
speaking of the food here the quality has gone way down .
not me !
bad mistake .
`` sorry sir .
how is that my problem that you are low on inventory ?
at this point i gave up .
food was ok but nothing special .
place really sucks .
the pepsi and the side came with the signature combo at no extra charge .
the total cost was $ _num_ before taxes .
when he repeated my order , it was correct .
however , she handed me a receipt for the mistaken order .
she appeared very angry at my request , and called her manager again .
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
i did not feel i was being unreasonable .
not hard at all , i worked here when i was _num_ .
a receipt should show an accurate transaction .
this is the 3rd time i have been told this .
i 'm pretty sure it only takes 5-10 minutes to fry some chicken .
someone needs to do a better job managing this location .
also the one time i did get fried chicken from this location ... .
it tasted old and dry .
well i was going to a picnic i stopped for a bucket of chicken .
apparently they ca n't tell the different between legs and breast .
horrible .
gel polish seemed old .
i felt like the work done was n't worth the price paid .
however , the workers were friendly .
i will not being going back .
i 'm sad that i wasted my money .
i will not be back , and i will not recommend .
worst experience ever .
very unfortunate for my first pregnancy .
you only ever see a pa never the doctor .
i will not be going back .
poor customer service and poor patient care .
no , no no !
all the ladies i referred to this office have left too .
then there is the sales pitch for cosmetic and diet bs .
makes me wonder if our state cares about women 's health ?
this was a bad experience .
she was very disappointed .
we will not use arizona rose company again .
emailed the company and got no response .
i have went to this location and the customer service is terrible .
the food is not bad but the people are very rude .
i would say lady but she did n't act like one .
first , the enchilada , refried beans and rice were cold on both plates .
the green chilis were tough and needed a steak knife to cut .
the burrito must have been made by an asian .
news flash : new asian and mexican vegetables - onion and bell pepper .
i will eat at other places .
yesterday morning i ordered a sausage burrito through the drive-thru .
i then bit into it only to find it was ham and not sausage .
it tasted like an omelet ... which i did not want !
i was charged $ _num_ , which my bank app can verify .
needless to say , filiberto 's has forever lost my business and respect .
at least once a week , sometimes more , we shop there .
there does not appear to be a location at this address .
it 's a very very small place you ca n't .
they have no bathroom around three small tables inside and out .
workers where meh adding to the feeling that they do n't want you there .
not good for a very pregnant women !
its been a month and nothing !
each visit i have gotten the _num_ wash .
besides why should they care , they already got my money !
it 's pretty disappointing to say the least .
i will not be going back .
the car was not cleaned well .
needless to say we will not be returning .
they tried pushing a $ _num_ car wash on me .
enter at your own risk , they use some pushy / slimy sales tactics .
needless to say i was underwhelmed by this place .
as far as the food , that 's where i was underwhelmed .
problem was one showed $ _num_ lb .
i know dry aged and neither top sirloin was dry aged .
unfortunately , the meal was mediocre at best .
for a butcher , we expected a good steak .
the hamburger was over cooked and the fries to salty to eat .
i politely refused , and he gave me a dirty look .
waitress took over twenty minutes to wait on us .
i had promised my christmas guests crown roast .
i understand things go wrong .
i 've probably spent a few hundred dollars there previously this year .
the omelette has a spaghetti sauce and some shredded cheese on top .
heard rave reviews about this place unfortunately the restaurant was not quality food !
the stuffed burger lacked seasoning and taste !
the cod fish lacked flavor .
fifty dollars later and i left hungry and grossed out !
we had dinner here tonight for my husbands birthday .
first of all , we waited for about _num_ minutes to even get water .
the place was not busy , but there was no sense of urgency whatsoever .
they brought rolls , which i was not impressed with .
the food was mediocre at best .
the vegetable of the day was some gross mixed veggies from a can .
i was craving donuts , and decided to stop in for a couple .
the woman helping me seemed miserable .
the donuts are delicious , but they lack customer service .
the restaurant section is awful .
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
once the food was delivered the server was never to be found .
food was average but the service was terrible !
we asked only _num_ questions and were met with curt responses .
i have a complaint on service every time i go here .
checking on my complaint in april _num_ on yelp it seems it was removed .
yet when i sign in to my yelp account it is indeed listed .
much worse than a car salesman .
i do n't think so dick head .
ordered a omelet and the waitress asked how do you want your eggs .
the gravy from the biscuits and gravy was wall paper paste .
this review is for the restaurant .
very poor service .
wow anna the waitress was the rudest one one here .
because i was craving pecans , i got the baklava and pecan baklava .
the pecan one was dry and the other one was average .
dishonest business practices .
employees would not honor prices on their own website during memorial day weekend .
food is n't nothing to rave about .
it 's very bland and nothing to write home about .
not to many side dish options .
if she 's doing that imagine what she 's doing to the store owner .
let someone else get hired that wants to work .
if you want someone friendlier you better go somewhere else .
i had a piece of metal letting air escape from one of my tires .
unfortunately , customer satisfaction takes a back seat to ... , something else .
mode from the customer service representative ( not the mechanic ) .
this was not , despite the length , intended to be a rant .
really .
i already called the corporate number and gave feedback to the corporate web site .
i encourage everyone o spread the word and start standing up for yourself .
this one would have to be the worst .
place is small , machines are even smaller , and prices are outrageous .
get my point ?
no bathrooms !
this is the worst applebees i have been too .
i went with _num_ friends and our waitress was really rude .
not crowded @ about 1:30 p.m. we always sit in the bar area .
not a good idea to have the bartender wait tables .
he seemed totally disinterested but he did comp my lunch .
this applebees has gone downhill in the past several years .
worst applebee 's every .
took _num_ min for someone to get my water .
once our food finally came out , things didnt get any better .
the buffalo wings were tasty , but my steak was dry and tough .
it 's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it .
this location seems be in epic fail mode .
plus , no side veggies , no bread , nothing .
will try to avoid it .
do you like the game of hit and miss ?
tonight was a disaster from the moment i walked in .
the ice queen ( dark hair - tattoos ) only checked on me once .
i really want to like this applebee 's but i just do n't .
i keep trying and am disappointed every time .
we recently went there for dinner and the service was awful .
i do n't understand why this is so difficult to get right !
our waitress gave a pathetic , `` eh , sorry '' and walked away .
service is terrible !
skipping it altogether would be my recommendation !
maybe i 'm weird in that way .
yesterday , me and my mom went to this location to get lunch .
) , but the food was a complete bust .
the mozzarella sticks were bland and the sauce was a really weird flavor .
i ordered the fiesta lime chicken , and it was a reheated nightmare .
the spanish rice was also dry , looked old , and was pretty bland .
why is this place busy ?
burger and salmon were both over cooked ; third entre presentation was blah .
towels smelled bad .
could feel every spring in the bed and pillows were a joke .
whole place smelled of stale smoke .
i 'm visiting mesa from los angeles .
but she was not nice about it .
so i walked in the _num_ heat to an atm and back .
where she thinks i was hiding a dog , i 'll never know .
no complaints about the room itself .
he 's a middle aged , boring looking business guy .
i go down to check out .
technically , i was ripped off too .
though i 'm sure normal looking folks do n't receive this sort of treatment .
i 'm still beyond offended .
would n't recommend this place to only trashy people !
sadly in need of an update .
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
the only positive thing i can say is that the room was clean .
the office staff is very incompetent !
the wait time is always more than an hour and a half long .
this is the worst experience we have ever had .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
if i could give them zero stars i would !
would n't stay here again if it was the last place on earth .
all in all , nasty place .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
lobby is a bit dated , no biggie because it was pretty clean .
got to room _num_ ... .
the toilet was loose .
the tv was very old and dated and the reception was not that good.
there was a mini fridge in the room , that worked well.
the sink area was clean .
all of our towels were clean .
i have never been so disgusted with a hotel .
i quickly ran to the walmart to buy some towels .
save your money and sleep in your car .
boy was i wrong , and taken advantage of .
really , tell me this after i am there ?
there is nothing nice to say about this `` clinic '' .
from the time we walked in , it was an issue .
the wait to get in the room was over _num_ minutes .
the office staff insisted i pay right then and there before any treatment .
we 've used this clinic for about _num_ years with _num_ dogs .
the overall experience was just ok .
that is not the case anymore .
she came in and said it was hard to tell what it was .
the most questions we asked the more annoyed she got .
she shaved the hair off and looked it it for a long time .
i do n't recommend brown rd animal clinic to anyone at all .
dryers do n't dry half the time .
place looks like crap .
chuck just keeps raising the prices and wonders why no one comes in .
gross !
worst customer service ever !
a miles motel desk clerk .
by far the worst place out there .
i rented a room and it was too run down to stay in .
they declined and told me there was nothing they could do .
needless to say i had to get the police involved .
scary neighborhood too .
no stars for this place .
this could very well be the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
it will be a cold day before i would buy anything from this place .
so that 's pretty shady and not cool .
which was a total bait and switch see offer below .
i immediately said forget it and walked out .
i called groupon and immediately they agreed and apologized and refunded me my money .
today i had a similar experience as joey .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
thank you for purchasing the groupon for made in the shade !
unfortunately , there was an error in the original fine print for this offer .
tint removal not included . ''
our apologies for any confusion this may cause .
had to pay an additional $ _num_ .
: - [ could have paid less money and time somewhere else .
it 's not real .
i ca n't stand it .
but neither one sounds intelligent .
god can use anyone , anywhere for his glory .
very very poor business operation .
the big sign out front says $ _num_ .
well , the photo is _num_ years old .
check out time is 10am .
running all over like they own the place .
now it 's not major but the job was not done perfect .
trust me , that will ruin your day .
and they are lucky to get _num_ star !
well as a resident let me just say you are severely lacking !
i suggest you save your money and bring your own beverages and lunch .
spend your money elsewhere .
the golf course was not in great shape .
the greens looks as if they were lacking water .
i agree with other posts that the starter was rude .
the course is hard enough as it is without all that going on .
there are more friendly places to play and i will not be going back .
also our cart died on the last hole .
my problem was with the facilities .
very disappointed in the facilities .
unfortunately , it was a huge disappointment .
however , the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls !
hot rice is disgusting !
they also only had _num_ sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant .
the rice to fish ratio was totally off .
it looked like a total mess .
first , the prices are low and pieces are huge .
too big actually .
i 've had better sushi but it was cheap so that was a plus .
i am sorry to say i was deeply disappointed .
this place is mediocre at best .
even the edamame was so so and that is hard to screw up .
the only thing that caught my attention was the very large portions of sashimi .
this has been our go to sushi restaurant for the last _num_ years .
unfortunately , last night was nothing to rave about .
the service was horrible , and we waited almost _num_ hours for our sushi .
when we finally got our sushi , the rice and rolls just fell apart .
they were certainly was not the sushi we were used to .
she had no clue what i was trying to tell her .
i have been coming here regularly for _num_ year .
i informed the waitress , but she did not understand me .
she left the bowls at the table .
but do not eat entree 's .
i just ordered to go the mongolian chicken $ _num_ .
not freshly made or prepared .
nasty .
sadly , i was n't impressed at all .
the sushi was drowning in eel sauce , all over my plate .
very disappointing for a place that normally gets _num_ stars here on yelp .
service was ok , but nothing to get excited over .
interior design is very dated and in need of a complete deep cleaning .
got major attitude from the owners waitress .
judge a book by its cover .
the tempura shrimp tasted like frozen microwaved .
it was soggy , rubbery and limp .
yikes , i give this place _num_ stars .
the tempura was awful .
soggy , not crispy at all and not made correctly .
yikes , i give this place _num_ stars .
the tempura was awful .
soggy , not crispy at all and not made correctly .
dinner is overpriced and the service leaves a lot to be desired .
not worth the price .
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
over the last two years the food quality is consistently going downhill .
the food and mixed drinks are hit or miss everytime .
the coffee is terrible .
gas stations serve better coffee .
breakfast menu is terrible .
the breakfast seems more like buffet food .
sunset is dynamite , but not so much the food !
service started out ok but that went downhill as time went on .
another person at the table sent his food back because it arrived cold !
the filet that was ordered at the table was fabulous .
of meat ... ... this was a $ _num_ .
at no point did i raise my voice or ask anything inappropriate .
so i drove _num_ minutes down there and walked in at 1:30 .
he tells me try back next weekend .
i 'm standing there with everything .
the bottom line is , is he really does n't care .
i guess i will go to scottsdale to get these done .
he may know his stuff , but customer service sucks .
i 've been there before but never again .
this was not the case .
this is not a food bank or a church .
but come halloween and having fun , that seems a bit tacky and tasteless .
after more than _num_ hours i received a call from the owner .
we lost my _num_ year old mother to cancer last year .
i have lost all respect for mountain view funeral home .
normally i like shopping here but , today was my last visit .
one customer told him to stop being a dick .
he also stated there are bars on the building for bikes .
obviously i missed this area .
she is the only reason i am not rating this business _num_ stars .
she was completely rude .
my advice , take customer service lessons from your local jimmy john 's .
the employees did n't really seem to care about being there .
the whole sandwich was just gross .
only thing crazy about this place was the guy outside the front door .
the bread was soft and the sandwich was n't too bad .
ordered the barbecue beef sub and could not even finish it , so gross .
the meat was see thru , fatty and slimy .
not a lot of flavor except for salt .
way too much salt .
nasty .
there is a layer of dirt all over the walls and flooring .
it was just meh .
i wo n't be back .
horrible customer service !
never again will i risk my pets ' health to save a buck !
the clerk for the tow section was rude and did not give clear directions .
horrible experience !
just avoid this place , use anyone else .
zero stars .
bad business practices .
do not use i repeat do not use !
no answer to several attempts .
however they are incompetent and not straight forward .
told me it would take _num_ days .
first shop failed and second shop was fantastic .
very bad company to go to for anything !
incompetent !
it 's not too much to ask !
absolutely incompetent employees and management .
literally do n't expect them to be in business much longer .
terrible service .
literally about _num_ minutes away .
terrible !
it took about _num_ hours total which was anticipated .
the driver had the phone number and name of the vehicle owner .
therefore , no extra money was required .
horrible service , especially from matt in the office .
he was so rude and condescending .
_num_ hours to change my battery at the gas station .
he lost a _num_ '' bolt in my engine .
spent _num_ minutes looking for the bolt before he told me what happened .
_num_ hours .
i am extremely unhappy and can not believe that i was charged $ _num_ .
so when i called i was told they are _num_ minutes away .
my response was stuck on the east side parking lot .
its like playing taste bud russian roulette .
also , i have n't had many great experiences with the staff here .
have been shooting my whole life .
a couple weeks later we returned , knowing full well the rules .
i was totally shocked and felt seriously offended and embarrassed .
they are all full of crap .
i will never visit this place again .
made another visit over the weekend , the same awful experience .
_num_ is around the corner .
been over a month and have n't even received a courtesy email .
the facility itself is a _num_ star , the staff deserve a _num_ .
the .
however , this is the job you chose .
you are not the only game in town .
nazi douche bags run this place .
needless to say , one star is too many .
they scream and yell at people and have absolutely no respect for people .
idiots run this place , i will never return .
like $ _num_ to shoot if your not a member .
if you are a woman , forget it .
i 've never been to any place like this one .
the staff , save one lone individual , are atrocious .
shooting benches are a little close together .
owners are great but the food is very bland and average at best .
fun place for old people , food is n't special .
it was also pretty bland with no flavor .
it was n't too crisp and not too chewy .
service was slow .
1st pot of coffee i got was cold .
took _num_ minutes to get hot coffee .
ordered egg whites , sausage , home fries , buttermilk pancakes and grits .
after waiting everything was cold except the grits .
i had to wait for a complete do over .
prices i were too high for the portions they serve .
b rating on wall .
service was a little slow to begin with .
one of the pie plates was dirty with dry remains of previous customer .
if only i could give negative stars .
huge mistake .
steer clear of this late night disaster .
you ruined my life !
they need to lay off the ice .
is it worth _num_ bucks for a crappy meal ?
they now charge for debit card fee !
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
_num_ meals a side of biscuits and a cake .
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
horrible .
bad management if any here .
then all the breading fell off the chicken before we could eat .
very greasy and very sad .
horrible omg check out this leg ?
this has not had a bite out of it either !
it 's burger king , not morton 's steak house .
she was rude , she was nasty , and she smelled something awful !
a ) clearly did n't have enough training on a credit machine .
b ) she demanded , and i mean demanded another form of payment .
she would n't stop .
i was doing jobs like this at _num_ .
e ) the fries were cold .
i really blame management for this .
i am a _num_ second customer .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
do not go here if you are in any kind of hurry .
no exaggeration i have waited _num_ minutes with _num_ cars .
i 'm really not sure what the issue is .
we were delivered the completely wrong pizza .
absolutely no sauce , and no crust flavoring .
no , thanks .
this is my local pizza hut location .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
my orders are constantly wrong , or my food arrives smashed or old .
i 'm kinda frustrated and hungry at this point .
oil change does n't take this friggin long .
sorry not a happy customer .
i 'm going elsewhere .
no other customers .
we waited _num_ hours for them to fix one flat !
he was incredibly slow .
i regret having bought the tires from pep boys to begin with .
the set of _num_ tires were over $ _num_ .
their service is horrible .
go somewhere else where else you can be treated like a real customer .
she was not busy , just had a very bad attitude .
i wish there were negative stars for this pep boys store !
i was there this past saturday , april 9th .
sure enough , my a/c compressor is bad .
disappointing .
even hot it was not good .
the people we were with said their meal was ok but not great .
but the atmosphere inside was very sad .
she was not very friendly .
decent food , however , will not return .
customer service is horrible ... .
_num_ weeks go by and no follow up call or anything .
unbelievable .
day _num_ we had to call to inquire now what ?
only to be told to call chance ourselves .
wish yelp would start giving the option of half and quarter stars .
from the very beginning things started to go wrong .
no call no show .
i have never felt so unwelcome in a store before .
just a snooty , hurry up and leave .
rude staff should make themselves an appointment .
none of those reviews are inappropriate - they 're honest .
eh ... you might not be happy with what they have .
everything else was high-end brand names and too pricey .
now , i 've been trying to get in to see the doctor again .
i do n't know what 's going on .
it makes me sad .
he did n't care .
i spent _num_ dollars on glasses they said would fit and do n't .
nothing to like about this place .
the wait to be seen is always long and there is no waiting room .
only in it for the money .
mediocre at best when it comes to customer service !
however , it seemed impossible for him to show me my rental space .
in my opinion that is very poor customer service .
gave credit card # and got a confirmation # .
the room was supposed to be available to me today .
i have now spent _num_ hours on the phone , mostly on hold .
if i could give this place _num_ stars because i would .
he was short with me and plain out rude .
he let me in my storage and he just walked away .
you can wait in line to check out for _num_ min .
also their check-out process seems less than efficient .
for a dollar more order the new thin crust pizza .
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
this is the worst little caesars i 've been to .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
the girl waiting on customers is rude .
this place goes up in price every year with no input or options .
if you 're late it 's _num_ after the fifth of the month .
very poor customer service .
as of late , they have been completely lacking in the customer service end .
my latest visit left me quite displeased .
after pointing out the issue , i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes .
avoid this place if you can help it .
avoid at all costs .
spent _num_ minutes waiting for drive-thru order that was all wrong .
if you want a mystery order , try the drive-thru !
if i could rate this location negative stars i would .
unfortunately this location is very close to our home .
however , after numerous bad experiences we have decided to go elsewhere .
we waited another ohhhh maybe _num_ minutes before she came back .
needless to say , we will not be going back to this location .
this place is horrible !
tried talking to manager and she just was not understanding us .
she could n't understand we just wanted a refund .
they need to work on people skills as well as speed .
this location is terrible !
strongly do not recommend !
they obviously have very minimal experience .
will never do business with discount tire again .
this place sucks .
_num_ people just sitting around watching tv .
besides me there is only _num_ other customers & a staff of _num_ .
what 's wrong with this picture ?
also their chairs suck , only does lower back .
this place was horrible .
it was not removed like i asked .
a few hours later another chips as i am driving .
not even a full day .
and instantly they say no they will redo them and change the color .
they flat out said no and refused me .
so i got _num_ of my _num_ back in the end .
i thought now i know why those idiots were laughing about .
will not be coming back to this location .
customer service is nonexistent at this location .
i stopped by on a saturday , the store was not too busy .
an employee was helpful .
she explained they do not take them out very often .
she said she was off the next day .
no one would help me !
i tried to no avail .
she looked at me like i was annoying her .
will be back when my blood sugar levels are low .
this place is horrible .
they gave me an estimate for close to $ _num_ .
i will not be returning because they wanted to charge me for unnecessary repairs .
high turnover , poor facilities and regional manager not very helpful .
avoid if possible .
it was not as severe as the _num_ tooth opposite side .
it was just before _num_ christmas and i was in pain .
his assistant quoted me $ _num_ while on the phone with them .
i go to this referral _num_ days later .
assistant says , `` oh no `` this is just the initial visit !
they charged me over $ _num_ for this visit .
my tooth still has not been taken out after this unfortunate event .
very disappointed for the last two years .
would never come back to this park again .
gm wo n't even return calls !
yes , like rotten meat .
over priced on just about everything in stock .
or _num_ thin little steaks almost $ _num_ ?
no wonder this place is always so empty !
the store was incredibly empty .
after reading other reviews , it sounds like this pricing is common practice .
the photographer was about _num_ years old with no experience !
i would never use them again .
ordered $ _num_ dollars ' worth of pictures .
by december 9th , i still had not received my photos .
they are awful .
three weeks later , still no pictures .
half the staff did not know what was going on or were in training .
pictures were terrible quality .
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
why is n't there an option for no stars .
disappointed does n't even begin to describe how i feel .
ridiculous ...
i too wish i could give negative stars .
he did one class ( about _num_ kids ) in _num_ minutes .
if i could rate them a zero i would .
what horrible horrible service .
do n't bother being on time because they wo n't .
this place sucks .
mediocre `` bread store '' with much to be desired .
make no mistake ... bread basket does not make their own products !
there are stacked empty shelves by the door .
as for the food , it is expensive for what you get .
my side was dill potato salad and it tasted old and sour .
i think the potatoes may have been boiled a few days before .
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
never going back .
we stayed here _num_ days .
makes for a very uncomfortable shopping experience .
painful review for a painful experience .
a complete insult to italian cuisine .
the ciabatta bread was cold .
not $ _num_ more .
i would even beg to say the olive garden is tastier and cheaper .
i think their food is worth closer to $ _num_ per meal .
just lacking when you put into account the total of your bill .
like seriously , $ _num_ for fettuccine alfredo ?
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
but those two things alone would not convince me to go back .
ordered fettuccine alfredo and the sauce was completely separated .
i would not recommend this place .
there is better , cheaper italian food to be had in the valley .
wish we had followed the trend of the other diners and ordered pizza .
veal was mushy and the marinara was way too sweet .
drinks were sub par at best .
the pizza was very reminiscent of the midwest and made me think of home .
i thought the dough however was bland and seemed overworked .
all in all , i would n't make a special trip .
even when i was a kid i knew it was mediocre at best .
do n't try to trick us common mesa folk with your fancy italian .
ugh .
i got the berry and candied walnut salad .
the spring mix was old and it was nothing special .
service was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was mia quite a bit .
my family has been dinning at vito 's for about _num_ years .
in the past year i have had such bad pizza from vito 's .
because the pizza had changed , it was n't vito 's old pizza !
then my sister convinced me to try it one more time .
the pizza was a little better .
so tonight i thought i would give it another chance .
the quality is just not worth the price of the pizza any more .
judy n .
the pizza is horrible .
long story short , the pizza is nasty and definitely not thin crust .
this place just was not very good .
she seemed shy and had trouble talking to the table .
all in all , i do n't really want to ever return .
i just felt that the calamari was bland .
the roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty .
my wife and i did not enjoy the food or the experience .
the food was just bland and not unique .
it was n't a bad dish , it just was n't a good dish .
i hate iced tea without ice .
if all you want is pizza , this is the place .
the italian beef sandwich was pretty weak .
and the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my liking .
terrible pizza , tasted like it was from a box .
bread tasted like it was from a bag .
gave it a try twice , will not come back .
i ordered an individual pepperoni pizza , and a dozen wings .
i pulled out $ _num_ , and handed the driver $ _num_ .
he walked off , rather quickly .
i opened my bag to find zero ranch ... zero sauce .
driver scored almost a $ _num_ tip .
not cool .
what a disappointment ... no one can be trusted .
$ _num_ dollars for sauce , dough , cheese , and sausage ?
this was the worst service i have received in years .
over priced hole in the wall pizza joint .
not for us .
the food is mediocre at best .
the pasta was bland and the meat sauce - also bland .
but i wo n't be back .
the crust had no flavor .
it is cheap italian food , but friendly and fast .
the caesar salad was watery and not seasoned properly .
however , it was cold inside !
the only good thing was the bread and butter ... .
will not be going back .
used to go here all the time and noticed food was changing .
so we changed to another italian local place down the road .
hoping they change back to original chicken .
worst dining experience ever !
not from either of us , i and my guest have very close haircuts .
am on the fence as to whether or not i can ever return here .
absolute garbage .
my spaghetti and meatballs was pure garbage .
the spaghetti was stuck together like it was sitting out for hours .
i work too damn hard to be ripped off like this .
whoever prepared that meal or is running the kitchen should be gone .
this food is not very good .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
wo n't be back .
bland and basic .
this is not anything close to italian cuisine .
cute place but disappointing food .
i heard good things about this place , but was terribly disappointed .
it was n't working correctly and would n't let me enter my cc info .
wo n't be back .
another regular customer run off by the new manager , susan .
but this last time both check-in and check-out were rude and difficult .
when i arrived , susan said the shots were required .
she then left the desk and me standing there .
she said your bill is $ _num_ .
no more bark avenue for me .
but she will run off half the wonderful employees and all the regular customers .
not surprising .
i do n't feel the quality is in this place .
my nails could have been done way better by a salon school .
pain pills to sleep is the only way i could stop the burn .
do not have your eyebrows waxed at this establishment .
my first time here , i had an appointment .
i wo n't be back .
not usually a problem but she also kept stopping to talk to her friends .
the second she was done with the top coat she walked off .
i 've come _num_ times now and i wo n't be back .
they 've disappointed me every time .
very overpriced and i am rushed through it .
sorry you just lost my business .
pedicures are still of the same quality i like to get .
i will not let that female tech touch my nails again .
then when she did come , she was so rude .
wow -- what a poor business on customer service and follow-up !
terrible !
watch out if buying from this company .
i called david and he told me they could not guarantee a seamless install .
i am almost embarrassed to show people my new carpet .
it seems to be an installation problem to me .
we had carpet installed and sheet vinyl installed .
the vinyl came out ok the carpet on the other hand not so good .
i get that but these are extreme and i talked to him several times .
this experience is getting worse and worse .
i wanted a refund for the flooring and went through visa to get it .
then they offered us $ _num_ back .
some of the worst donuts i ever had .
bland and stale .
this was _num_ years ago .
worst customer service i 've ever had .
the atmosphere was very uncomfortable too .
so while their service sucked , the donuts looked pretty good .
crappy donuts .
i wish the owners read the reviews and fixed their employee issues .
hard and chewy ... it 's difficult to describe .
but the complete opposite of light and fluffy like they should be .
i wo n't be back .
avoid !
unfortunately it was n't a good one .
it was n't as good as i expected .
and couple keys would n't even stop ringing .
you do n't have warranty with me .
there 's still one key would n't stop ringing .
he did n't let me play and check either time after he finished .
just hurry left instead .
_num_ they claimed oil had been changed .
_num_ an electrical outlet inside coach was supposed to be fixed .
_num_ delivered with yellow check engine light on .
then why did n't they put some in ?
shady sales people and owners does n't care .
an employee here used my credit card info _num_ weeks after i left arizona .
avoid this store at all costs .
our home warranty company called this company to service our pool motor .
terrible experience .
do not use this service !
he just left without even speaking to us .
these guys are bad .
my filter literally has a leak shooting in the air .
do n't waste your time or money .
do not use even if your home warranty wants to send them !
should n't have .
the warranty company then refused to fix it .
never had them return any of our messages either .
if i could , i would give zero stars !
this company is terrible !
we used them only because it was who our home warranty company sent out .
left said he had to get approval and would be back .
another week later he replaced our filter .
later that day i sent in a money order .
do not use this company !
my warranty company got this company to come over and fix my pool plumbing .
if there was a way to give this company _num_ stars , i would .
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
as stated previously by many others , this company has horrible customer service .
they actually did more damage to our equipment than they fixed !
the warranty companies should think twice about sending these guys out on service calls .
avoid them if you can !
we stopped at the pumpkin patch for everyone to get a pumpkin .
it was awful .
i 've only been here to get gas , never to go inside .
every single time i shop there i leave annoyed by its workers .
it 's just ridiculous .
and how stupid am i for continuing to go back for so many years ?
which is stupid because money is money , right ?
rude staff .
place has really gone downhill since the `` move '' .
also , they charge ridiculous amounts for fat quarters .
it is n't going to happen .
buy them online and save , even after shipping .
spent hundreds here a month once upon a time .
the staff is rude .
it took me _num_ seconds to change it out myself in their parking lot .
do n't do business here if you 're a woman .
do n't let them sell you on work that they say will be needed .
i would give this place a _num_ 1/2 star rating .
would give _num_ stars if i could .
horrible customer service .
they do not stand behind their equipment .
will never use them again , would never recommend them .
call around , there are reputable providers out there .
worst sonic ever .
full of idiots .
this place has gone downhill since my last review .
such a shame as this place was right down the street for me .
to top it off , a bite was taken out of my sandwich .
this place is disgusting and i will never be back .
if it were up to me , i would give negative stars .
do n't ever come here , because i will never be back .
got nothing .
i do n't even know why i bother trying this one over and over .
without fail , every time i come here they take forever !
plus they messed up my drink this past time .
that may be an understatement though .
worst service ever .
the place is dirty and super slow and the employees literally do n't listen .
i 'm going to lead with ive never physically visited this venue .
they did n't do anything with the water heater .
i was first in line for the past _num_ to _num_ min .
i said no waiting to be seen .
so , john at red mountain was all over it .
so the baby and i ended up waiting an hour for the car .
you ever wait in a car repair place with a baby ?
my car would n't be ready until saturday .
they had not even called to see whether we were nearly there !
so only _num_ stars .
a major inconvenience was made even more inconvenient .
ok i had to go back and remove a star .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night .
the pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas .
the crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese .
$ _num_ for a very lousy pizza .
they were horrible .
they were dry and no sauce was included with the sticks .
very disappointed .
horrible dry and bad smelling burgers .
tried the angus deluxe as well as the grilled bbq chicken wrap .
sunday was my last time ever trying to eat here .
they ignored me and two other cars around half an hour before closing .
do n't eat inside .
overall would n't recommend .
poor customer service and food was cold .
everything i had from this taco bell had a lovely city of mesa aftertaste .
i mean really it is a taco bell .
the cashier here was very rude last time i went .
however i am still spending hard earned money .
literally every single time they leave out the onions .
it 's not brain surgery people !
i took my two dogs in _num_ days ago for grooming .
when i went and picked my dogs up , i was not happy .
in fact , i 'm considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau .
do not take your dogs here ; you will be sorry .
it was a very bad experience .
have your dog groomed by someone who loves dogs .
put your money back into your own local community .
i would absolutely not recommend shopping for anything at this store .
it should not be so difficult to get a store credit for a purchase .
-- but no more .
i would n't step inside this store again .
beware of their lack of customer service !
their water was worse then yellow .
i can bet you she was more then likely hurt too .
i have never been greeted with a smile or sent off with a goodbye .
only giving a one star because there 's no option for _num_ stars .
well when the food came i noticed that my chicken looked a little weird .
as i cut into the chicken it did n't cut like normal chicken .
needless to say we both could not eat it .
but something was definitely off .
she said they are out of burgers and bacon since it is sunday .
they were n't too bad .
i would have cooked them a tad more , myself .
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
my waitress brought out what turned out to be a sirloin steak .
the taste was not that of a rib-eye .
yes , it was a sirloin and would i like a rib-eye .
the manager was too young looking to me .
the waitress asked me if i would like something else .
big disappointment .
wo n't be back to another chilis .
i hate to do this but the place is soooo bad .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
the worst , though , was my sister 's salad .
no more cesar salad and now , no more potato skins .
even more reason not to return !
i will spare too much detail here .
showed up on time and did n't leave for _num_ minutes .
i will not order from this location again .
went last night and my wife and i are both sick .
we will not be back .
a few hours after i got home i felt awful .
the next morning it was coming out of both ends at the same time .
_num_ days later i 'm in the er still feeling awful .
( have n't been back since july ) .
woke up the next day with the same symptoms !
i 've missed days off from work because of you !
i had to give her one more try and same ol same ol .
the last three times we have been here the service has been terrible .
they are unable to control the thermostat so it is usually really cold .
every time since had been terrible .
but this one is n't worth going to .
worst chili 's ever .
no service .
worst experience ever .
terrible service .
waited _num_ minutes for them to even clean a dirty table .
waitress needs attitude check .
this was absolutely the worst restaurant salad i 've ever had .
almost zero other ingredients listed on the menu .
stone cold chicken that tasted two weeks old .
food comes out but waitress tells me the fries are still cooking .
the worst customer service ever .
took a blow dryer back with the receipt that was bought in july .
wo n't be going back there .
not even one star .
i drove all over the shopping center and did not see any sign whatsoever .
she is no longer afraid to go to school in the morning .
this place is a mess .
people were yelling in the kitchen and not cooking food .
the drive thru was backed up with no food going out .
the garage cans were overflowing and it was n't clean .
only come here if you have time to kill .
absolutely ridiculous .
total rip off !
how do you get rid of _num_ % fat and _num_ % calories ?
garbage .
i visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash .
unfortunately , everything was different , and in a bad way .
it was n't even the same recipes .
my dining partner 's omelet was n't anything to brag about either .
ugh .
i sat next the register .
but this was not the case that morning .
too expensive .
portions too small .
zero food quality .
wrong !
we smiled and politely said , `` no , not yet . ''
we will not be back .
we felt the wait staff was not just busy , they were quite lax .
from what we hear , this place is usually very busy .
the food was not great , matter of fact it was a bit disappointing .
it was not .
it was turkey lunch meat and the bread was stale .
and yes , the fries were awful .
tasted like elementary school food .
we did n't try the pie , which i hear is very good .
i will also say the wait staff was friendly , but a little slow .
and for sure ... do n't anyone order the turkey sandwich !
this is the 2nd time i 've been to this place .
first of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit .
the person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating .
now that we know the secret our experience should be much better .
we finally got our food after _num_ min and it was wrong .
after going through all of that the food was just ok .
after all the waiting and drama this place just is n't worth it .
the food here stinks !
understaffed leads to horrible service on a busy weekend morning .
i sent it back and they offered me some more toast or home fries .
no thanks .
_num_ for biscuits and gravy with toast and hash browns .
go somewhere else before your disappointed like i am .
we waited ten minutes and walked out .
i came here with a group of _num_ people for lunch .
the waitress did not come back for about _num_ min .
during this whole time , our waitress did not once come to our table .
no updates on the order , no apologies for the delay .
there was no apology at all during the whole visit .
i have never experienced such slow service before .
horrible service , poor food quality .
soup was salty , fish over cooked and waitress was horrible .
i ordered the country fried steak with eggs and country fries ( crispy ) .
order food came out bland and tasteless .
finally just paid and left to get out of there .
wo n't be back .
today was the first worst service that my friend and i have received .
first off , i arrived before my friend got there .
i sat down with her saying nothing to me of course .
then , i did n't pay it no mind .
it 's not too big of a deal .
we just noticed that we never got our beverages while we waited .
if they were new waitresses , they 'd get a pass .
i have had _num_ disappointing visits in a row .
reading the other reviews on here i see others feel the same way .
i came last week with _num_ of my friends .
only one other table was in there waiting for their food .
_num_ other tables had already eaten and were finishing up .
another table sat down beside us .
_num_ minutes passed by .
my side salad was served .
it was n't as if the _num_ waitresses were busy by all means .
i 'm sure that money never made it to the cash register .
i can go on and mention the other last _num_ bad experiences .
but i think i have expressed enough with what i have shared so far .
omg it took over _num_ minutes to get our food .
not sure if the guy was new or not .
but my order was completely wrong and not complete .
i was n't going to dare say anything .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
i was very disappointed with this cafe .
i will not be back .
excuse me ?
your website says nothing about this .
sadly disappointed .
very sad !
i recently visited while searching for a venue for a commitment ceremony and reception .
plus , price was a little less .
i do n't have this issue with other locations .
i will not shop here again .
this place is becoming one of the worst stores .
last couple of times i 've had nothing but problems .
if i have another bad experience here i will not be coming back .
i hate this wal-mart .
zero stars .
i 'm sick of this location .
this location sucks .
_num_ ) the staff at banfield gets a commission every time they upsell .
banfield would not send it .
$ _num_ for .
is n't that their job ?
ok , my dog is _num_ .
so , in comes the vet .
you have n't actually done anything !
- `` well , that would be $ _num_ for the office visit . ''
anyway , i think you get the point .
this place is a total scam .
we have been taken our cat to this place for almost two years .
spent over $ _num_ to get him well .
i decided to call banfield and they could get me right away .
avoid whenever possible .
like i am wasting their time by ordering .
they are lucky they have the convenience factor going for them .
avoid if possible .
i and _num_ coworkers went yesterday for lunch .
desert peaks has now been crossed off our list .
she was not attentive to our needs at all .
my fries were now cold .
his dough was not baked in the middle .
it was a horrible experience .
she was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average .
this is coming from someone that eats lunch out _num_ times a week .
i 've ordered carry out pizza at least a dozen times from this place .
i should have stayed away .
the gyro meal was terrible with no taste .
i do not recommend .
it 's just not a lunch spot .
if your a business owner looking for a new location please stop by .
this owner is quickly running this place into the ground .
the manager of this store is always grumpy and rude .
however , the next day , i was n't so thrilled .
but , just be careful .
the setting was sub par ... way sub par .
it just was n't good .
now i just avoid the place .
his food was edible , but mine was bad .
the food did n't strike me as being overly fresh .
the sushi combinations seemed very `` _num_ 's '' and outdated .
you could do worse , but you could also do a lot better .
this place made me so sick and i have an iron stomach for sushi .
the volcano roll was horrible .
tasted like old hot canned tuna fish with mayo and cream cheese .
also horrible service .
i came in specifically for the ginger mahi and they no longer offer it .
my friend ordered two sushi rolls that tasted fine but they fell apart .
i ordered the salmon that was drenched in teriyaki sauce , it was meh .
i 'm really disappointed .
it was flat , and had no flavor whatsoever .
we also ordered two rolls that had eel in them and they were bad !
i pushed them away and would n't let my husband eat them .
i 'm not going back again .
miso soup was very salty .
worst las vegas roll i 've ever had .
i did not get sick , it just was not good tasting .
it was around $ _num_ .
i gave the waitress my card and she comes back saying it was declined .
i was super embarrassed and dont carry any other type of payment .
she again told me to leave my phone as well .
not happening .
i paid my $ _num_ bill and left .
the place was packed and there was only one grill available .
oh it gets worse .
_num_ minutes later , the sushi arrives and is sub par .
the waitress says `` ill put it in a box to go '' .
at that point , i just wanted to go and never return .
walked in tonight hoping for sushi dinner for two .
horrible !
poor service - slow , confused , language barrier .
`` happy hour '' was extremely limited in terms of drink & food .
no sushi or sashimi on happy hour , only several rolls .
will not be back to got sushi .
i did n't like this place much .
the portions are ridiculously huge also ... and i mead ridiculous .
i do n't understand how this place got such rave reviews .
i was n't much of a fan of the atmosphere or the food .
the service was slow , but very friendly .
and it came with two whole pieces of chicken breast .
it was just too much food for one person .
the gourmet burger was pretty boring as well .
i would give this _num_ star if i could .
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
disappointing food , little high priced for what you get .
i do n't understand the line to get into this place .
the food is mediocre at best .
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
wow , what a disappointment .
the pizza was the equivalent of a bad frozen pie .
horrible .
do n't waste your time on pizza .
the cold air poured around the door , which made my adult daughter uncomfortable .
so , she said she would put a credit down under my name .
and he left to get the comp info .
he flat did n't care .
she was sad ... .
the waitress did n't come back !
she was busy chatting to other customers .
then she tried to serve us the wrong order .
slow , slow , slow .
very disappointing in the quality and flavor of the food .
our party ordered a variety of pizza , pasta , salads , steak .
flavoring for the dishes we had were all consistent in tasting bland .
up until tonight we ate here weekly .
no more !
maybe _num_ star was too high a rating come to think of it .
within minutes , the other _num_ people arrived with no where to sit .
i have been here a few times for work lunches .
so far , i have not been impressed .
it is very noisy and the food is just okay .
i do n't think it is bad , but not good .
sometimes the mashed potatoes tasted boxed and gross .
he does not seem warm and friendly at all .
he seems miserable .
he dropped off one of our plates and smelled of cigarettes .
the employee looked like they were going to cry .
it was uncomfortable .
very disappointed .
insanely rude staff , been eating here for over _num_ years .
never treated this badly .
we waited over _num_ minutes , a large inside booth opened and was empty .
apparently the booth was being held for another group that came after us .
extremely disappointing to be treated like this .
nicole has always been very rude and short .
too bad there are n't minus stars .
did n't care for it .
so much liquid poured out of the sandwich .
would n't make a special trip to go back though .
anyway , our food came out also fairly quickly .
unfortunately , he did not enjoy his dinner whatsoever .
our waitress also never checked on us once after our meals were served .
we most likely will not be back .
we just left this place and i can only say it was very disappointing .
no greeting .
no `` hi my name is ... '' .
no `` happy anniversary '' .
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
very disappointed .
nothing was bad for our visit , but nothing was great either .
i would say for the price point that it was uninspired .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
today drive thru is closed more than _num_ minutes early .
lines were long , staff was not friendly whatsoever .
very disappointed !
customer service is hit and miss with these guys .
which i was not expecting .
( shipped april 16th ) .
wo n't go again .
the inventory here sucks .
and the ones they have are horrible .
such a disappointment !
just disappointed in the product .
everywhere else in the store is hit or miss on customer service .
last week i went in with a new yard project .
i was pissed !
i saw a sale on wall cabinets and called to inquire .
there is nobody to take my call ?
i walked in and there was no greeter .
when i got to them there was not an employee to be found .
since nobody showed up in _num_ minutes , i decided to leave .
been wandering _num_ minutes and ca n't find help ... lowes here i come .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
... ... .
the woman at return was less than helpful .
both , essentially calling us liars .
if i could review zero stars i would .
i wanted the advertised deal as advertised , nothing more , nothing less .
he stated he would look into it and get back - never did .
hubby saw online that they were having a black friday in lawn and garden .
thought _num_ bags should do it - did n't .
i was disappointed when my meal did not come with sauces .
and when i asked for explanation , the girl was down right rude .
i will not go back there and posted this on facebook as well .
the dining area also appeared to be clean , for the most part .
my advice is to only go here for dessert .
walked in after dinner wanted a blizzard and a pepsi freeze .
still never took our order , said hi or even acknowledged us .
we will not be back .
just tried the chicken mozzarella sandwich .
disgusting !
never , never , never , never again .
this is the worst excuse for portion control ever .
i probably wo n't visit again .
the vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup i settled for was okay .
they also have half their sodas out of order every time .
rates were always less than $ _num_ in peak season and that included tax .
there were not that many people dining .
i told her i had been watching and not that many people were eating .
the fish was not even average in texture and taste .
wrong !
one piece of fish was so tough i could barely chew it .
what a lousy experience !
suffice it to say i wo n't be going back here !
poor customer service and the loss of a good tip !
i 'm sure it was n't a ribeye .
very disappointing .
i bought two steaks , four bacon wrapped jalapeos and two twice baked potatoes .
terrible customer service .
just left them on he checkout and proceeded to ring another customer up .
i had to get the cart from behind he and load my own groceries .
bashas has gone downhill .
employees are always rude .
very disappointing !
it ended up taking at least _num_ minutes .
he did not really seem to be to sympathetic .
got a basket with _num_ slices of bread ( slices of bread ?
meatballs did n't taste like they were made on site .
the dish was weak and lacked flavor .
unfortunately , it will be a while before i return .
from the more recent reviews nothing has changed .
what we did get was god aweful .
bread not toasted and not fresh .
while i am on bread , they are located next to a bread smith .
bread was not warmed and it was stale .
_num_ : my wife order was lost .
they did get it out about _num_ minutes after serving the rest of us .
_num_ : the food was almost warm .
at best it was a _num_ star .
said one cook quit and another had a death in the family .
seriously , sliced rye bread .
sauce was ok but should n't it be a marinara ?
strange , but they were n't horrible .
and the spinach , whoa , the spinach !
i kid you not , it was deep fried .
my sister ordered caesar salad , and the stuffed mushroom appetizer .
the mushrooms were stuffed with seafood and had a cream sauce and balsamic glaze .
, i would recommend this place .
if not , continue on your way and do n't look back .
terrible food , service and owner !
worst experience i have ever had in my life .
i would have been shocked to find out any different .
to my surprise i walk in the door , there was no line .
what a shame , need to clean house on that place .
a disappointed customer .
this location tends to have problems with the food .
ridiculous !
people are always standing out the door and waiting for food .
this staff is never prepared for the dinner rush .
this restaurant is always freezing cold and dirty .
only reason why we eat here is it is close to our house .
they tend to short scoop so you feel like you 're getting ripped off .
very inconsistent too .
i did n't smell it or taste it at all .
safe to say i did n't eat the sandwich .
the lady making the food was not interested in working that day .
the place was empty .
was she slammed just before we walked in ?
i will not visit this restaurant again .
i want to like port of subs because they are conveniently located .
i have been there _num_ times now and all i can say is yuck !
i wish i had a subway nearby .
apparently so .
and the sales person heather was professional and very courteous .
frank , the manager and now district manager was horrible to my mother .
delivery was late and after _num_ try 's with local store i called corporate .
very arrogant , could care less about anyone just his $ $ $ s .
3rd or 4th phone call got refund for late delivery .
such poor service .
we have had to return poorly pressed items multiple times .
unfortunately , they have issues with their laundry .
i also had some burn marks on my shirts .
it was a mess trying to deal with the owner .
it keeps getting worse !
they sure take your money quickly but that 's all they do .
the owner refuses to return calls and does n't care about customers at all !
i have n't seen a friendly face there in the last year .
maybe a little more time and effort into hiring .
poor customer service ... .
here 's the worst part ... .
cheap price with cheap quality .
poor customer service .
absolutely horrible customer service !
i do not recommend them !
massage envy is supposed to relax you ... .
not stress you out .
my biggest issue was how they handled billing .
i recently changed my card so they were n't charging me .
this store does not seem to be concerned about repeat business .
just sorry your out of luck , basically .
worst place ever .
you will not be able to cancel your membership once you sign up .
horrible company , dishonest pricing - do not hire .
i was at work , but my wife was home .
he said his total time would be no more than _num_ minutes .
after the job was completed , the invoice listed _num_ for labor .
why am i paying for two hours of work ?
no thanks .
because of that , i hired them to install my new dishwasher , .
from the beginning , i had difficulty with my hot water heater .
the water was just too hot even on vacation mode .
they came back and replaced parts , but it was still not right .
american said no .
the woman who answered said that jesse would call me back .
no call .
their customer service is sadly lacking .
talked and smoked with his co worker outside .
no more j & h plumbing for me .
i just got off church and i had my kids in the truck .
i rolled my window down and yelled at him .
so , i went in , to give them a second chance .
that i was not in or invited to join at this bike shop .
very unhappy !
the problem was with me .
disagree with me if you want , but do n't be arrogant about it .
this incident today just sealed it for me .
i took it back in , and the mechanic was very apologetic .
the bbq meals at the restaurants much better !
sorry , but if i see the truck again , i 'll pass by .
ordered the rib tip appetizers with hot bbq sauce .
rib tips were n't tips and were way too fatty and tough .
hot sauce was neither hot nor saucy .
at least the fries were fresh and did n't taste of yesterday 's oil .
stop in for some cold ac and have a drink .
do n't stop in for the food .
the bun on the pork sandwich was stale beyond belief .
the fried pickles were nothing to write home about .
the only decent thing we had were the curly fries .
just plain old nasty food !
only problem is , that even then the sandwiches were n't that tasty .
food was not worth returning for .
their chicken dinner meal looked like sliced cafeteria chicken .
the only thing good about tom bbq sandwich was the toasted bread .
plates and silverware were styrofoam and plastic .
the mac and cheese was and mashed potatoes and gravy was good .
very disappointed .
food was ok , service was bad .
ordered _num_ sandwiches to go .
just rude servers here .
i wo n't go back again .
this was my 2nd bad experience here .
big disappointment !
rude waitresses , slow service , unprofessional and dirty .
_num_ minutes later we ordered , _num_ minutes from that we ate !
the fries were soggy and the fish was bland and soggy .
we threw everything away after a couple of bites .
such a waste of money since it was so pricey .
i was not impressed , and did not care for their food .
for our sides we chose green beans , coleslaw , bbq beans .
secondly , the pulled pork was stringy , the texture was like hair meat !
dry brisket , good fries , not much else .
it tasted like it was boiled meat , not bbq .
wo n't be coming back here .
sorry i tried it .
nothing wrong with corn on the cob but how can you make that bad ?
i may give it another shot but probably not anytime soon .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
the service here is awful !
everytime its a huge disappointment and waist of money .
will not go back .
not satisfied .
wasting my time on my lunch break .
they were not very friendly about changing it either .
first off service was horrible !
the fries were so stale and cold that my appetite was lost completely .
old folks stuffing themselves everywhere .
it is just sad to see such a waste of prime real estate !
not busy for a s slow as it was .
plus this place is extremely overpriced .
find another place at the lake .
unfortunately , nothing else is .
i ordered the stuffed tomato , and husband ordered the bbq pork sandwich .
my stuffed tomato was n't a stuffed tomato .
it was thoroughly mediocre .
decor is very cheap .
the type of view provided and the cheesy decor was almost embarrassing .
this was one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've had !
so disappointed i will not come back here .
the people do n't care !
the spinach salad my wife had was simple and had pickled artichokes in it .
my taco salad was miserable .
do n't recommend this place .
service was very rude and their salads are not worth the price .
i do n't like to give bad reviews .
just wan na pre warn .
pricey for no quality , not even a little quality .
orange juice tasted like sunny d .
so basically tasted watered down .
even the water tasted horrible .
not even filtered .
no big deal i guess .
if was n't for the view i will not return .
ca n't go wrong with a beer .
i will stick to ordering nachos for every one .
i would say that the food here is nothing special .
i got the chicken wings which were about $ _num_ and a beer .
altogether the bill was $ _num_ .
paid for at the time of ordering .
no one ever called back to explain or apologize .
communication & customer service are obviously not something this company values ... at all .
i mean seriously , how hard it so to make a phone call ?
we trust home depot , so why not go with the guys they choose .
we also confirmed installation date , which was a little over two weeks way .
remodeling is n't easy .
it 's not quick .
this place is terrible .
staff is slow , not familiar with things .
beyond disappointed .
i 'd give this zero stars if i could .
there should n't be any rotten greens in a salad .
more black leaves then green leaves .
skip this place .
have been here before and the food was ok , smoothie better .
they do n't wear gloves here and the store was a complete mess .
on various visits , they have been out of straws , cups and soy .
seriously not good !
we ordered fruit smoothies thinking they would have real fruit in them .
terrible experience .
ruined a thanksgiving dinner that 's for sure .
the steaks were not cheap so we were very disappointed .
the beans were good and the cole slaw was ok .
i would definitely not go back .
my wife ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a small salad .
my beans were of the canned variety that they clearly just heat up .
not good beans .
waste of food .
they throw away what you ca n't finish .
no take away .
my sister 's four year old was also $ _num_ .
apparently , this does not include tickets for the dinner and the show .
the children were losing patience !
unfortunately , i did n't get to enjoy it .
i went there on mother 's day and the family style food was awful .
low quality pressed ham with a canned pineapple glaze .
dry bland potato wedges .
i felt really bad for suggesting we go there .
ribs were drenched in sauce ... way too much .
ham nothing to write home about .
you get plenty of food for he money but it is mediocre food .
horrible customer service !
not to mention he did not write down what we ordered the first time .
an hour passed , meanwhile people around us got their food within _num_ minutes .
finally we decide to ask , and after asking the server seemed confused .
_num_ times up to the service window for butter and once for more rolls .
this was by far the worst experience we have ever had .
service was terrible .
there was no offer to pay for cleaning .
what a disappointment !
the food was awful and freezing cold .
the entertainment was worse .
we were expecting to have the gold rush experience .
instead we all had a sugar rush instead .
the ribs were stringy and full of fat .
it was so bad we still had plenty left .
what a huge disappointment !
the green beans did n't taste fresh , much more like canned vegetables .
the cole slaw was n't bad , but was still too sweet .
it is as if sugar is the only spice that this restaurant knows .
very , very , very disappointing .
huge disappointment !
ate at family style restaurant expecting home made taste , far from that !
ham and ribs both poor quality and very bland tasting .
would n't mind paying price if food was worth it , but not .
will definitely not be back !
see why they cater to bus tours , probably only thing keeping them open !
i did fail to mention , the rolls were good .
everything about this place is disgusting !
everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not .
my wife and i ate there last night .
see my photos for proof , this ai n't no bs !
worker 's yelling at each other , dirty !
food was bland and cold .
avoid this dealership for service .
i placed three calls to the service department with no return calls .
obviously they are not in need of business .
then why didnt they work when we drove it off the lot ?
now the air doesnt work and they want _num_ to diagnose the problem .
so very disappointed !
needless to say i got the parts for under _num_ bucks and fixed myself .
and this is why trusting dealerships is hard .
as we walked away he said it was an honest mistake .
do n't get your keys made here - they never work .
_num_ different times this has happened .
not an exaggeration .
but i was left alone for _num_ minutes .
been here several times and been disappointed every time with their plant selection .
typical home depot .
friendly helpful staff , much more knowledgable than any lowe 's as usual .
can you say noisy and smelly ?
not a good place for kids .
maybe it was the horribly loud music ; maybe the surreal atmosphere .
the place smelled greasy and it was so loud we went outside to eat .
prices for the chicken was very reasonable .
this is just a just a hole .
yes , chicken was fried .
on a scale of _num_ through _num_ , i would give them a _num_ .
a _num_ hour _num_ minute wait with over _num_ hour between seeing the waitress .
food reasonable but extremely long wait with no explanation !
service and food not worth the wait .
wo n't be returning .
went and got my own drinks ( two times ) at outside bar .
( very long line there ) .
half of the chicken was cold .
all the fries were cold .
makes more sense to serve everyone happily then not .
very disappointed in my service and food today .
bad move as we were hungry and thirsty .
i ca n't understand why the wait staff is so surly .
must be an awful place to work .
they just brought it out in a to-go box with no explanation .
service was awful !
we were there for _num_ hours .
but the service sucks .
service quality have gone down prices have gone up .
however , the service , unfortunately , could not be any worse !
she had a too bad so sad attitude .
terrible service .
even though there was food left in all .
do n't waste your money or time here !
no music and very boring .
more of a snow bird or older person hang out .
female bartender was very rude .
will not go to again .
this place is not worth the time .
below average food , neighborhood bar atmosphere and service with attitude .
very disappointed .
but our most recent visit was very poor .
it appears the old management has left and started a different restaurant elsewhere .
those running it now have truly ruined the place .
the salsa was canned and the chips were bagged .
service was very poor and we were the only people in the place .
we tried this place based on the reviews and were very disappointed .
the staff was very friendly but the food was incredibly bland .
chicken was dry , beans were flavorless , as was the rice .
the incredibly stale chips do n't even begin to fill the void .
it 's apparently just a smoking area for the few existing patrons .
do n't waste your time here people .
the building is old and yuck .
the staff are not attentive .
i was disappointed that the menu was a limited menu because of the event .
nothing special .
this place is racist .
_num_ minutes later , still ignored .
not impressed .
waste of money .
_num_ month later its full again .
and wo n't help us out with this bad service they did for us .
would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with .
they were prompt at getting someone out to my house , thank you .
it very slowly went down .
this time the woman , was extremely rude .
there was obviously an issue that needed to be fixed .
after dealing with miss rude , someone showed up about an hour later .
he also argued with my _num_ year old neighbor about the entire situation !
what a shame , i like to stay with small local businesses when possible .
if i could give this a zero star i would .
they have a nyc attitude in a small quaint area .
i loved apache junction but would steer anyone away from this if i could .
no taste whatsoever , the mashed potatoes had to have been instant .
i would go here again even if someone else was buying - ish .
the beer in the plastic cups was cold .
servers were a little slow , but nice .
feeling ripped off and wo n't return .
yet , i go every year !
however , we were horrified that you had a vendor offering elephant rides .
the food was pretty gross .
the beer for $ _num_ was not outrageous .
it was also $ _num_ but tasted like cough syrup and threw it away .
it gets pretty busy in the afternoon so we left around 3pm .
the only excitement we experienced was getting in the car to go home .
like a sucker , i went .
i paid my $ _num_ to get in .
everyone was laughing and she had no idea that the joke was on her .
it was horrible .
all of the jokes were in bad taste .
and if you are female , you better believe they will .
or they simply do n't care ?
$ _num_ for an adult ticket gets you absolutely nothing .
the food booth offerings are terrible and overpriced .
it 's boring , dusty , and overcrowded .
did i mention that is was crowded ?
can we get our gas money back ?
not to mention the half naked women .
might return , but i doubt it .
the box office refused a refund .
it took over _num_ hours to travel from gilbert .
it was too crowded .
she was nice enough , but that is too crowded .
andrea had a horrible attitude from the start .
this woman lacked any expertise .
are you kidding me ?
i explained that the cake was pink .
she did n't offer anything to compensate for the error on her part .
i would stay away from this business unless you like to gamble .
checking back in to make sure people understand how horrible this vendor is .
it was thick , doughy and tasteless .
the decor is like a cafeteria .
patrons are very loud .
this is when it got very disappointing .
most were very bland while others were just bad .
the other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad .
overall , the place was really bad .
i did n't see a single korean there eating which is a bad sign .
worst korean food i 've ever eaten without question .
but yesterday i was thoroughly disappointed .
the fish was stale and gray .
i could have brought in fresher ginger .
horrible i say .
this was not bulgogi .
if you decide to go there and get disappointed , do n't blame me .
i hated this place .
i tried to go beyond that and ordered _num_ different dishes .
therefore , i 'm no expert on it 's taste , etc .
i felt this place as overpriced for the size of the portions .
the food did n't seem to be very fresh , but old .
on the side note , i noticed a lot of asian people in there .
ignored for a good _num_ minutes in a half empty restaurant .
_num_ % of service to _num_ % of the tables .
at least the food was n't as underwhelming as the service .
it sucks .
i ca n't deny the place did have an odor .
waited _num_ minutes for the check , .
worst yet , i had terrible diarrhea the next day .
service is horrible .
the decor of the restaurant could use a bit of a remodel .
korean food is mediocre for a restaurant stating its specialty in korean food .
but the second time was my final visit .
food was ok , bulgogi was a little too sweet .
could have used a little spice in it .
they kinda apologized , but not really .
the sushi had way too much rice , three times the normal .
the fish was not fresh and the mix of flavors were weird .
the gyoza dumplings were very greasy and had minimum filling .
overall , i would n't recommend the sushi here to my worst enemy .
this is a korean restaurant and they should stick to what they do best .
especially given the _num_ % gratuity they hit us with for a large group .
the sushi itself was extremely underwhelming .
the sushi was essentially a big rice roll with little to no fish .
all in all , i was not impressed .
update : sadly i will not be coming back here again .
but what we experienced was downright unacceptable .
really rude server .
trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare .
we probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a korean bbq joint .
tried the las vegas , tiger , rainbow and heart attack rolls .
like it had been sitting out a long time .
the customer service was terrible .
all three times was bad .
i looked around and there were still customers .
were not coming back here again !
do not drink the water , it 's bad .
but if you eat something spicy then you wo n't care .
service is terrible .
he did n't bring water for another _num_ min .
this is one of the worst spots to visit .
i will never return here simply because the service was that bad .
my family and i have been to this restaurant _num_ times .
the third time was the last time because our service was sooooo bad .
this place had the rudest customer service , it was horrible !
even charged us a gratuity for something the place did n't deserve !
the food and the service was horrible .
it was my first time , but was not impressed .
there are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it .
well , where do i begin ?
and for that i wish i could give it a zero !
this is the reason i will never go back .
the gentleman said they closed at 9:30 ... did n't seem right .
the pork was ok , not terrible .
this review gets _num_ stars instead of _num_ because she was friendly and nice .
for some reason today , was the worse experience i 've had here .
the server and was extremely rude .
this place is not the cleanest restaurant in town .
the floor was sticky when we walked into our booth .
we sat down and was greeted by the server .
this was our place to go for years and we were never disappointed .
we so wish that it could go back to the way it was .
my biggest problem with this place is that it is dirty .
sure , i guess you ca n't remember or write it down .
so i 'm out almost double of what we were supposed to pay .
they should have just refunded me back the cost of the plate .
i 'm really unsatisfied with this restaurant , but i still paid gratuity .
when we walked in it smelled like piss .
monday night , we were the only _num_ in the restaurant .
the place is old and looked dirty .
the money they charge obviously is n't going towards the restaurant .
seems dirty and staffs here are so rude to customers .
when i took a few bites of the rib , something tasted not right .
its gotten considerably worse .
the latest yelp reviews complained about poor service n rude wait staff .
we will not be going back .
bad service and food .
very disappointed in this place .
i used to really like eating here but not any longer .
you need to get your old chef back .
what a mistake .
i wish i can take back my $ _num_ and go elsewhere .
do n't get me started on how oily the las vegas roll was .
there were at least three servers and only ten tables .
was excited to go back last week .
sushi was terrible .
could n't eat most of it .
the chef did n't speak english and would just yell at us .
customer service could 've been better .
other than that , i have n't gone back because of the customer service .
needless to say i will never be returning here again .
it does n't simply make me want to walk into this restaurant to eat .
came in tonight with a party of ten .
food was mediocre , service was horrible !
food is mediocre , but mostly it 's the staff that ruins it .
forget asking to split checks , they refused to do it for us .
this place was not prepared for a party of five and up .
no water refill .
they are disorganized and the food was mediocre .
party of five and up , be prepared for _num_ % gratuity !
the price for bad service ... le sigh .
thumbs down !
this has got to be the worst apartment complex i 've ever lived in .
the list goes on .
and do n't be fooled by the gate .
this is not a gated community .
management is useless and rude .
_num_ days later we received a bill for $ _num_ for damaged carpets .
we tried to get answers , to no avail .
nothing was ever sent to the lawyer or us .
just stay away .
bad reviews , horrible service , etc .
well , if the shoe fits ... they were awful .
the management staff turned over quicker than a fast food joint .
it was a second floor unit , which was wrong .
a `` mandatory '' $ _num_ for some stupid trash service .
i 'm a _num_ ear old guy .
i can take my own trash out .
is n't that what rent is for ?
they never mentioned any of these fees upon walk through .
even when moving out , no one had a clue .
it 's a shady area with shady people and is no way luxury .
how can a company flat out not care about it 's people ?
do n't ever consider moving here .
this place is a complete joke .
i can not stress enough , do your research and look elsewhere .
pretty frustrating when they give you the run around .
there 's no way out of that contract .
_num_ word for this place - nope !
avoid at all costs .
do n't move here even if it 's free .
this place is awful !
this place is horrible .
the office employees are not very bright .
and that was with constant calling and going down to the office .
then they act like they ca n't be bothered with you or your problems .
i would not refer this apartment complex to anyone .
however i stayed on the bottom .
very annoying .
so after the move out we got a bill for $ _num_ .
but these office people do not have it together .
horrible experience .
i am experiencing horrible maintenance and front desk management support .
it is not acceptable .
2nd : its way too dark in night .
worst office support i have ever encountered
if i could leave a negative star review i would .
_num_ months later it still looks terrible .
she said that was n't good enough , so she called my husband .
_num_ months later .
not even an apology for the rudeness and mix up .
people living in this community have zero respect for one another .
that is not okay !
this place is a terrible place to live !
i can not wait until our lease is up to leave !
this is the worst place to live .
the front office staff is completely useless .
we have been waiting for them to fix our a/c for over a week .
our lease is almost up & i could n't be happier !
first time , stopped in for lunch .
he said the food could have been hotter temperature wise .
outside of the patio , not much to attract me to this place .
way overpriced for food that is mediocre .
recently i noticed that beginning with your second bowl of chips you are charged .
one comment in my group was `` this is chandler , not scottsdale !
i have also been experiencing mediocre service .
particularly since the place was relatively empty .
i do n't know why but chandler is really hurting for great mexican food .
considering that , this place rocks .
my favorite is the chicken mole .
you can not find that on most menus period and this is definitely authentic .
as noted , this is not a cheap mexican joint .
our waitress was awful .
the drinks too were just okay .
the real problem was with our bill .
for about _num_ of us , it came out to be $ _num_ .
ok , fine , but that 's not my friend 's fault .
he should have easily taken the $ _num_ off from our $ _num_ bill !
the food is ok but not anything to get excited about .
overpriced , small portions and very bland food .
the salsa was the only thing that had any flavor .
automatic _num_ % gratuity on parties of _num_ and more .
seriously , $ _num_ for _num_ corn tortilla enchiladas .
the rice was hard , the beans were dry .
a message that says , `` one complimentary refill of chips and salsa . ''
it 's just bad .
the food was downright bad .
the spices were bland .
i actually had better fajitas at baja fresh for half the price .
the only saving grace was the black beans .
service was slow , and the restaurant did n't seem too busy .
but not worth going back for .
i gave the restaurant _num_ stars .
service was painfully slow .
chips were greasy , salsa was bland ... .
no flavor , no heat .
i had to salt it just so i could taste it .
it then took another _num_ minutes to get fajitas to the table .
terrible .
worst service i ever had !
this place is absolutely horrible .
worst service ever .
also , food sucked .
it was a cold night so we opted to sit inside .
however , we were seated directly in front of the door to the patio .
a frequently used door by staff and patrons blowing cold air directly on us .
we ordered three dinners here tonight .
obviously , the beans and rice were eaten .
occasionally , some of the food is going to go bad ; it happens .
thumbs down .
food was mediocre but service was awful .
wo n't ever be going back there again .
my expectations were so low that my original review was to high !
everything else i 've tried was just `` okay '' including the salsa 's .
half the price .
not impressed with management .
we had just sat down _num_ min .
it is quite expensive .
at $ _num_ , i had expected more .
the food was mediocre .
for that price i was quite disappointed .
that being said their service is not that great .
i may have seen my server twice the whole time i was there .
i probably wo n't go there again due to the service .
guess they did n't want our business .
i just got totally ripped off .
never ever going back there , total crooks !
the worse place that i have done in the last _num_ years .
was empty but the dont care .
have been several times and service and food has gone down hill each time .
ordered steak fajitas and there was hardly any meat in them .
big disappointment
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
the service is horrible , the food is average and the prices are outrageous .
our server was one of the worst i have ever encountered .
huge mistake .
huge lack of customer service or wanting to make things right .
let 's just say they lost _num_ customers .
this place is maybe mediocre .
the food is n't that great especially for the price .
_num_ for two tiny cheese enchiladas .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
there are definitely better mexican food restaurants in chandler .
service was incredibly slow .
tacky .
but ... $ _num_ for a margarita at lunch time ?
i have so many choices of mexican restaurants in chandler .
i will not return here .
avoid this place like the plague !
horrible service , mediocre food , terrible management .
took _num_ hours to eat , and the experience was less than memorable .
not worth the money for the experience we had .
_num_ stars was only given for food .
service was bad to say the least .
would hate to see what a busy night would be .
the service , however , is horrible .
i ordered fajitas and they tasted very much like a `` chemical taste '' .
not impressed and i wo n't be going back there .
chips and salsa arrived promptly and our waitress introduced herself quickly .
this is where anything positive ends .
horrible service and just not very smart things happening around the restaurant .
this is the second time i have eaten her and i am not impressed .
no , sadly i had the same results .
the rest was very disappointing .
i ordered two shredded beef tacos and at first glance , they looked alright .
but what i bit into was not good at all .
food was good but server and bartender really were n't .
sign out front said try our skinny no sugar margarita .
terrible service .
mediocre food .
bad experience .
the manager could care less that we had an awful experience .
the service was poor .
i complained to the manager , he did nothing , not even an apology .
i would not recommend it .
she has tried following up via email & phone without a response .
the service was quite bad also .
our server asked two people to make our drinks .
i was hard pressed to pay full price for three tortillas on my fajitas .
why make fajitas that need more tortillas than comes with ?
surprisingly that was not enough either .
worst food , terribly expensive .
i will not return to your attempt of mexican food .
nice patio , fair drinks , overpriced bad bland food .
my husbands chicken was burnt , my carne asada was tough .
spending over $ _num_ , we expected higher quality food .
again , the place was n't overly busy , no excuse for delays .
it was very good , but not exactly worth the wait or poor service .
needless to say we did n't order dessert .
unfortunately , not the case for this place .
i probably will not be back since .
cares nothing for my feedback .
i could not make this up .
will not be back .
do not recommend which is too bad because we love supporting small local businesses .
aside from refills on drinks we did n't see our server the entire time .
when we did get the bill it was in one large bill .
and handed the incorrect bill back .
the manager did nothing to apologize for his servers terrible service either .
no one on the staff recognized the special occasion .
a _num_ % tip for horrible service !
are you kidding me ?
trust me go to macayos or garcia 's instead .
returned with our family & found the food to be horrible and over priced .
waiter returned shortly to inform us they were out of ice tea ?
no thanks !
shrimp appetizer arrived and looked and tasted like a boxed breaded oven baked shrimp .
let 's just say it was a complete disappointment when arrived .
so we ordered custom drinks both were poorly made .
they were watered down and lacked taste and substance .
they barely put any alcohol in them .
bad on us to skip the _num_ minute wait at san tan brewery .
in short , do n't waste you time .
for $ _num_ roughly per plate the food was very average .
lived in chandler for _num_ years so i 've dined here several times .
not sure why we could not get served today .
we prefer to patronize local businesses but you 've lost our business .
please fix the problem .
not bad not best ever , just ok .
nowhere near good enough food for the shitty service .
will not make 2nd trip here .
big mistake !
plus my corn tortillas were far from fresh !
honestly the worst carrot cake i 've ever had !
missed opportunity .
never been there ... scared away by the name .
this apartment complex is not luxurious in any way .
the majority of the office staff are rude and stuck up .
the upgraded apartments are not actually upgraded they just make it look that way .
the `` wood '' floors in the kitchen and bathroom are not real .
this is just an all around bad apartment leasing company .
such a terrible company .
honestly , a one star rating is even too much for this place .
the place was kinda busy , several people getting mani/pedi 's .
this chair sucked .
the top half did n't work and the water was cold .
it was barely warmer .
i 'll pay $ _num_ elsewhere .
worst pedicure of my life .
horrible !
painful !
had to use a laundromat since my washing machine broke down .
more then half the washing machines were out of order .
in addition the free wifi was not working .
now just a week later there are _num_ machines marked `` out of order !
now there are _num_ machines marked out of order !
i would n't recommend this business to anyone .
when we went to pick up the cushions , they were wrong .
no call .
_num_ month went by and they called to say cushions were ready .
when we went to pick them up , they were wrong again .
we gave patio star a set of the old cushions for sample and guide .
they neglected to advise us of that when ordering .
do n't believe their ads .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
or for free , out of a trash bin .
personally , i 'd rather skip a meal than go here .
mac an cheese was watery , chicken alfredo was blah .
nothing was `` bad '' it just was not good .
they gave me the run around for weeks .
they are not friendly , or helpful .
i 'm not a fan .
( this was not in the lease agreement ) .
this is a horribly run company and needs changes asap .
do not put yourself in this situation .
not worth it .
and the apartments are n't even that nice .
unfortunately you can not give a less than one star .
no way are we going to waste our time looking here .
this arby 's sucks .
one bad visit and then we waited a few months to try again .
it is one of the worst i 've been to .
the seats are small and uncomfortable .
you are forced to make your neighbors stand up to let you out .
pack _num_ adults into the venue and you can hardly breathe .
does not get much worse than this .
he walked me to the back of the shop and pointed it out .
this itself was very grimy and difficult to read .
also it was not readily visible to customers entering the premises .
yes it does get worse .
does not get much worse than this .
he walked me to the back of the shop and pointed it out .
this itself was very grimy and difficult to read .
also it was not readily visible to customers entering the premises .
do n't waste your time .
big mistake .
maybe something else is wrong . ''
the mechanic at joe 's failed to call me and let me know .
absolutely horrible service .
absolutely not acceptable .
avoid if at all possible .
however , this particular location does not ever have anything for vegetarians .
this is by far the worst panda express on this side of the country !
they are always out of at least _num_ entrees at any given time .
just go somewhere else unless you are desperate for chewy orange chicken .
i got half scoops of everything ( no meat in meat entrees ! )
terrible service and horrible servers .
worst location in arizona .
however this location is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
at that point it may not be considered `` fast food '' .
absolute garbage we went to grab a quick dinner the other night .
i ended up with food poisoning and missed work and vacation .
unfortunately , this establishment is the worst panda i have been to .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
this store is nasty .
the parking lot is horribly lit , very dirty .
just not this one .
however , this wal-mart has seen better days .
quality and selection seems to have gone way downhill .
this is not a complaint against just this particular walmart !
i put in my social security number and was refused .
turns out ... walmart will only cash checks for people with superior credit .
i will never step foot in walmart again !
and it still smells weird .
less like pee than it used to , but still not good .
terrible store lay out .
professionalism fail .
knowledge of medicine fail .
customer service fail .
not the best walmart around .
i only go for location but i 've been to plenty better .
wait times can be absolutely ridiculous even late at night .
messy .
do n't go here if you need anything .
i really feel this is the worst walmart i 've ever been in .
the store always seems dirty and the produce is always `` ugly '' .
i am willing to drive to the other locations just to avoid it .
this walmart is scum .
the cashiers are worthless .
i always use the self check out to avoid their workers .
i feel like i 'm in a foreign country walking in here .
been to this place _num_ times , this morning being the 3rd .
_num_ minutes for a couple of burritos ?
small portions and the price was almost _num_ bucks .
this is not a good price .
it all looks good , but again , the price is too high .
worst service .
someone at the table had a bean tostada it was mostly lettuce .
good food but the staff is so disorganized it 's not worth the trouble .
the crust was also very dry and a bit hard .
in fact , it had no flavor the sauce lacked any zip to it .
service was friendly and the restaraunt was very clean .
i could actually see the pizza base through the toppings , sauce and cheese .
it was a sloppy , wet , rubbery mess of a meal .
i am not looking for a huge improvement .
my husband and i ordered delivery tonight from venezia 's .
they also charged us $ _num_ for the honey , really ?
the carrots and celery package was pathetic .
but the customer service and pizza were better than most .
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
we will be going elsewhere for pizza from now on .
okay pizza , not crazy about the sauce on the pizza .
gal at the register was not very helpful while trying to place our order .
very disappointing .
this location could use some deep cleaning work all the staff behind the counter .
it has happened to me a total of nine times .
they burn their gluten free pizzas every single time .
it 's unfortunate that i 'll be buying my pizza elsewhere from now on .
we were very disappointed with our pizza .
disgusting !
our pizzas also arrived cold .
will not be going back here ever again .
much better pizza out there folks !
i will never order here again , what a waste of _num_ dollars .
i would give them zero stars i i could .
never again will i order from them .
worse customer service .
just about every single order we have put in for delivery has been wrong .
sitting here waiting for our food .
been _num_ minutes .
i know it 's late but spaghetti and meatballs ?
this place lost it .
i actually hated it .
the dough just was tasteless like cardboard .
the sauce did nothing for me .
i ca n't remember the last time i had pizza and disliked my meal .
because they only have pepsi .
yes ... super lame .
pizza : came piping hot but not made like they usually make them .
there was too much sauce and not much cheese .
i kid you not !
it 's mediocre here ... wo n't be going back .
just to be clear im the only other customer here right now .
extremely poor customer service .
thanks but no thanks .
not a fan of the crust though .
worst _num_ dollars ever spent .
would give zero stars if i possible .
horrible customer service .
phone clerk ( cesar ) was a a $ $ .
the pizza literally looked like what my leftovers looked like in college .
i did n't realize you could mess up a pizza .
cruise america completely ruined our vacation .
the rv was in very bad condition !
they sent out _num_ lady 's in an rv that was dangerous .
thanks cruise america for running our vacation and trying to kill us !
upon arrival we followed the instruction and attempted to connect to the house .
she told me `` it 's just not going to happen '' .
they are extremely unprofessional to deal with .
be really careful using cruise america .
the aggravation of dealing with their service folks is reason enough to shop elsewhere .
i was almost done placing my order online .
when they suddenly they do n't deliver anymore because they are closed .
so who do i call to get my money back .
no food no money .
he gave me the price & procedure for servicing the machine .
seems like a lack of truth in advertising .
tvs and other electronics were the same price as brand new .
this store does not have a large selection of items .
i was disappointed but decided to try someone else there .
i wo n't be back .
stay away from these folks .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
i like their spicy greasy chicken from time to time .
everything else though just does n't please the senses nor does the dirty tables .
horrible service !
these employees have no sense of priority , big period .
horrible service .
ca n't believe how rude they were .
i am pretty disappointed in this church 's chicken location .
i was not greeted .
the meal was only $ _num_ + tax .
she offered no apology and no compensation for my trouble .
this is unacceptable .
had to wait _num_ min to get chicken and old tasting side dishes .
this location has a real bad management issues - avoid this place !
this place has gone downhill since my first review .
sadly , the same surly , unfriendly people still work here .
she did n't even ask if we wanted regular -- just assumed .
horrible customer service .
kfc is just down the road .
the excuse for raw chicken was that they were `` in a hurry . ''
so i was unable to bring the chicken in to get my money back .
mexican girl refused to serve us as she stated she did n't have too .
this was my experience when i visited chandler valley urgent care .
urgent care says `` no .
he left the room and i 'm pretty sure he forgot about me .
no other patient in the place .
the billing department is a complete rip off .
this urgent care doesnt even deserve _num_ star !
horrible horrible place .
so rude !
a few hours after leaving here i was rushed to the er .
i wo n't be back .
their arrogant california attitude ruined this home to so many people .
i wish i could give this place zero stars !
when we arrived it was extremely busy .
however that was where our enjoyment ended .
there were still plenty of empty tables and no one in line to order .
however , that was n't the worst part .
they would have been much better if served fresh .
one of the worst dental experience of my life .
the hygienist was horrible !
she shrugged and said she would not do my work .
she took everything off me and sent me out .
i left in tears because i was n't able to get my teeth cleaned .
would n't a general cleaning be better than nothing at all ?
it was awful .
however my family and i are going elsewhere .
usually you get an `` i am sorry , is everything okay ? ''
but my point is that there was attitude and we we 're treated poorly .
beware , whatever you do , do not go to these scam artists !
if i could give zero stars i would .
worst dentist in the entire state of arizona .
i will not be back .
neither is sure of its authenticity .
actually i do n't really like it .
far too peppery .
to the brewery ?
it was so odd and very uncomfortable .
she was just rude the entire time and it was so strange .
she said , `` yes '' and walked away .
i 've also never left a poor tip either , until now .
i wo n't be going back .
annoying .
my mom ordered the margarita panini which was pretty good .
i ordered the tuna salad which was better than expected .
i would n't go back .
we went in and the place was cute and totally empty .
bye bye , brownie .
for the price , the wine is n't bad .
sure does n't say that anywhere either .
due to that little scam , i will not be going back .
terrible service !
the hostess said our waitress would be with us shortly .
she stated some one would be with us shortly .
we waited another _num_ minutes and no one waited on us .
the hostess did n't even apologize .
did n't even get a response .
guess they lost our business for good !
it is a little strange for a wine bar to be rushing people out .
and this is my _num_ time to the place .
my waiter was johnny and he was very attentive .
well , maybe they are but the food is not .
wrong !
and she walked off .
the wines are very mediocre , we actually liked the new mexican wines better .
needless to say , this place is definitely not recommended .
the whites are too sweet for me and the flavors are weird .
and we would have to provide the _num_ lbs of ice .
`` i do n't have to pick up the keg ! ''
sorry guys , that does n't cut it .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
a crap place passing off the italian food that they serve under normal days .
i never really get this angry about something .
do n't ever waste your time or hard earned money here !
to our disappointment this was a bad decision .
the food that was recommended by the staff was terrible .
i would not recommend this place for anything .
it is not a good one i am sorry to say .
however , apparently this is their m o .
disappointment was their closet friend !
this is not the way to run a business .
feels very tired and old .
probably should have done that first .
not a chance !
it did n't come out until the rest of our food .
it was so bad , it did n't even look like a sandwich .
that 's a _num_ yr old !
we really could n't eat much of it at all .
the waiter , who was nice , asked if we were all good .
i said `` no , this is horrible '' and asked for our check .
not as warm and friendly as i remember from _num_ months ago .
, the pieces would n't have come out soggy .
chicken was dry and it could have used flavor .
it 's like going to a micro brewery and asking for a miller lite .
i am so disappointed .
now this just makes me mad .
and while i thought the flavor was good , the execution was sloppy .
i do n't like to eat a meal that is not presented nicely .
the grilled shrimp one was not grilled or seasoned .
it was cold and rubbery .
ick .
it did not work well together at all .
but $ _num_ for a tiny little portion was irritating .
i think this is an awesome business model with poor management .
the food is terrible .
kitchen nightmares terrible .
there are way too many wine choices , some which are pretty gross .
also , this is the only place that will ship the wine for me .
however , it needs a shot in the arm .
the service was great but the food was a miss .
service was poor .
that was overpriced at _num_ and very mediocre .
waste of money .
poor wines selection to qualify this place as a wine bar .
enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere but the wine is not much to rave about .
i was excited to find another inexpensive mexican restaurant close to where i live .
if you like spicy food i 'd highly recommend trying the # _num_ .
i am sorry to have given them the chance they never deserved .
my husband and i keep trying to find `` the '' mexican place .
this was n't it .
it was just alright .
not worth it .
the place really needs a few coats of paint and some cleaning up .
this place is a stink hole !
stopped in today with my boyfriend and our _num_ year old .
sour cream and guac on the side .
i ordered the burro chimi style cause i like a crispy shell .
this was not the case .
and for $ _num_ , i could n't throw it away .
but i will never buy it again .
nothing terrible , pretty decent , i would of rather had the tacos .
he originally wanted a shredded beef burrito , sans beans .
they also do n't take credit or debit which is a huge pain .
the tacos were not that big .
skip it .
i told him that i will not pay three dollars extra for my meal .
the internet says they accept cards , as does yelp .
please know this is not correct .
do n't think we 'll be going back .
the breakfast burritos are not good at all .
the tortillas are paper thin and have zero flavor .
it just really is n't good mexican food .
awful service , mediocre food , and overpriced .
i am never going back to this place .
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
this guy , i 'm guessing the manager is rude and very unprofessional .
horrible customer service .
they had n't even started the order yet .
needless to say , we cancelled our order .
the driver was pleasant but the food was cold and the order was wrong .
every time it has been like trying to order from a monkey .
bacon and cheese was almost non existent .
maybe they were in too big of a hurry because it was very busy .
any delivery driver from this location , speak to your manger .
_num_ times i 've tired to get decent delivery .
no more .
you 've lost a big lunch business customer .
how disappointing .
skip the green chili burro .
this is a review for my stay back in july _num_ .
there were literally five cars parked on the far side of the hotel .
- the fitness center is really small and does n't have a water cooler .
it 's also lacking in terms of equipment and towels .
probably would n't pick this hotel for another stay .
the staff are very helpful .
the toilet in my room was leaking .
with every flush , i noticed water at the base of the toilet .
even in the room , i still could hear the music .
all the rooms are outside and it 's _num_ floors high .
oh well , it was only $ _num_ for a _num_ night stay .
a lady i work with had a similar experience with her room .
she did not like it .
only breakfast was average .
lunches were average to above average , and dinner was above average .
the meeting rooms themselves are old and tired .
levels were n't set properly .
it was n't worth it .
to think of all the money the team spent at that place !
however , on the day of my wedding nothing that was promised happened .
my wedding day memories will forever be sour .
ugh , this place is annoying .
absolutely ridiculous !
also , the beds were horrible !
the mattresses were hard and clearly old .
it was over a holiday weekend and the parking lot was practically empty .
the only pool complaint i have was from the last day of our stay .
i played on this course this last sunday and was so disappointed .
very sad .
rating the golf course , horrible !
went here for christmas brunch _num_ .
only a moderate selection of food .
some of it was cold ( eggs benedict ) .
no one came by to refill glasses until she again caught someone passing by .
cost , with gratuity was $ _num_ each .
was worth only $ _num_ .
we would have been better off with a lunch at one of the casinos .
if your open to driving _num_ minutes the hilton is a much better option .
the traditional style course and the $ _num_ price was nice .
there were no ball washers & no pictures of the fairways at each tee .
hence on one hole we did n't know which direction to hit the ball .
this is the worst golf course i 've ever played on .
there was no assistance with baggage or with assisting them to their room .
i wish i had n't .
then i made the hike to my room which was incredibly disappointing .
the whole place looks like a cheap apartment complex .
cheap buffet quality food for a much higher price .
the golf course is one of the worse i ever played .
stayed at this hotel because we were attending a swim meet across the street .
this is more like a standard motel _num_ that costs 3x the amount .
sad to see this course in this poor condition !
unfortunately , this is my home for the next _num_ 1/2 days .
first off , it is a hike to get to your room .
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
was a tube tv from the early _num_ 's .
downtown chandler was awesome as it was the first time in that area .
but the rooms are not so nice .
when i got to my room , my impression immediately changed .
then i went in my room and i thought someone was still staying there .
the housekeeping continued to be a problem though .
pool looks nothing like their site .
when it 's _num_ out , you 'd rather have a completely enclosed hotel .
the ac is extremely loud and hard to sleep with .
i have stayed here regularly for business for years .
the only positive are the close with walking distance bars and restaurants .
this is unacceptable !
horrible service !
not a resort !
no fridge , old crusty tub and floors .
i immediately started to cry lol !
very outdated and over all such a waste of time and money !
truly a terrible experience .
what did matter is the fact our air conditioning does n't work .
thinking of just getting a cab and heading back home .
what a waste .
do not stay here .
when did crown plaza put their names on sub par accommodations .
they failed to mention it until we seen the sign .
ice machine broken on our floor and our tv did not work .
no one called me back .
no one called me back .
it 's like going out on an expensive blind date .
elevator out of order for entire stay .
no microwave .
no fridge .
much too loud air conditioning units .
no valet .
i really want to like this hotel .
that 's where the positives stop .
there are several hotels nearby for less money and much nicer .
one had a sewer smell .
no hand soap or no shower soap .
you get one small bar per stay of either but not both .
* ) no comforter on bed .
* ) outside hallways with no path to lobby .
- no alarm clock in room .
but none was delivered .
week _num_ ) no tv !
for _num_ days , seriously ?
week _num_ ) why you ask ?
just figured i would tough it out .
only selected _num_ star because i had to .
first off -- very dirty .
no shower curtain either .
no shampoo or soap when i got there either .
all they could do was give me a $ _num_ discount .
not a surprise .
finally , i get to the room and the freaking toilet does n't flush .
this place is in need of a major makeover .
when i walked in it smelled musty and looked dated .
i went into my room and the disappointment continued .
the room smelled musty , was dated and felt kinda gross .
i was stuck there because i had paid through priceline .
that night , i could n't sleep due to the paper thin walls .
the next morning i went to the gym .
the cardio equipment is sufficient .
the dining room was dated and the food was disgusting .
the hotel itself gets zero stars .
the required resort fee is a joke .
i would not recommend nor would i return .
it was like they had given us a room someone was already staying in .
short story : _num_ star accommodations with _num_ star grounds and prices .
beyond that , it is very dated for the price .
it was worse than horrible .
worst presentation i ever saw it looked like they threw it on the tables .
went for desserts and it was all picked over and looked pathetic .
they were open from _num_ to _num_ , we had a _num_ o'clock reservation .
wish i would have read the other reviews before making reservations .
the only good thing about this place is that the wi-fi is free .
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
the property definitely need a make over , it looked so outdated .
boy was i wrong .
so i sent him an email that day .
this place is awful !
do n't waste your time !
i used to have a bashas next to my house which was great .
i was disappointed everytime i shopped at this bashas .
i know they were going through $ $ issues but this place was horrible .
the rest of the meat selection is also no good .
they rarely had items in stock that i was used to buying .
do not go anywhere near this shop with your vehicle .
i think i will give this place one more try before i pass completely .
i 've been here twice now and both times left disappointed .
i 'm sorry , but me thinks not .
we traveled two hours to see the vehicle only to be greatly disappointed .
the list goes on .
huge , huge disappointment for us .
i 'm currently _num_ months pregnant and expecting our second child .
but this is by far the worst shopping experience i 've ever had .
umm ... not $ _num_ !
i told him he never mentioned that the $ _num_ was a cash price .
i may be a girl , but i 'm not stupid !
these guys should not be in business .
i would not recommend purchasing a vehicle here .
lastly , this it the thing that bugs me the most .
i 've given this place _num_ chances .
i thought the tv was there to entertain the customers .
guess not .
so disappointed : ( .
we have been disappointed in their customer service .
they said they would check and call me back .
i was furious with the lack of customer service .
i 've never had a more terrible customer experience .
warning to everyone to do your research before doing business with this company .
they said they would check and call me back .
i was furious with the lack of customer service .
i 've never had a more terrible customer experience .
warning to everyone to do your research before doing business with this company .
you 're here for mass quantities , not subtle qualities .
when my food arrived , i quickly found out .
not much flavor and no texture or substance .
the coffee was average and the refills were not given in a timely manner .
there is no where inside for people to sit while waiting for a table .
chandler and gilbert have several places for breakfast that rock all over this place .
taking this into consideration , i would not eat at this place again .
do n't waste you time and money with this place .
i have no idea how they ever received a _num_ star rating .
john had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs .
usually blueberries in pancakes are the opposite .
the pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland .
so if you stop in i would stay away from the pancakes .
the first time i went it was n't bad .
however , the last time my husband and i went it was horrible .
we both were so disappointed with our meals we sent them back .
the coffee was also quite horrible , it tasted like dirty water .
i then ordered blueberry pancakes and my husband ordered blueberry waffles .
i really should have sent these back as well .
the blueberries tasted rotten .
needless to see we will never be returning here and wasting our money again !
service by waitress ruined the whole experience .
so disappointed in the way my family & i were treated .
service was slow .
i give it _num_ stars because the cost is low .
i do n't think i 've ever had a worst breakfast .
my wife had the chicken fried steak and potatoes ... same thing .
i also posted pictures but they too are gone .
i guess some people really have no idea what good food taste like .
the cheese used on the omelets is tasteless .
keep trying to figure out why it had no taste .
not sure why people rave about the biscuits and gravy .
this place was horrible !
just gross !
my husbands burger was flat out disgusting .
the chicken fried steak was average .
however the service was horrible .
maybe it was just the waitress we had but service this time was horrible .
this place was super disgusting before the remodel so we avoided .
also their chili is usually watered down .
obviously you would expect a little exaggeration , but that is misleading _num_ % .
luxurious is n't anywhere near this place .
warning : do not stay at this terrible hotel !
one star does n't nearly state it strongly enough .
the accommodations were so-so .
complained about bugs and lack of service in july .
tech was on vacation , so could n't get someone out until august .
i do n't know why i ever call in orders for this place .
every time i call in my order they always get it wrong .
on top of that , they completely forgot to make my cheese bread .
so now i 'm having to wait _num_ extra minutes .
he gave me a few extra sauces too .
at least one of them was trying to help a customer .
i only went there because of all the positive yelp reviews .
hopefully i just got them on a bad day and they have better service .
i will not be doing business with this company in the future .
bad customer service right there !
they had my tire size , where most shops did not .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
i then waited for another _num_ for my value meal .
door clearly says drive-thru open _num_ hours and lobby till midnight .
i do n't know why i keep coming back .
i only got _num_ thing i ordered .
out of _num_ combos , only _num_ was the one i actually ordered .
this place is awful .
very disappointed with my experiences here .
arrived rang the door bell once , waited _num_ minutes and rang it again .
waited about another _num_ mins and no one came out .
the place was n't even busy and i counted at least _num_ employees .
management really needs to figure this out .
they are better off taking the propane out since the service is none existent .
the boy behind the counter expected me to do it yourself .
if you are n't strong i do no recommend coming alone .
this is literally the worst mcdonald 's i have ever gone to .
only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning .
service here is slow .
manager was there but did n't seem to care .
avoid this place !
slow service .
i refuse to go to this mcdonald 's .
the soda and condiment station is completely dirty almost gross .
i wish there were negative stars .
_num_ mins .
later still nobody cleaned it up .
the store was not busy and there were at least _num_ employees around .
_num_ min .
kids have been caught throwing rocks at cars for play time .
again they spray and nothing has changed .
the worst part is they came into my apartment without us there .
how broad and generic is that .
do n't waste your money !
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
unfortunately i had a very bad experience .
wo n't be back unless i 'm returning what i bought .
worse customer service ever !
they were all white so maybe the whole store is racist ?
i 'd give this score a negative five stars if i could .
rude workers and they were not helpful at all .
i would not recommend this company .
the store was dirty and the workers were just standing around talking .
their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection .
consistently the worst line management in the grocery industry .
ive tried complaining to management but they totally do not care .
i selected the pacific bay clam chowder and took it home .
but that 's not why i 'm giving them one star .
i expected so much more from safeway and its employees .
i went for lunch with my husband .
my husband ordered pasta with tuscan meat sauce .
maybe last week when they sauteed it but now it was a soggy mess .
my husband says i need to yelp on my own time !
the second time - what the heck happened ?
everything was a salt bomb .
the problem is i have eaten here four times in two years .
the two times i had seafood with the pasta i got sick .
like almost food poisoning sick .
first of all the bread was old .
i could not take more than one bite .
not sure she was in the moment .
silverware was missing .
really hard chairs .
this was one weird meal .
it was our first time there with my fiance and the service was horrid .
no hello , have you been here before , welcome anything like that .
the food was great , but service ruined the night .
the decor was ok but very kitschy .
for what we had , it was totally overpriced .
i could imagine olive garden would be just as good .
my husband also ordered a bowl of minestrone .
never had minestrone with broccoli ( and peas ) .
he ate the lamb chops not the veggies .
the veggies were awful and strange .
my mother-in-law had the spaghetti alla carbonara .
no marsala flavor .
the check was brought over and we never saw the waitress again .
guess it was a good thing we paid cash and did n't need change .
but i was overall very disappointed in the food .
the only thing i liked , honestly , was the bread and the wine .
it was truly awful .
the closest thing is the new italian restaurant by chris bianco .
meatballs to die for !
i hate writing bad reviews , so i 'm being generous with two stars .
waited for _num_ minutes for them to get a table ready .
it appears there is no bus staff or management as well !
are you kidding me ?
in a restaurant of this caliber no coffee made ?
i tried but i just ca n't .
my daughter had the margarita pizza which again is not a margarita pizza .
that was not fresh mozzarella .
but this was definitely left at the table .
when i walked in i understood why .
the whole place looks dated and not that clean .
i 'm sorry , i really wanted to like this place .
he was gone for _num_ minutes .
no further service during this time .
at this point we were so frustrated that we decided to leave .
based on that time only , i would give this place a _num_ .
management is rude and obnoxious .
they also spread rumors about people .
the service is one of the worst i 've encountered .
the pizza with artichokes , sausage and prosciutto was so-so .
not impressed .
will not go back again .
but the service is awful .
there last thursday and waited _num_ minutes with no waiter .
service was mediocre .
the wifey and i shall never return .
but it 's just not working for me .
the cooks do n't really know what they 're doing either .
lasagna was a strange overly salty cheesy mess .
are you kidding me ?
why would you put all of that on the same pizza ?
and why the hell did i order it ?
i 've tried a couple other rather unremarkable dishes too .
i 'll try to find another italian place in the area .
oh , the prices are absurd for the entrees as well .
went for lunch at _num_ pm on a thursday .
had an iced tea that was horrible .
probably from a bottle or can , was not fresh brewed .
_num_ minutes we sat there waiting to give our order .
there were _num_ large tables that were getting ready to leave .
there was no excuse for the service .
we walked out and went down the street for lunch .
what was strange is that both servers were just wandering around the restaurant .
almost like they did n't want to serve us .
there were no other tables ordering and i find this just odd .
bad business practice for sure .
do not get the calamari .
it has no flavor and it is rubbery .
i was n't blown away by the food .
the service was bad .
every day she answers and gives whatever excuse she can think of .
so , we get to the appointment thirty minutes early .
game over , no more being nice .
later that afternoon her fever reached _num_ !
she ended up staying at carson 's children hospital for _num_ days .
my daughter was way to sick to have just an ear infection .
rude office staff !
i would highly recommend you find another doctor and practice for your pediatric needs .
so sad !
i called tire pros back and told them what i found .
the manager then said there was nothing they could do about it .
he got me set up and my car back really quick .
would not go back again they ca n't even fix alignment something so simple .
he finished two other hair cuts and then walked away .
we waited almost two hours and left with no hair cut .
this was the worst service ever , will not be back .
if i could do negative stars i would .
unfortunately , now it 's all different .
but it 's still open _num_ hours .
burritos are plain and full of grease .
the cheese enchiladas are gross .
i wonder if they changed owners , but i want the old way back !
the slowest subway i have ever visited .
took _num_ minutes to get one kid 's sandwich .
if there was a _num_ star option i would use it .
store needs better staffing to accommodate lunch hours .
went to use the restroom , there was no working light in the restroom .
i swear i used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots .
the food has just been disgusting the last _num_ times i went .
i will not be going back .
the grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it .
ick .
it 's not like he even had to walk there .
take the trash with you maybe ?
horrible dinner tonight .
this school is terrible !
do n't ever use them , they are incompetent .
he flat out lied to me .
i left telling him i would talk to his manager .
after leaving pep boys i drove to discount tires on chandler blvd .
i gave him a tip and left happy .
pep boys tries to rip you off .
my oil and tire rotation ( i had and appointment ) took _num_ hours .
and they did not do the full inspection of the rest of the vehicle .
the drivers door window would not work .
they lost me and my friends as customers .
it is officially where customer service died .
i made an appointment to have my car 's tires rotated and balanced .
i did not hear from them for two hours .
went to this location for years .
( brakes , oil change , tire rotation ) .
know your company policies and do n't inconvenience the customer !
thanks for nothing and continue to earn your low star rating .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced at any car shop .
i got my _num_ tires from them and paid for the extended guarantee plan .
i will never give this business another dollar ... .
a job that should have taken no more than _num_ min .
they ca n't possibly mess that up .
no tires .
they gave me absolutely no notice at all .
terrible customer service .
i rarely write negative reviews but this location is terrible .
will avoid in the future though i work nearby .
we were super disappointed in the service we received from them .
management ( scott & mike ) was not helpful .
ridiculous !
umm , no thank you !
steer far , far away from here !
i would skip it .
i lived there for almost _num_ years and it was horrible .
this place is a nightmare .
they are not good at signing for packages that are received .
ugh !
this place is _num_ years old and it shows in the inside apartment .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
stove , refrigerator are very old and not energy save .
_num_ ?
how convenient is it that the apartment does n't exist anymore .
they wo n't tell you though .
so , goes without saying : do n't .
i hired these guys to come install a mirror in my master bath .
so , he left knowing there was a problem .
the installer did not see this when he was done ?
_num_ months to get a show door installed .
_num_ times they came out and ordered the wrong things .
go somewhere else or you 'll regret it .
i made the mistake , do n't you .
do n't bother .
saved myself a few hundred dollars .
this was the same thing i found on my scan .
this entire process would have taken about _num_ minutes and _num_ seconds .
she said she would call back with an offer .
customer service : omg ... horrible .
ridiculous .
it 's not like i was renting for only a weekend .
i was wanting to rent for _num_ whole months .
how dishonest !
there are horrible .
the manager is horrible .
in _num_ mins .
they gave me $ _num_ off .
we just had a generally bad experience with this place .
this car was terrible .
it does n't seem safe at all .
this is a ridiculous fee considering it is almost _num_ days ' rental cost .
no one with enterprise was willing to help , even after explaining the situation .
it was just such a stupid process .
dont think i will rent from this location again .
there is better pizza around and closer .
i got a large _num_ topping hand tossed pizza .
crust was crappy , sauce was crappy , and toppings were ok but sparse .
i would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza .
i also got _num_ piece box of boneless chicken too .
that was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried .
these days , all pizza is not worth the money .
the only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food .
worse experience ever .
does n't even deserve one star .
all i ordered was two small one topping pizzas and pizza bites .
but it was n't , and i was n't .
never again will domino 's receive my patronage .
this is terrible , never had i had an issue this bad .
but do n't expect free crushed peppers they charge a extra cost .
even little cesar 's gives free crushed peppers .
unethical company that does not live up to thier word .
i did not move forward with scheduling the installation .
is this customer service ?
this place was nasty dirty ; machines filthy .
stay away & do n't waste your money !
this place is terrible , there 's no one here .
you get an annoying fax machine sound .
when i get home i 'm going online to file a formal complaint .
life 's too short to do business with crooks .
this place is not clean and no one cares apparently .
for pricing i 'll share : $ _num_ for jumbo washers , the largest .
slow service .
mediocre food .
not even close to being like serrano 's .
the hostess was not very polite or friendly and seemed a bit slow .
in any event , the booth she sat us at was filthy .
not only that , the cups were dirty and old .
it was your typical greasy spoon diner breakfasts .
both my husbands and my eggs were not seasoned whatsoever .
halloween is over and wont be happening for awhile .
i used to go here about _num_ yrs ago .
had a couple of bad experiences .
only _num_ other tables seated .
only thing that i ate was the milk .
my cousin and i walked in about 10am on a weekday .
there were a ton of empty tables .
after she appeared once she never came back .
service was slow and inattentive .
no jam or jelly was served with the toast .
my family has eaten here for as long as they 've been in business .
well first it 's not a biscuit .
i asked for over easy this is not hard to do !
why do you insist on sending me an overcooked egg ?
then why am i sending my eggs back ?
the service was horrible .
there was no one refilling water glasses .
unacceptable .
the food was not much better .
the scrambled eggs were burned and the omelets were undercooked .
they are very inconsistent with their quality of food .
but then there are the times where it just does n't come together .
to him it 's a sin to leave any bacon behind .
too bad the food is so limited and not too impressive .
saturday afternoon lunch ... none of the employees looked happy to be there .
i ordered the southwest chicken salad , which came with a mini quesadilla .
the water was bad .
not just bad awful !
not good , not bad , just fine .
the bacon was obviously pre-made and cold .
waited _num_ minutes for my french dip to arrive before walking out .
the dirty glasses and silverware did not help either .
terrible call .
_num_ minutes in we finally place our order .
we leave having eaten nothing .
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
how ridiculous .
- this horrible service was complimented with food that was not even that good .
very disappointed with everything .
terrible experience .
our greeting was less than friendly .
but no .
this is your fault .
a zero is appropriate here but is n't a choice .
our potato orders were cold .
rest of food was mediocre .
or am i wrong ?
my feelings are a little hurt .
nothing to write home about .
not going back .
food was not very good .
there was syrup on one of the chairs that my mother-in-law sat in .
i would not recommend eating here and will never be back .
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
the food was not much better .
it 's outdated like its food .
sorry never again .
we went for breakfast today and were very disappointed .
very disappointing .
the only thing that was good were my scrambled eggs .
my boyfriend got the french toast , said it was okay but cold .
but today was a whole different ball of wax !
i should have left .
gross !
if they contact me , i 'll try them again and redo this review .
if you 're reading this , i guess they have n't yet .
personally , i do n't think that should matter .
that was n't enough to stop me from getting this pizza again .
no problem with the food here , just the service .
i can only compare this pizza to one of cheap $ _num_ pizza places !
except my medium pepperoni pizza cost $ _num_ !
i would have been better off with a store bought pizza ... .
i think they are a little over priced .
overall i would try them again but not my first choice .
customer service totally horrible .
_num_ % tip ?
not on my receipt ( which i thankfully i kept . )
( we live _num_ miles away . )
the charge for my $ _num_ order is still on my card .
unless you want to pay for incompetence and no food pick another pizza place .
the bad : god , i fucking hate this joint .
( did i want a chicken parm with pasta ?
did i want the chicken parm sandwich ?
but honestly the food is n't that good .
apparently _num_ is n't the age to start working .
they do not take groupons .
i repeat , they do not take groupons .
this already threw me off .
the waitress also wanted to make it clear that they do not take groupons .
i 've never had a chicago style deep dish pizza before .
i 'm sorry , but never again .
we also ordered some mild wings that they said were the best wings ever .
the only upside was the beer was very reasonably priced for happy hour .
this would be expected when you drop $ _num_ for a pizza .
very disappointed !
no thanks come pick it up and keep it !
i 'm not sure what changed .
the wings were cold and super fatty !
virtually no meat .
there was no extra cheese .
the dough was like store bought .
we spent over _num_ today for just the _num_ of us .
it was the most unappealing unappetizing dinner we have ever had .
all the tvs were not working .
i will try to include photo of our pizza .
i ordered a chicken alfredo specialty pizza .
they said no problem .
i then asked to speak to the general manager and he was not available .
they did not seem to care one bit that they were losing a customer .
once we got home , the puppy started getting worse .
my older dog cleared up , but the puppy continued to cough .
i gave it to my puppy for _num_ days and her cough cleared up .
they would n't give me a quote over the phone for an exact procedure .
do not bring your pet here if you have another option .
no sides ?
i tried this place twice before the remodel and the food was not good .
i wo n't be going back .
not the best for family dining and man was it not worth it !
what kind of a place does n't take cc 's ?
disappointing to say the least .
food was below average and the lack of service and smiles really annoyed me .
it 's not bad , by any means .
do n't feel bad , buddy .
just is n't my bag , baby .
it is just that there are better .
so sour taste write off the bat ... then the prices .
food is mediocre at best .
the place was filthy , covered in a layer of dust .
i 'd give it one star , but that just feels mean .
this place is horrible .
depressing atmosphere , poor quality food , very small portions , but high prices .
no chips available on weekdays .
overpriced food and not that tasty .
food was not that great at all .
the prices were ridiculously high .
spent about _num_ dollars and was still hungry .
the food is over priced for the size of portion that is received .
also no chips and salsa except on friday and saturday night .
but the worst thing is the owner .
he is such a rude jerk .
overpriced , mediocre food and drinks .
staff is rude .
what may have once been shabby chic is now disgusting .
the food was barely edible .
ok ... not that good , not horrible .
portions were small , bean were a bit watery .
tortillas seemed store bought and fell apart while eating .
i will never call or step foot in this place .
none of his business !
the prices are ridiculous !
$ _num_ for one taco .
well , that was disappointing .
disappointing .
and for the prices we paid , it was not good enough .
first of all there is no table service .
i ordered two tacos , which they charge $ _num_ each for .
my date 's burrito was about $ _num_ .
_num_ minutes later ... .
i should mention the food i guess ... .
this place gives mexico a bad name .
i do n't get it .
very unprofessional , i do not recommend this place .
this place is a train wreck .
however , while the food is decent enough , it 's overpriced .
the fact that they charge for using a credit card is also absolutely ridiculous .
disappointing .
walked in around 2pm for a late lunch and drinks on a saturday .
and an extra $ _num_ for using a credit card ?
probably wo n't come back .
i wish i could write a better review but ca n't .
guacamole extra but this can be expected .
plus they charge over $ _num_ for debit and credit .
no wonder he hardly had customers and they closed down the other two shops .
food was ok but i felt cheated and wo n't go again .
horrible .
food overpriced , no service , dark dingy atmosphere .
the only good thing about it is the location .
far too expensive for such small portions and mediocre food .
i would say they earned their _num_ rating .
get a credit card machine , its almost _num_ .
glad to hear they are closed .
really had bad impression from first contact just from the rudeness on phone .
terrible company to refer to .
there was no empathy at all .
unbelievable how rude this man was .
no water was running over the cooler pad .
i shut off the water to the cooler and turned off the cooler itself .
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .
the bill for the prior period was $ _num_ .
the difference is _num_ .
the owner offered to provide a no charge maintenance service in the future .
this outcome is , however , unacceptable .
extremely rude and inconsiderate .
basic courtesy and customer service is not in their business model .
up until the last year , i rarely had a bad experience .
that did no good .
ai n't no way lol .
this management now is horrible .
update : everything is getting better around here .
it 's very quite and people keep to themselves .
recently , they have done some remodeling in some of the apartments .
do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs .
it is not worth whatever savings you think you may get .
the maintenance is a joke .
the staff is awful .
management is even worse .
there is an employee named melissa who flat out lies to your face .
from the beginning the maintenance has been a complete nightmare .
was told we were moving into a newly remodeled apartment ... not true .
no one even called me .
tuesday we came home to no work being done on the shower .
not sure how long that will take .
i am stuck here until the end of november .
things from our move in list are still not fixed over _num_ months later .
i have never had such a horrible time with an apartment complex .
we had to call the police twice this week as well for noise problems .
happened to me personally _num_ times .
problems dragged on for _num_ months before the bike is finally working again .
finally i walked out , not happy .
update as of august , _num_ .
because of this treatment , i will never buy another bmw product .
bmw na does n't care .
bmw is the worst product i have ever purchased .
it should have been plenty of time to check the bike in .
posted hours are `` close at _num_ pm . ''
you do n't close early because you feel like it .
not true .
he did n't know anything about the website and did n't care .
so ... fix your website to reflect the correct hours .
and ... posted hours are not a suggestion , they 're your working hours .
i wo n't make that drive again .
the pieces then fall into the engine which has to be pulled .
this is to bad that this is how they treat thier customers .
please do not buy here , lots of headaches and waste of time .
extremely disappointed .
poor experience .
absurd fees .
poor communication .
ick .
my husband 's order was n't much better .
the egg rolls were pretty good , i 'll admit .
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
we only go here if absolutely , positively ... necessary .
i do not want to come back here .
strangely rude .
the main dish was soggy and salty .
the fried rice was not fried rice .
not acceptable if you have the same standards i have .
terrible .
orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze .
kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice .
i did n't finish my egg roll .
will not go back .
this place is horrible .
was the food just sitting out before they brought it over ?
the meat was really chewy and the vegetables were mushy .
everything was way too salty .
the egg drop soup literally just tasted like salt water .
out of the _num_ people at the house nobody could eat the food .
we ended up throwing it out and ordering pizza .
this last order , we threw most of it away .
i do not recommend this restaurant .
never get my online order in less than an hour .
very disappointed !
i ordered chicken and broccoli and it taste just like fish .
the egg rolls were burnt , tasted like they had been refried .
delivery was quick but the crab puffs horrible , nothing inside .
the rice bland , egg roll tasted funny and was burnt .
only good thing was sesame chicken .
never ordering again .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the place was a major fail .
their excuse for that was they were getting it repaired soon !
it had zero flavor period .
next our orange chicken came out about ten minutes later and it was disgusting .
folks , be warned that this place is terrible !
it 's to bad that yelp does not offer a minus _num_ star .
food is fine but the service is not even reach average .
foods are so so and the service is horrible .
it then takes turn to server other items .
some people came _num_ minutes behind us was getting their foods before our noodle .
that 's just ridiculous .
worst chinese food i have ever had .
chicken wings were chewy .
the sesame chicken was all batter .
the fried rice tasted like it was weeks old .
should be known ahead of time that they wo n't honor coupons .
that 's ridiculous .
i wanted to give zero stars but i could n't .
after this third visit , we will not be returning !
house of trash .
plain and simple .
just came from there not even _num_ minutes ago .
will not be going back .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
which is my fault .
guess i should 've asked .
does anyone know what `` chow fun '' is ?
none of the people behind the cash register could tell me what anything was .
chances are , anything you order there , will be a surprise .
i would seriously give zero if there 's `` zero star '' this option .
excuse me ?
apparently , he does n't feel sorry for inconvenience .
well customers should n't be told and ordered in this way .
the food was bland and cold .
they staff was overwhelmed and inexperienced .
i could only say , `` oh , really ?
`` in surprise and disappointment , darn it !
no biggie , i thought , i 'll come back another day .
i responded , `` ah , what time is it ?
i ca n't review the food as we never had any .
we waited _num_ mins for a table - which was totally ok !
when we were sat , no one helped us .
we had to wait for a table maybe _num_ min .
the service was very bad .
but not good enough for me to go back .
would not eat here again .
the fried rice was bland and not as flavorful as i was expecting .
terrible service .
they are not american chinese food and really delicious .
however , the service is not good .
hire more waiters .
my husband ordered a vegetable stir fry .
the noodle dish had some vegetables and pork .
the pork tasted salty and looked like it came from a can .
very slow service .
i could n't properly order !
and there was no egg rolls or crab puffs !
worst service of my life !
i 've been to almost every chinese restaurant in the valley and wow !
i attempted to return the item the server said they do n't take returns .
the braised beef was extremely chewy .
very disappointed .
obviously poor planning that does n't change .
if i hand thumbs for fingers i 'd give it a _num_ thumbs down !
very disappointed .
the big plate chicken way too dry like cooked overnight .
sour plum juice not good as before .
overall , very disappointed .
the english name of this restaurant is an old one .
but if you love noodle , do n't miss this place !
please notice the other reviews are outdated .
i went this morning to wash my own car .
after one attempt i figure lets use visa .
do not waste your time like i have done .
the only issue i had was with the dryer .
but its cheap .
the customer service sucks .
horrible customer service .
i think management really needs to work on their employees customer service skills .
yet ... upon occasion , i still eat there .
probably not worth it .
ridiculous !
had the honey hot wings , it was n't bad , just mediocre .
meh , i 've experienced better indeed sums it up .
i almost think it 's a race thing , i 'm white .
i 'm not really impressed with the location .
the burger was cold , fries lukewarm .
the other burger is cold and the nachos are wrong .
very poor service !
horrible service .
however , the last time we came , the wings were horrible .
not worth it .
the burger was small and very thin .
the hot wings were week , not hot .
not satisfied at all .
no courtesy words , have to beg to get the table wiped off .
zero stars in my book !
did he go to the wrong apartment ?
could he not get through the security gate ?
incredibly arrogant person if you ask me .
just not sure what jim had done .
and know apology from you , the owner , shame on you !
being a busy professional my vacation time is extremely valuable and limited .
at this point i knew i was in trouble .
i told him this was absolutely unacceptable and they had lost my business .
terrible customer service .
friday comes around , _num_ am .
he comes in , i explain what i am looking for .
again , she brushed me off .
this is by far the worst place i have ever been to !
at this point i was so confused !
the staff is cold .
i waited _num_ minutes past my appointment time to see her assistant .
did i mention the other plumber charged about _num_ % less ?
_num_ % cheaper and four days sooner !
horrible company .
their technicians are incompetent and dishonest .
bottom line , they can not be trusted for accurate or competent work .
i was extremely disappointed .
the staff was unfriendly to downright rude .
the inside was seedy , but not in a fun , dive bar way .
they also did n't look happy to be there .
big mistake , it could of been the beginning of a horror movie .
the staff is rude and not helpful .
no oil on the lanes .
the staff in general were friendly however .
if you care about your score , avoid this place .
is customer service completely lost ?
would n't go back .
the manager ran my credit card and gave me a receipt .
they have lost a good customer .
the beer here is super water down .
this is not excellent customer service .
service is terrible .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
no smiling at all and that was bad .
as with most fast food joints , this mcdonalds is hit or miss .
the most common problem i 've had here is getting sauce for my nuggets .
i really hate those establishments that hire people who can not speak english .
so i said fries with only one of them .
this is n't the first time .
i do n't think i 've ever had a decent experience at this location .
the employees are so so bad .
lol why do white people use yelp ?
y'all just complain just like every other american .
filthy , filthy , filthy place .
the dinning area had trash all over the place .
all around just gross would never come here again .
the do not honor the firestone warranty .
not a big fan .
hubby went here to get our car inspected .
the mechanic tried to pressure my hubby into doing the repairs at their shop .
the _num_ rear tires have normal wear , they are now on the front .
they did nothing to help me , except put blame on me .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i took my car into this place to get a brake inspection .
how dare he say a customer is wrong !
service left something to be desired .
i think i will stick to the nicer area starbucks from now on .
slowest place on earth .
_num_ people standing doing nothing while one person makes drinks .
was n't greeted when i walked in .
not acknowledged when standing at the counter .
no , not yet .
we anyway seems starbucks has done away with ordering beans by the weight .
the young lady was very helpful explaining the change .
friday i spoke to a woman on the phone who was very helpful .
they had already closed .
it 's a shame .
whenever i visit this location my ice cream is always runny and melted .
it took me less than _num_ min .
this locations sucks .
never had problems there .
on my last visit here , i ordered a chocolate dipped waffle cone .
simply because of the rude employees .
if you hate helping customers so much , quit your job !
bad bad bad .
awful place .
i would not recommend coming here .
it 's in a bad location in chandler .
long wait and the quality is not good .
place is dirty and stinky .
this is the worst dq .
the worst .
estimated _num_ % chance your order will be wrong in some way .
approximately _num_ % chance the service will leave something to be desired .
the place has no air conditioning , the service was awful .
the place is dirty and smells bad , the employees are n't even clean .
worst dq i 've ever been to .
dirty , horribly slow service ... and say what ?
somebody needs to rescue this dq .
all rooms were dark and dingy .
the floors were dirty and the carpet old .
i went over all the details over the phone in making the appt .
i had been warned and i did n't even know it .
and , i needed to get to work .
i paid my $ _num_ and i left with my baby .
this animal hospital is just terrible .
they said they just never checked there .
the total bill for those procedures will run more than $ _num_ dollars .
so we probably had paid more than $ _num_ dollars in vet bills here .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
these people are n't for the animals , they 're just after the money !
no that was n't the case .
i had to wait about _num_ minutes and dr. christina shows up .
she checked my cat and then gave her the shot .
not on the invoice nor from `` mary . ''
all they want is your hard earned cash .
you 're better off going to the vet down the street .
i am so disappointed .
when i said no , they booked an appointment for a quote .
well _num_ days later he died !
how disappointing .
i have taken my two dogs here for grooming four or five times .
absolutely would not recommend this clinic if you care for your animals .
first , the whole place gives off a sketchy vibe .
front desk can do only screaming and yelling after that hung up .
i will not be returning .
never shopping at a radio shack again !
did n't need a refund , just replacement .
my options were stupid .
option _num_ .
or option _num_ .
unfortunately , i did .
i was hosting a baby shower and ordered food from roberts .
customer service is poor .
then i notice that i only have half my order of grape leaves .
by that time my guests knew there was an issue with the food .
yo , ho , yo , ho a greasy life for me !
to me this is by far the worst part about this place .
most everything is frozen , processed and covered in batter .
the food is unhealthy , deep fried and cheap .
the food is unhealthy , deep fried and cheap .
the worst fish & chips ever !
do not eat at this place .
for the quality of the food , it 's way over priced .
i wo n't even eat there for free .
everything taste frozen and nasty .
i ca n't believe this place is in business .
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
we tried the fish , shrimp , crab , fries .
got the fried shrimp , chicken nuggets , fries and onion rings .
the chicken nuggets were processed chicken and mediocre at best .
really , really disappointed .
nasty !
i do not think it was real shrimp .
french fries were barely cooked dripping with oil and soggy .
had we not gone through drive through i would not have accepted the food .
it was the worst fried food i ever tasted .
and the food made me sick as a dog .
do n't waste your time or money you will be very disappointed .
poor quality food !
first thing to know is they only take cash .
sadly the fries were n't much better as they were soggy .
gag !
my bad for going there .
yep never again .
once we got here and realized it was n't it was too late .
the fish was terrible .
fist clue should have been that the fish was in a perfect square !
( processed all the way ) .
everything was bland and fries were undercooked .
just no .
you 'd be better off buying a box of fish sticks .
shrimp was okay and the fries were good too .
it 's not bad at all .
got tired of wasting my lunch hour so i just left !
i 'm seriously dropping dana tire big time !
additionally , my tires were significantly out of balance .
big mistake !
big rip off !
tiny crap store .
_num_ bucks for a six pack at this shit hole ?
tacos al pastor ?
see my list for mexican food recommendations .
this gave us time to peruse the menu and decide on a combo plate .
not what i expected from the reviews and not satisfying .
you did n't know there was artificial cheese out there ?
fake cheese is really sold !
i have n't been back since , and have n't missed it .
my family and i ate lunch here for the first and last time .
the beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup .
the burros were alright but i 've had much better .
the service was pretty bad to , really slow .
i do n't see the big deal with this place .
the `` strips '' are frickin chips with shredded cheese .
carne asada burrito was okay , but nothing outstanding .
on this trip we were very disappointed with the apparent changes .
it was overly greasy and poorly prepared .
i do n't get it .
i got a chicken , carne asada and fish taco .
i did n't care for the carne asada or the fish .
the food seems to be getting less tasty each time i come here .
the staff however is some of the worst ever .
not a huge helping , one of those small condiment to go containers .
the beans were very greasy but hey this is n't health food right ?
tortilla was falling apart and super crispy .
not my thing .
i got eggs , bacon , potatoes , cheese and beans my norm .
i should have just got my norm bowl of cereal .
and the cook gave me a mean look .
i really do n't know why this place gets so many good reviews .
it is very dirty .
it gets busy and the service is horribly slow .
and honestly the food is just greasy and nasty .
but it 's not even cheap .
the salsa is not fresh .
they put package shredded cheese on and not melted .
i had a taco salad and i could n't even finish eating it .
_num_ ) not inexpensive .
_num_ ) not delicious .
i would 've done better to have gone to taco bell .
but i just ca n't eat here again .
and $ _num_ for chips and guacamole ?
unless you go to chandler high , skip this place .
the meat was pretty dry .
nothing special .
it was ok , but not great .
overall i just was n't impressed .
probably wo n't go back .
i was not upset about this fact .
not just cold , but frozen .
but the fact that it was frozen makes me skeptical on going back again .
i 'm getting really tired of going to restaurants and being treated like dirt .
she would n't even look at me and quickly left .
crossed off the list for good .
the burrito was not very good either .
nonsense !
was n't too excited about it .
did n't wow me at all .
nothing special about this food at all .
i ordered the bean and cheese burrito and _num_ tacos .
maybe people just are n't used to great mexican food in az .
i highly suggest you stay away from this place !
trust but verify , i guess .
indian tacos were over fried and tasted like oil .
okay , i would n't go that far .
first the tacos were good but not the best .
the restaurant was not very clean either .
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
salsa no flavor and tortillas on the tacos could use a slight fry .
we spent so much money and all our orders were wrong .
the salsa did not impress me , tomato based salsa not many options here .
first of all the old lady at the counter was extremely rude !
maybe it 's because it 's hot as hell inside that place ?
the woman at the counter is a rude asshole .
i do n't want to eat in high school cafeteria with picky stupid kids .
they might do better if they made food for adults .
we had high hopes but was very disappointed .
the cheese enchilada was still raw , the cheese not melted .
the beans had a layer of grease so thick , it was disgusting .
and the taco shells had been par cooked to long in advance .
they were cold and soggy .
we will not be back .
i still have to wait another few days for the other pair .
i 'm talking lunch here , not anything fancy .
so , i asked if i could put a little ice in the mug .
`` we sell bags of ice here if you would like some ice '' .
i was beginning to get irritated .
my coffee was also cold which was a complete shame .
bleh , terrible all around ; definitely wo n't be going back .
i asked for some help to remove the storage fees but they would n't .
it looked like a fine blue collar place for pool / beer after work .
still open under a new name , ca n't remember what it is .
have n't been there in _num_ years .
lots of _num_ pound indian women looking for a man .
very nasty .
never went back .
they just ca n't get it going .
i got a green chili burrito and megan got a carne asada burrito .
megan 's carne was dry .
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
some if the staff very unprofessional and program really does n't work .
no way to run a business .
he was easily doing _num_ on my quiet residential street .
this towing company is rude .
insurance company told me they would change the tire once they got there .
worst company ever .
taking time off from work , i was not pleased with what i found .
they do not have a dental specialist .
they offered a free dental exam , which i accepted .
this place was very unprofessional and not very clean .
do your research and not just online as the advertising is misleading !
the coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from starbucks , though .
wo n't come back to this starbucks location .
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
the girl that refunded me was nice but usually i have crappy service there .
staff walk by ignoring you at the mobile pick up area .
i went to this location on a friday and it was so loud inside .
they 've lost my business .
took _num_ days and counting to get a refund .
the first round draft in gilbert is awful !
so the waitress sad `` ok '' and turned around and walked away .
in these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way .
do not eat here .
terrible service and worse food !
it could be any lame bar in any lame city .
( hmmm , chris t , were you there that night ? )
went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed ( and disgusted ? )
it was gross .
their carpet is nasty .
the bathroom was n't much better .
_num_ thumbs down .
horrible !
went there to watch the rose bowl .
walking into this place i did not have high expectations at first glance .
seemed like a typical hole in the wall cheap sports bar .
they have a lot of tvs ... if you dont mind poor quality .
the food was very bland and boring , even for a sports bar .
i do not recommend this bar and will definitely not be going back myself .
went for dinner and food was not good .
the service was mediocre as we had to hunt down the server pretty often .
will definitely stop ordering food here though .
the first round that we ordered was kilt lifter .
for some reason she thought i was weird for not drinking that .
the corona was bubbly and the lime was covered in bubbly goodness !
the chicken strips with buffalo sauce were hot , yummy , and crisp .
i ca n't write a more honest review at this point .
staff , i hope you 're listening , cause i 'm talking .
- they added chicken sliders .
the bread in the sliders has sometimes been tasty and other times stale .
all in all , everything in their menu is overpriced by approximately $ _num_ .
i asked my wife to check it out and she almost threw up .
she said , no i do not need to and dumped the drink out .
i feel sorry for the next person who ordered the same drink .
i love a good dive bar but this place is disgusting !
i wo n't be back .
food was close to bad , service was terrible .
find a better place to spend your money .
the clinic here sucks .
here i am on day _num_ and still sick .
this pharmacy is absolutely terrible .
everyone who works here is unbelievably rude .
like `` ehh sorry .
and this was n't a one time thing that 's happened .
no i mean this is every single time i come here .
but to me this is unacceptable .
they told him he had no insurance and needed to pay $ _num_ .
he was going to pay this because he is feeling so sick .
i convinced him to wait for me to look into this .
it would have taken under a minute to send this to him .
to boot ; all information including the contact info is on the front .
she also called and had it transferred and filled in under half an hour .
to me this is the way customer service is done .
she also found out that the issue was his name was entered wrong .
worst pharmacy service _num_ days in a row !
i had to wait _num_ more hour for the prescriptions to be ready .
i really hate this place !
how ridiculous is that !
the lettuce was wilted , the carrots rubbery .
very disappointing .
ca n't even use my wifi here in peace !
no privacy here either .
oh my goodness , how annoying !
maybe if they decide to stop being so rude !
ok , no problem .
this place is the worst .
the staff is extremely rude and they often get the order wrong .
all mcdonalds are bad but this one is terrible .

this lady had no idea what she was doing absolutely none .
there was no way i was returning to this chop shop today .
thank god i did n't have her cut my hair .
i 'm better off doing a box color .
i have forgotten her name but she is a boxed blonde , age _num_ !
what a horrible experience !
totally rude and rather expensive for a bagel joint .
needless to say , we wo n't be going back .
just read review below and now i know it 's not a fluke .
the couple left without getting their food .
my daughter likes cinnamon & raisin and i like cinnamon & sugar .
there was very little variety there , and i was disappointed .
i did n't see anyone making anything !
terrible .
( they had nothing near what she liked ) .
ugh .
... and then they still do n't get it right ?
customer service is mediocre .
they are not bad , but nothing special .
the bagels were very salty tasting and hard .
i would not go back there again .
not at all what we expected .
certainly not worth over $ _num_ for two sausage , egg and cheeses .
they do not respect our flag !
i was glad there was no wait , which actually surprised me .
what was wonderful were the pancakes , which gave my ratings the two stars .
i did ask without knowing and it paid off !
not impressed .
so i will never go again .
i will not be back .
the only thing that was good was the sip of mimosa i had .
not impressed .
_num_ stars who paid for those nothing special by any means .
seriously who paid for these reviews , does n't taste right to me .
hey you been warned .
we have given _num_ star reviews before .
there are new owners and they are making changes to pay for their buy .
real maple syrup that use to be $ _num_ is $ _num_ .
now they bring a bowl with cheap strawberry jelly .
soft white napkins have been replaced by rough ugly brown napkins .
new coffee introduced this past thursday is terrible .
now , no ice .
if i do n't then i get dry burned ham .
it used to be _num_ meals .
i guess new ownership does n't care about loyal customers !
went for breakfast this morning , was n't very busy and service was horrible .
gave up waiting for the server to bring our check .
the problem is with the food .
unfortunately same deal .
wish it was n't so because i am a stone throw away .
i ventured off the menu this weekend and order some eggs and pancakes .
they did n't charge me for the meal .
my husband was n't impressed so we probably wo n't be back .
i could not even get a return call from the owner .
the location is n't the best .
my drink was n't bad .
i could n't see the date on it though .
not my kind of place .
looks cluttered with all the crap piled up in back and it smells funny .
apparently she does not bother to read the reviews of her coffee shop .
ive been here twice in _num_ years now i know why .
there is junk all over the shop .
there was a gross smell inside which other reviewers said was mold .
i wo n't be back .
it was beyond dirty with zero atmosphere .
the worst part was the dirt though .
i had to wipe dust off the table before i put my bag down .
after i picked it up , it was still covered in dust .
i 'm not sure how that 's possible .
i saw dust in the kitchen area on the counters too .
( oh how i wish i would have read them now ! )
decided to give it a shot , wish i had n't .
will not come back .
the atmosphere and the vibe was definitely off .
turns out my key disappeared from their lock box along with my car overnight .
so far my experience has been bad .
he also advised us that everything is under warranty .
an estimate of _num_ day repair took over _num_ days .
it has recently with the past few years turned over many many times .
it seems to get worse each time i give it another try .
if you buy six bagels they charge you $ _num_ .
that 's $ _num_ each plus tax .
i typically only leave reviews if my experience is positive .
went to this spot on the weekend and the bagels were awful .
i ordered an asiago bagel with egg and cheese .
even the regular bagel with cream cheese was a let down .
the cream cheese tasted sour .
i 'm very disappointed in the quality of the food served here .
wo n't be returning , unfortunately .
i have n't been in years , and probably wo n't be going back .
this place is just strange .
a number _num_ .
close to $ _num_ dollars for that was way over priced .
it 's off that the prices are n't posted on the menu .
also did n't get the second cookie which i also paid for .
there was some sort of greasy slimy build up on all the tables .
ca n't see coming back to thus place .
the owner is so rude !
bagel nosh on the other hand is bland and the worst cream cheese ever .
i really , really do .
that 's a big ole fail on you .
just walked in their showroom and left after a few minutes .
the most unfriendly place i have ever been in .
r & k .
this is where i have taken all my power tools for repairs .
bad policy change .
worst customer service skills i have encountered .
i did n't even want to give them one star .
its difficult to get through and they rarely answer their phone .
this place is a scam and a ripoff .
very disappointed in this salon .
set an appt _num_ days ahead of time .
area were i for my set put on was dirty from a past client .
if i could give this place a negative star i would !
this was such a waist if money and time i will never again return .
last time i went , i requested a fill in .
however , that very same night , one of my nails fell completely off !
then , she explained that she forgot to take her pills that morning .
angry and just dry .
i 'm disappointed and wo n't go back .
i paid $ _num_ for my fill and pedicure and my nails look awful .
so ridiculous .
horrible horrible horrible .
the workers are so rude .
first , i just stopped in on a whim .
big mistake .
exactly what i had specifically asked her not to use .
seriously , just put a tiny drop on the tip of each nail .
however , i definitely do n't think i would be back .
simply not acceptable .
get my order right , and b . )
yeah , i have to agree , this place is consistently bad .
there were at least _num_ employees in the location .
one looked like he might be the manager , but i 'm not sure .
they did make eye contact and then ignored me .
the service is bad and the landscaping is dangerous .
what happened today is unacceptable .
i had really bad customer service tonight .
i hate when i 'm treated rudely .
clearly they need some staff training on customer service .
but when i drive over there i find they are mia .
so sad .
all over them forgetting to give me my small frosty for my daughter .
the drive thru is beyond slow .
the staff was totally rude .
before we went , we called to check the hours .
the pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special .
if you 're going to have mediocre food , you better have exceptional service .
i had to bring it back , and is was still not fixed properly .
i would steer clear of this place .
this was the first time i brought my _num_ year old son here .
neither of the women were very nice or professional .
i 'm just asking for a little professionalism .
the last stylist had this attitude like i was wasting here time .
this time it was worse .
then she turns me _num_ degrees so i ca n't see the mirror .
i yelled to her to stop .
i would give this joint a _num_ star , but it 's not possible .
hate this place !
i could barely walk for _num_ days !
it was so tender and just hurt way too much .
if owner is angry , she shows it when doing your nails .
it 's very uncomfortable .
only good thing was kyle .
if owner is upset about something she take sit out on you .
she 's very aggressive with your manicure , it 's very uncomfortable .
we could n't get out of there fast enough !
she incorrectly diagnosed two of my dogs .
even worse , she prescribed _num_ days worth of strong antibiotics for my dog .
unbelievable , esp .
stupid me .
other than that , the receptionists are the rudest in the world .
the dermatologist gave a wrong diagnosis for my other dog .
he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
the problem is that they charge for every little thing .
not impressed .
i got nothing from the visit and the people in the office were unfriendly .
i hated the place .
i am less pleased with the emergency side of the office .
sadly , our sweet boy passed away a few days later .
of course , they still charged me an outrageous $ _num_ for the exam .
this place is a complete scam .
if you love your pets , do not take your pets here !
the emergency vet took great care of him and he survived the brutal attack .
when they charge you , front desk says only _num_ $ dollars .
it is a money trap .
also , do not go to the eye docs here .
i let them know this , they used that to their advantage .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
i do not recommend taking your pet here .
my dog was not walking pretty much at all .
it 's been _num_ months since his last surgery and is doing awesome !
he walked _num_ miles the other day .
like i said , i wish i did .
these apartments are under new management and not for the better .
the appliances are sub-par .
the monthly rent is about _num_ % above market rate .
the amenities are average , not worth this premium .
overall , these apartments are `` okay . ''
i would recommend looking around outside of the islands community .
i 'm unable to get my packages because of their hours , as well .
a new company took over in january and are horrible !
working in a customer service field myself , this is not acceptable .
i never got a call back and the boards are still in the kitchen .
i was n't able to pay rent in the 1st .
whatever you do , do not make the mistake of moving into this property .
all they care about is money and apparently they want all of mine .
do not rent these apartments regardless of any deals they are offering .
they wo n't even take the time to find the statement on the contract .
for _num_ yr .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
they have a very bad sewer coach roach problem there .
i had so many problems there i do n't even know where to start !
also , the garbage men come every mon .
they keep changing management cause they are horrible .
they are drinking smoking not safe for children to be around .
they require a _num_ day written letter for leaving .
you get one parking per apartment and thats like _num_ spots from your apt .
you can blow up the phone they never pick up to assist you .
i do not recommend to anyone .
i would give them a negative this place is not what it looks like .
hear gun shots at night while trying to sleep thats not normal .
worse than living in the ghetto for real .
however this time they got me on the radiator flush .
wrong !
they also said that it was n't their fault , blah blah .
i gave up , called my regular mechanic who sent a tow truck out .
jiffy lube cracked my radiator with their `` flush '' service .
nice and slow .
_num_ mins in and i 'm still waiting .
they are extremely overpriced and now just flat rude .
unfortunately i will be finding a new place with a friendlier face .
the old nickel and dime routine was too much for me .
nobody needs a nine year battery in arizona .
dont let them cheat you !
they would do pads and fluid change for $ _num_ .
i then called goodyear back to let them know what the dealership said .
do n't let them cheat you !
we then arranged for the customers car to be repaired .
why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present !
we got to emergency and she died less then an hour later .
i really do n't want to spend an extra $ _num_ .
also , do n't think i will be going there for any other services .
store policy is not to send cash through the mail .
employee did not tell me this .
this store has an `` f '' rating with the bbb .
no wonder !
oh please , she was n't spinning it that hard .
after a bit of back and forth ... owner walked me out .
terrible selection of boxes .
would never use again .
horrible experience .
used this store on warner to ship _num_ states over via ups .
horrible service and over priced !
rude , pushy , and way over priced !
you have been warned , do n't do it !
i walked out after _num_ minutes waiting for a chicken sandwich .
$ _num_ drafts .
just do n't go .
my 2nd time there tonight .
`` my drivers license is n't good enough ?
are you freaking joking me ?
they are mediocre at best .
my wife insisted we try this place because she 's really into hot wings .
very , very mediocre .
and to top it all off my boneless wings were barely coated with sauce .
there were only _num_ other very small groups there .
they ran out of boneless wings .
we ended up staying , only because the kids were hungry .
but we were n't happy with the experience .
terrible service ; management could care less about customer satisfaction .
visited my sister in phx last week and had a taste for wings .
no plates or napkins ; had to ask twice for them .
i guess that is an odd request at this establishment .
so glad i do n't live there .
will never return to this location ; possibly never to any location .
please upgrade !
_num_ wings _num_ ?
do n't come in for lunch !
after waiting _num_ minutes for drinks .
_num_ minutes later , the manager tells us to call ahead next time .
this place is no better than a garbage dump .
first , the salad came out with the wings .
wrong !
well , the salad was wrong on top of that .
the sauce was glazed over as if they were sitting out for an hour .
i said no and that i wo n't send food back .
i asked to just take the crap away and take it off my bill .
she responded by telling me i must watch _num_ minutes .
i said no , and asked again to just take them off the bill .
she argued with me _num_ more times about letting them try again .
i am very disappointed with the service and the general manager .
once again , i was there early so we could have a table .
unfortunately everything that our family liked , they changed and ruined it .
first the salad went to gross .
then they added too much salt to almost everything .
however the pizza was garbage and the garlic knots were dry .
this is the general manager talking me a former employee and customer like this !
never ordering from this store again .
waste of money !
the visit cost me $ _num_ .
_num_ days goes by ... no word .
no call back .
no call back .
so , he quickly cut that out and put in a new pipe .
i called the tech sunday , no answer .
called the office and left a message no return call .
talked to a person and left a message no return call .
a new tech called me this time .
this is not a good record for these guys .
_num_ strikes now with putting things together wrong .
he called me back and promised to come fix it .
here we are today -- _num_ days later and still a broken pool system .
and i 'm $ _num_ in the hole !
do not use this company .
i can not wait to cut my ties .
walked in and noticed the outdated decor ... and the smell .
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
i took one bite and it was the worst chili i had ever had !
food is ok , but not the best .
not my favorite place , but ok if you like dive bars .
she is very rude and sassy .
only server is the owner and she 's down right rude .
place is not just outdated but falling apart .
only _num_ stars for this joint .
food was just ok , nothing special .
i wo n't go back .
i can check this dump off my bucket list .
less than _num_ month old window is broken .
after signing the paperwork i was informed they do n't take debit cards .
sound like they have some real money issues beware .
another nursery that never showed or called .
seems to be a problem in az .
thumbs down !
then she had no idea where these plants were .
the worst service .
i went on to the register and left her talking .
the guy on the phone said the price was $ _num_ .
we were excited that the tree was less and assumed it was on sale .
and he replied with `` no , it 's _num_ '' .
that 's $ _num_ more than the quote on the phone .
we left without buying the tree .
she stated the price was $ _num_ .
there is no reason someone should be told _num_ different prices on one tree .
she stated they will not plant anything they do n't deliver .
just say $ _num_ and be done with the false advertising !
i 've really grown to hate applebees ... so why do i go ?
but , the service is what gave this location a one star .
she brought his , not mine and then asked if i wanted sauce .
no , drinks until we asked again .
there are too many options to eat at applebees .
party of _num_ .
it took exactly _num_ minutes for us to get our plates .
she says sorry but thanks for coming .
my beer did not come with her drink so i waited and waited .
what kind of stupid place is this ?
food was cold even after sending back , beer was at _num_ degrees .
rude waitress and no smiles at all .
all was spoiled with waitress , food , and beer !
worse service ever .
my husband and i went in on a friday night .
was sooooo frustrating .
check was _num_ off .
in the short will never ever never visit this establishment again .
beer still warm and service slow .
i recommend skipping this one .
went for lunch closed all signs are off the building no notice .
had an appointment at 8am on a saturday .
_num_ mechanics sitting around and ca n't get it .
waited _num_ minutes and left .
called an hour later and nothing .
instead of trying to get me in and take care of me .
it was nothing about excuses .
blah blah blah .
if you do n't like it go someplace else .
- transmission leak diagnosed as needing the leaking transmission cooler replaced .
i never got the transmission fixed so i gave it two stars .
how wrong i was !
needless to say , i was not a happy camper .
i got there just before _num_ and it still was not ready .
i really hate being lied to .
if that had been done , my opinion might have been a little better .
my husband was much more gracious , thanked him , and shook his hand .
either way , the customer service sucked .
i am more than just a little bit pissed about it .
i would n't recommend taking your vehicle to this location for any reason .
it is n't worth the headaches and frustration .
wish me luck .
got may transmission replaced _num_ years ago and have had nothing but problems since .
yes they have the cheapest oil changes around , which includes rotating tires .
now it seems they suggest work that does n't need to be done .
and jeff does n't work there anymore .
he denied taking the engine apart .
it was obvious that he was trying to rip me off .
avoid this place .
worst service ever with a completely incompetent staff .
i 'm _num_ % sure these guys just disconnected the .
- avoid this place like the plague .
- would give it zero stars if i could .
i shrugged it off and let them work on fixing it .
a few days later it was ready to be picked up .
i 'm with caesar , avoid this place like the plague .
$ _num_ later , more repairs .
i can not believe he owns a business .
interesting , as jack told me it had been done _num_ days before .
i wish there was a way to give negative stars in this situation !
the lack of knowledge from bryan was the worst .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
_num_ hours later no call .
do not call these guys i think the reviews here are all family members .
i went with april a/c because of their great reviews online .
scott came out around noon and then called me with a quote .
do n't waste your time !
just wan na update .
so , stay away from this store !
i have to agree with everyone the customer service is `` non '' .
jeff is the worst .
i would not recommend this company to anyone .
this was the biggest waste on money .
$ _num_ for a cranberry and well vodka .
if you order call vodka they add $ _num_ to your bill .
$ _num_ for a neighborhood bar is crazy in my opinion .
usually i am charged _num_ to $ _num_ more , not $ _num_ .
my husband was charger $ _num_ for one slice of toast .
food is very salty and overcooked .
horrible horrible service .
i will not be visiting this one again .
so i tried again and again it did n't work .
i pushed the button saying my card was n't working in the machine .
_num_ min later my food shows up even though i have n't paid .
so i tell the girl something is wrong it wo n't work .
i said forget it we do n't want the food any more and left .
this is why high school students should n't be the managers .
they think it 's ok to be rude to the customer .
he may or may not be too busy to call me today .
overall the customer service stinks .
worst company in the face of the planet .
i might not even go to any sonic after all this .
not all diamonds are created equal , far from it .
will never recommend this place to anyone and if anything advise against it .
i am beyond disappointed in the customer service i received at this branch .
i had a major purchase on one receipt with $ _num_ kohl 's cash .
they will take that $ _num_ back if you have any returns .
i am completely disappointed in kohl 's .
the night staff at this location leaves something to be desired .
if there was a negative star on here i would give it .
this is the worst department store i have ever been in .
disorganized , a total mess , staff is anything but helpful .
avoid this store at all costs .
if i would have known i would of stopped shopping .
it 's not the staffs fault it went down but hey !
my first apartment and its a nightmare .
cant wait for lease to end .
was ignored for quite a while , then was finally helped .
left numerous voice mail messages and emails - none returned .
second , the layout on two holes is dangerous .
never had those problems elsewhere .
i 've never seen such terrible etiquette on a golf course before .
just drive down the street to dobson ranch .
random complaint - the mirrors in the women 's bathroom are for giants .
the management did n't care when i brought this to their attention .
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
why should the first group have to wait on the 10th hole ?
management does not see the problem with it .
horrible .
very poor course for the price .
dead duck in pond on # _num_ had not been removed .
wo n't be going back .
about all this course offers is a lack of snow in winter !
wo n't come here again .
it 's unfortunate since it 's so close to home .
oh well ... arizona has plenty of other courses .
at pick up , the price had increased _num_ % .
not only that , a $ _num_ shirt was spotted with grease .
we will not be using this location again .
did this place change managers or owners ?
ca n't afford to allow them to continually ruin my clothes .
such a shame because they used to do such a fantastic job .
price was ok.
since i did n't inventory my bag it makes it even worse .
why would i goto a cleaner that needs me to inventory my clothes ?
not sure from what .
i 'm livid at the way this is being handled .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
really disappointed by this place .
before _num_ and she again said sorry and that was it .
this place 's service sucks .
the help lady is a racist .
not sure why this place is still in business .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
but i am sure i wo n't go back again .
the food all has a weird taste and the fountain sodas taste like mold .
do n't be fooled by this `` gourmet '' shit either .
the crust is tasteless & the quality just is n't there .
skip this joint ... .
did n't they close already ?
the way they submitted the loan was false which caused the decline on purpose .
all positive reviews seem to be the last company , not this one .
tried breakfast here and was quite disappointed .
try sunrise cafe instead .
no bueno !
it was awful .
i have had breakfast and also have had dinner and it was just awful .
i ordered the # _num_ , crunchy tacos .
horrible .
i had shredded beef ... tasteless , not seasoned .
the chips were stale as well .
the old school force is strong in this one .
do not eat at this place !
terrible service today !
very slow & bad service .
rude staff and horrible food .
do not waste your time or money .
avoid this place unless you like being ripped off .
kia mentioned if brought to them this repair should have cost $ _num_ .
this was never mentioned to me by the manager .
why the course is nice and very well deserve a _num_ .
so you know how bad the course is ... no you do n't ?
signature hole for me ?
i will play here again , due to miss communication arrangement .
i hate it when course management do n't bother to keep their reputation .
it kills fun experience and get bad reviews like this .
very short term business people behind the counter of the pro shop .
and its not a cheap course to play .
driver tells me it 's just dust on the rocks that needs washing off .
they do n't own up to their screw ups .
did n't speak to me through my entire transaction .
heck , she did n't even tell me the total !
i am not sure how albertsons stays in business .
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
it seems like they need more cashiers .
every time i come here they mess something up .
do not come here if you can help it .
stopped by for late night taco 's .
it looked like something had spilled all over them .
i pulled out the tacos and they were full of grease .
disgusting !
a waste of your time .
the haircut i received was mediocre .
when i picked them up a few days later there were only _num_ .
rude !
never ever use this cleaner !
no thank you no acknowledgement of my business no nothing .
never going back !
i thought to myself , is this really happening ?
it was the most awkward phone call i 've ever had .
it folded over , and made an even worse left over .
however i would not go back unless i was in the area .
too much good stuff close to home .
i would not order the pizza based on those facts .
also , the prices had increased a couple dollars per pizza since last time .
not good and not what i normally see from this place .
i 'm hungry though , so i still dig in .
no matter what the cause is , i will not return .
if new management have taken over , guess what , you have failed .
cooks in the back look really weird and the place is a mess .
do n't think i will ever go back there again and save you money .
its not worth it .
it was so greasy it soaked _num_ paper towels before we could eat it .
but again , not worth the price .
needless to say we wo n't be back !
well , i 've had better pizza at chuck e cheese .
unfortunately it was a total waste of $ _num_ .
first time it took _num_ minutes more than quoted and the pizza was cold !
well i 'm home sick and they are the only place that delivers here .
food was cold and did n't get what i ordered .
this is the worst italian food and restaurant i have ever eaten !
looks like they have pre-made cooked pizza .
ordered rush street pizza for the first and last time .
that is basic customer service especially for a long time customer .
really disappointed .
the pizza was terrible .
no taste .
could n't find the meat .
not worth the trip .
pizza hut would have been better even though thats not real pizza .
i miss ny !
1st time ordering delivery from rush street .
unfortunately , our experience with the food here was poor .
all of the chicken was pink with areas of red and blood in them .
i placed a call to the restaurant as we all know mistakes can happen .
it sounded like she could really care less .
not the way to get new customers .
for all the regulars !
so what was the remedy again ?
so being new to chandler i took this course as a kid friendly course .
my mistake .
very disappointed with this course .
bring a lot of water because there is n't any on the course .
the drink cart will happily fill your bottle for a dollar .
booked tee time on executive course through the pro shop for this morning .
i have no problem with that .
went to pay for bear course and it was almost _num_ per person .
in the end he still would not honor the $ _num_ rate .
either way very disappointed .
the greens and fairways were horrible .
seriously it was that bad .
this place is horrible ... .
golf in the arizona summer with no water on the course .
the drink girl said last call at noon with an 11:30 tee time .
this was by far my worst golf day experience ever !
not quite the way to approach someone on your course .
terrible experience .
if you 're a woman , skip this course and spend your money elsewhere !
not sure but i 've never had it as runny as it is here .
not much flavor in the food .
wish i had read the reviews before eating here .
unfortunately it wo n't be on my list for a return it .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein and chicken with vegetables .
i called to complain and only received a refund on the chicken and vegetables .
i will not be going back !
worst customer service !
the fried rice is boring and the food is kind if salty .
disappointing .
the people were not very friendly and the food was so so .
i do n't think i 'll fine here again anytime soon .
terrible service .
way too much food .
would never recommend .
very greasy and tasteless food .
the orange chicken and the sesame chicken tasted the same .
it had no flavor or very little sauce .
just tasted like heavily battered tasteless chicken .
this place is very disappointing .
worst chinese food i ever had .
also had beef mongolian and it did n't taste right as well .
too bad i took this to go and ate it at home .
my stomach was hurting the next few hours because of their food .
not good .
the food was good , but the customer service was horrible .
instead of everyone having water , they replaced one with coke .
we never changed our mind and i 'm _num_ % sure everyone ordered water .
she just grabbed the menu out of her hand and walked off .
gary ca n't stand behind his warranty or his work .
the owners need to update and clean their tools they use on nails !
bad chinese food fast !
sometimes its edible , most times everything tastes like orange chicken .
worst panda location ... staff is rude and do n't care .
yes they close at 9pm but they do n't care .
it 's ridiculous .
this location needs some training on customer service and food preparation .
it is just ok .
but they do n't have any ideas for nail art .
there are just two nail technicians out here .
takes _num_ minutes to get a menu and silverware .
gag .
she tried to upsell me grilled onions !
me : `` then , no thanks . ''
unfortunately , i will be back .
just had to get these things off my chest .
much smaller portions , cheap on the ingredients and the waitresses have more attitude .
why are so many joints , just to save a buck , cutting quality .
the food is just terrible .
the ingredients are low quality -- i.e .
and sometimes even rotten -- i.e .
the blue cheese gone bad on one visit .
and the coffee was awful and overpriced .
that day was very windy and cold .
after waiting _num_ minutes , we finally got our food .
the food was not that great.
prices were low , but so was the quality of the food .
place is outdated and needs some help .
i would n't put any stars if i could .
first time being at this place and my husband and i got kicked out .
she took the item off and did not even acknowledge the long wait .
waited another _num_ minutes before a waitress came by .
they cancel and leave .
the rest of us get our food and it was a huge disappointment .
i had steak and eggs , both were over cooked and dry .
steak was such bad quality .
fruit was old .
everyone 's meals were not spectacular and not worth the wait at all .
we wasted nearly _num_ hours of our lives on this meal .
ugh .
i know , i know , being a bit harsh if you like them .
sorry , our apologies .
no familiar faces and food just not up to prior visits .
service was a little off too .
too bad , was a great place until the beginning of june .
the hamburger did not taste fresh .
at that time i requested a little more gravy for my hashbrowns .
the gravy never arrived , and i think the manager brought us our bill .
the worst part ... extra , extra , extra .
but i wo n't be back .
i ordered the pancake breakfast : pancakes , two eggs and bacon .
asked for bacon crispy and eggs over medium .
the waitress said real butter is the number one thing customers request .
hmmm , and yet the owners choose not to make it available .
$ _num_ ( myself and hubby ) before tip for a very disappointing meal .
will not be returning .
a little disappointed as we came for lunch .
wanted real food but they are breakfast only until it runs out .
they are also out of tea and it 's not even noon .
we were wrong .
another thing - both of our eggs were cooked wrong .
especially something as easy as an over easy or over hard fried egg .
the food was cold .
my mistake on ordering sunny side up i guess .
the corned beef hash tasted like it came from a can .
i 'm just disappointed because i really wanted to like the place .
i was horribly disappointed by my landscaping job .
she is not .
she either did n't know what she was talking about or worse was lying .
this was the worst , least professional spa service i 've ever received .
they were decently shaped ( nothing special ) but the clean up was atrocious .
however , when i got home , i still had to clean up myself .
i wish i 'd had something even near the experience other yelpers have had .
horrible experience !
i wo n't be going back .
after paying $ _num_ for my first time , i have had better .
sort of disappointed and i wo n't go back .
she also offered me a free facial the next time i came in .
bottom line ... go elsewhere !
however , the front desk receptionist was rude , overbearing and unprofessional .
is n't it my choice what i do with my money ?
will not go back .
she practically looked at me like i was stupid and insane .
i wo n't go back .
was really hoping they would be my neighborhood beauty stop .
i thought ok , how long does it normally take ?
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .
there was absolutely no room in their `` nail salon '' section .
it was awful !
she did n't know how to do an even coat .
so i called the manager , nikki i believe was her name .
i would never go back there to see any nail tech .
does it get any better ?
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
my few hours of pampering ended very badly .
sorry , i can not recommend this place .
the only friendly person that greeted me was the receptionist .
my technician did not welcome me or introduce herself to me .
place is too small .
chair comfort for zero .
as for the pedicure , minimal .
she did , however give me a nice polish on finger and toe nails .
next i had my gel manicure .
shame on me for not leaving then .
she finished the paint job which was not done well .
at this moment , i am very frustrated with this business .
i booked a gel manicure and a pedicure appointment for today at 4:30 pm .
i completely understand if a business gets busy and begins to fall behind .
not impressed .
had to wait a month to get in .
wrong .
said as soon as we filled out paperwork , she was ready for me .
thirty minutes later , my sister still had not been brought back .
i saw her name mentioned at least once , and yes she 's awful .
i felt bad at first for her but do n't pay for shitty service .
the worst part was they did nothing to try and keep my business .
they have yet to respond to either of them .
i was not given the hot oil treatment i purchased .
the spa pedicure was just as bad .
there was no message whatsoever .
i felt extremely unwelcome and just wanted to leave the entire time .
do n't waste your time or your money at this place !
she was very unprofessional and even dropped the f word .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
she did not even clean under my nails !
so disappointed !
horrible horrible performance and service from the employee .
that night my eyes were red and irritated .
i 've been wanting to try this place out for well over a year .
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
the receptionist was busy getting her nails done .
i will not be back .
manicure was good , service was not great , and pedi was terrible .
she would n't change my nail color because it was gel .
i purchased a groupon for a mani pedi and basically just got a mani .
sorry brow lady , but that was just a little ridiculous .
but my experience was awful .
safe to say i will not be returning .
and she was not friendly the entire _num_ minutes i was there .
it 's been over a week and a half and still no call back .
unprofessional and now i 've wasted my money !
not an honest business .
wish _num_ stars was an option .
horrible , horrible service !
they deserve zero stars .
the worst facial ever and it was _num_ minutes long .
this place should just be put out of business .
avoid this place at all costs .
maria went so hard even though i was telling her it hurt .
i am not sure what happened to this place .
the phone even rang and she didnt even bother to pick it up !
this is extremely bad customer service !
still to this day , no one has called .
i did n't bother to show up since no one had called me back .
did i waste my money ?
there was no other brow lady , no other occupied shop for that matter .
this lady was not there even with a confirmed appointment .
the building itself looks abandoned .
not going back .
it is no big deal .
way too crowded , even on weekday mornings .
not worth the wait .
nothing special .
has the usual variety of egg dishes , pancakes , omelets , etc .
the wait can be long for weekend brunch .
if it gets longer than _num_ minutes , i would just go somewhere else .
the coffee was terrible and the burrito was yuck .
well , sadly i made the mistake of coming here .
uh , forget it .
ok , i am a big breakfast fan , trust me .
i have not had a good experience at this place .
as for the food , i ordered the huevos rancheros .
the eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny !
i was disgusted !
long wait .
tasted the cakes and wished i 'd ordered the eggs .
there are much better places to eat breakfast for the price .
tomato sauce + chicken broth does not = tomato soup !
i was soooo excited to eat here .
but i would rather eat at ihop than this place .
only for the pomegranate smoothie .
otherwise , it was pretty bland stuff .
not so much .
servers were ok , though seemed very not thrilled to be there .
rude .
terrible service .
the strawberry pancakes were good and overall the portions were very big .
food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends .
my biggest problem with the restaurant - the service .
needless to say , they did n't win a loyal customer with me .
first of all , too expensive .
where did this tomato come from , south america ?
very disappointed .
waitresses wear tight black pants .
but both visits featured mediocre food ( esp .
it would n't be fair !
thirsty people are unhappy people .
k so there 's that u know which was not really cool .
then i mean the food comes .
it was all ok , i mean i didnt order anything to crazy .
we waited over an hour for a table .
the hostesses were beyond rude .
the food was ok but definitely not worth the wait .
do n't waste your time !
very disappointing .
hardly any wait , and now i know why .
the hollandaise flavor was off as well .
the waitress was ok but not overly attentive .
$ _num_ for a glass of cranberry juice .
it 's the only possible explanation for this place .
if i could give it a minus _num_ i would .
boy was i wrong .
we ordered the _num_ egg , bacon , toast that came with fruit .
nothing ...
the vibe was n't great in there it was a very negative feeling .
boyfriend & i were in scottsdale for golf vacation so breakfast was a must .
very busy , always a wait to get in .
patio is loud .
no soda .
in my opinion , good food does not make up for horrible customer service .
my family and i ate here just a few days ago .
she never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess !
the bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather .
overall , none of us will be returning to this place !
it was is so overrated .
have eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly pleased .
ate here saturday november 3rd .
later , after no other food , stomach problems and out it came .
visiting from out of town and went to the breakfast club .
worst breakfast experience ever .
its horrible .
decent food but horrible owner .
does n't believe it in ?
`` what about all this fake sugar on the table for our coffee ?
he says it would upset too many people if we took it away .
so this guy takes his stand with diet soda ?
hell , diet or anything else , it is all bad for you .
less than mediocre food .
i would rather eat at the herb box .
big mistake .
h u g e mistake !
gag ... ... .
terrible !
some of the worst service and management i 've ever seen !
the food was overpriced , their pancakes cost $ _num_ without any sides .
great food , but horrible service .
no one at the hostess stand smiled or greeted us when we walked in .
_num_ minutes go by , we ask again , and eventually get them .
the toast came cold , with no butter or jam .
the ham was okay , but `` off the bone '' is an exaggeration .
however , no toast was present .
we were the first people in the restaurant at 6am .
i ordered huevos rancheros and my friends ordered biscuits and gravy .
we were the first orders in , no one else was in the restaurant .
$ _num_ for breakfast was not worth it .
no we did not .
still no excuse .
needless to say , we were extremely disappointed with the breakfast club .
waited about _num_ mins , not even a glass of water .
several employees walked passed us -- so we left .
looked like a nice place but did n't want to deal with crappy service .
honestly , ive never written a bad comment on yelp .
a group of _num_ of us went on a busy saturday morning .
but i have never been treated like that before as a guest .
made the mistake of not reading them before hand .
the service sucked .
the waitress sucked .
she really pissed me off .
too bad we took her advice .
my husband got the bird omelet which i tasted and yuck .
it was completely bland .
if they just read their own reviews they would stop doing that .
the flavors together were just not that good .
i really ca n't recommend the breakfast club .
after about _num_ minutes of this , i was fed up .
unfortunately , i was wrong .
regardless , it absolutely ruined my visit .
went here to celebrate graduation and had the worst possible experience of my life .
three of us had seats at the bar and two were standing behind .
they did not even comp our meal which had turned into a disaster .
firstly it is expensive .
skip this place and go elsewhere !
in this , breakfast club fails .
$ _num_ `` harris ranch '' filet well .
also , never have coffee here .
a member of a party can not join mid meal .
i want to eat comfortably , i did n't order no food to go .
i really did not want to eat my breakfast next to a large dog .
servers attention was elsewhere ... never listened to our order .
horrible service !
the are rude and very snobby for a service that should be great .
server was not friendly , french toast was dry bread inside .
been here before and it was much better .
it was brought up to the waitress and she did not handle it well .
he declined and she did nothing else to comp for it .
sent back our bloody mary 's because they were watery and bland .
would n't go back .
the 1st rule of the breakfast club is never eat at the breakfast club .
the 2nd rule is never talk about the breakfast club .
the bottom line : sometimes it 's ok , sometimes it 's not .
it 's hit or miss with no consistency .
i am a big eggs benedict fan and was eager to try their version .
sadly , the hollandaise sauce tasted more like lemonade than hollandaise .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
they are flat but ok .
ick .
bitter and yet weak .
the last time we went , i just asked for plain hot water .
but they are n't .
the breakfast club seems to just take it all for granted .
this place could be amazing , but it just is n't .
extremely rude .
we will not be back .
it was the service that our group received today that was not so good .
my company often orders breakfast to go from the breakfast club for store meetings .
she seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time .
i ordered the jalapeno biscuits and gravy which were amazing .
it is unfortunate because the food is great .
i guess it 's to go orders only from here on out .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
today was pretty terrible .
just covered in oil .
i wo n't be back for quite a while .
it was not .
she looked at him funny , went back , eventually brought that out .
it was okay but nothing special .
the _num_ of us ordered breakfast and talked throughout our meal .
no , she did not .
never gave us that chance .
no like suggestions or stars by popular plates how most places have it now .
bacon , ham , hash browns , etc .
very disappointed .
the description did n't explain any of it or have any pictures .
on my 6th bite i could n't do it .
my stomach was n't allowing it .
it was n't really bad .
it just was n't acceptable .
did n't know i had filet mignon .
my stomach did not accept any of this food .
i really was disappointed and im truly never coming back here again .
i think mcdonald 's ice coffee is better .
just truly was n't satisfied .
customer service was alright .
was advised there 's no service at these tables .
so , instead of bringing out food out on plates .
for 8am on a monday morning they were n't packed .
i wo n't be going back .
i ordered an omelet my way and did not get it my way !
the bacon was in the omelet which i did not request .
i 'm not sure what his purpose was .
first off , i want to say that the hostesses was amazing .
no smile , no hello , nothing .
meanwhile she makes no attempt at a conversation .
this will cause for some interesting business if you continue to hire shitty waitress .
food was cold , no follow up by the waitress , awful service .
we still left $ _num_ on top of a $ _num_ bill .
wo n't be back .
the only soda they have is coke .
no diet coke .
no sprite .
i repeat : no diet coke .
not even diet pepsi .
this is my nightmare .
after this experience i do n't think i will ever return .
he completely turned me off of this place .
right now i 'm very annoyed .
so this booth sat empty until he got here .
not impressed breakfast club .
probably about the worst bloody mary i have ever had in my life !
skip this !
the past three times i have been the staff was extremely rude .
that being said , the food here made me ill , literally .
i can only assume it is due to the undercooked eggs i was served .
the manager did n't even come talk to us .
still i will not be back .
how many _num_ stars do you see ?
yes , that 's why i 'm here today .
she asked for some spinach added to hers .
hardly what i would call wild .
no explanation , just excuses .
no offer to take it back and fix it .
i did n't want to cause a scene that would have embarrassed my girlfriend .
if i could give zero stars i would .
poor service .
hostesses who give your table away to the wrong party .
spend your hard earned money somewhere else !
worst service i 've ever received !
waited _num_ mins .
not sure why we even decided why to try something new .
deplorable , is how i describe my experience at the breakfast club .
there was no one at the front .
in fact , three waitresses made eye contact with us then ignored us .
they lost there _num_ % tip i wo n't be coming back !
a customer and a waitress ( not even mine ) apologized .
note : my party of _num_ waited _num_ hour for a table .
deserves _num_ stars .
she said _num_ more minutes , _num_ minute later we got seated .
a bit more friendliness would go a very very long way .
fails the purpose .
terrible food .
and , i suspect , illegal hiring practices .
i had the worst experience here this morning .
upon arrival i was told _num_ minutes for a party of two .
thank you for the complete waste of time .
boy was i disappointed .
my primary complaint is not food but service .
secondly , i never asked for a free meal .
i just returned it and asked for something else .
mediocre food .
and the bloody mary was all show and no taste .
such a major disappointment .
what a waste of our morning .
horrible waste of my saturday .
well , long wait .
no coffee , wrong meal delivered .
restaurant was way too loud .
i could not tell any difference in the noise level .
she was standing right next to me .
i again was very polite throughout my entire time there .
steve is a jerk and needs serious training on how to treat customers .
they just want your money .
turns out i was right and he was wrong .
there is enough competition in this city that you can avoid this company .
i hate the san francisco giants - minus _num_ stars !
i hate drunk giants fans - minus _num_ stars !
no biggie .
an open mind and no outside food .
but only _num_ bottled water per person .
get there early , it does pack up pretty quickly .
overall , i do not think we will go here again .
just no reason .
went online to buy two tickets for a night spring training game .
the tickets they sold me are for standing room or lawn only .
they called back later and told me no refund tough luck .
called my cc company .
i would have given them zero stars but it was not an option .
next time , try to get into the website earlier to get real seats !
worst stadium experience i 've had anywhere .
no signage .
no help .
every park i 've been to in the valley has provided a better experience .
not even close .
no wonder the stadium was half full .
they charge full price for an event they only have half the merchandise .
another sign of poor leadership .
if you want a really nice park try salt river fields or camelback ranch .
the price out on the sign for gas is the cash price .
this `` new '' management is super unprofessional and rude to customers .
this gas station does not know what customer service is .
also , there pumps are always out of service .
went back , seems to suck even more than before .
totally turns me off to buying anything .
they looked right at me and did n't even acknowledge me or smile .
i noticed two other customers walked in and nothing .
the only time they acknowledged me was when i walked to the cash wrap .
by far the worst experience shopping today .
it is not what it 's hyped up to be .
customer service is lacking .
i 'll spend my money in monterey .
go to free car show at indian bend any saturday .
first off their website said they opened at 8am on sat .
secondly , it costs $ _num_ per person to get in on sat morning .
they charge a $ _num_ convenience fee when you buy online .
no gown information .
it was ridiculous !
so i 've had to cancel my appointment yet again .
ca n't wait to never return .
ca n't wait to never return .
this place was horrible .
would n't go back and would n't recommend to anyone else .
customer service is horrible .
we are now _num_ days out and still no dress .
she has called every week for the last month and they have no answers .
wish there was an option were you could give no stars !
whatever you do do not get your dress from this place !
after all her hard work it still did n't fit right .
oh and this all happened _num_ days before my wedding !
whatever you do do not do business with this establishment !
owner needs to get new staff and clearly bring back customer service .
i got the worst hair cut here !
feel like i wasted my time and money .
would not recommend .
i did not like the hairdresser at all .
will never return to this salon just because of this bad experience .
the owners make the salon less than stellar .
very unhappy with them .
horrible stylist !
groupon of $ _num_ for a `` salon cut and style '' .
dude ... it was just ok .
nothing special and i wo n't be back .
most businesses understand that without the customer , the business would n't exist .
you called me back once and i have n't heard back from you since .
a very disappointed former customer .
most businesses understand that without the customer , the business would n't exist .
you called me back once and i have n't heard back from you since .
a very disappointed former customer .
sandy finally called me back after _num_ voice mail messages and my previous review .
it was a great deal - $ _num_ for haircut and partial highlight .
but since we had an expectations , unfortunately the experience fell way short .
i expected to be inquired what exactly am i looking for .
anyway i informed about the same myself .
the entire set up was not even relaxing .
i really hoped better from this place so disappointed .
supposed to be _num_ minutes long and she ended _num_ minutes early .
the facial itself was fine but way too short .
i would not go back to this salon .
however , i have not done that .
cookies had just come out of the oven .
new drive through is a wreck waiting to happen .
it was crowded and everyone thinks they should rush ahead at the same time .
what a ridiculous design !
and speaking of food , it 's crappy half the time now .
mcdonald 's food is always the same crap so i 'm not reviewing that .
the employees at this location are rude and they have cockroaches .
other than that is is like every other mcdonald 's in the us .
do n't think she knows how to key in the order correctly .
been here _num_ times .
twice , my order was wrong .
hate this place .
this is the only mcdonalds i have been in that does this .
they have some odd policies and will no longer earn my business .
if i could give zero stars i def would .
if i could leave i would .
i am not _num_ % sure but it sure seems like it .
the most horrible , rude and incompetent staff !
unfortunately the staff are apparently trained to be jerks .
you lost a another few customers today at your location .
4th wrong order from here .
always wrong .
have complained to the mgr before .
he does n't care .
i had a terrible experience with this company .
i took a bridesmaid dress in _num_ weeks before the wedding .
at this point i was angry .
to boot it cost me $ _num_ .
i was very disappointed in the services here .
instead , nothing .
ok , i am not the kind to write reviews .
let me tell you i have not worn them very much at all .
i was even going to roll the money into something else from their store .
no diamonds were missing .
it is appalling that they refused to give me any money .
do not give them your money .
i felt rushed from the second i walked in the door .
first , it was extremely small .
ugh .
but unfortunately , you let me down !
no bottled water - ok , i can deal with that .
i miss the picnic company i know and love !
mom and dad just do n't get me .
seriously though , i have never shopped here .
i 've been here _num_ times in the past year and a half .
( ha ! )
if i could give this pizza hut no stars i would .
i was so disappointed ... for the last time with this location .
i wish that i could give this place half a star .
which i probably should have done .
so i went to my neighbors house and use their phone .
i want some god damn pizza hut lol !
pizza was n't hot and barely any toppings on it .
terrible !
nasty !
_num_ times in a row we had late delivery and wrong order !
should n't even give _num_ stars .
extremely disappointed with this store .
so i called and was surprised that someone actually answered .
pizza hut is paying him to do absolutely nothing !
i usually choose pizza hut among other competitors but not after this experience .
this place just lost _num_ potential clients from not answering their phones .
unfortunately i wo n't ever know because no one answers the phone .
i 've tried repeatedly to make an appointment to no avail .
i find a salon without anyone answering the phones to be highly unprofessional .
this place fails .
just totally fails .
ok , so they decided to extend their hours , but you know what ?
not cool .
con : the food sucked .
it was just plain bad .
just stay away from this place .
in texas , tamales are much smaller .
wait , no , that does n't seem right actually .
suck a dick julio 's too .
it 's horrible .
it is disgusting .
do n't bother with the salsa , it comes from a jar .
the lot was full but there was no one in the restaurant .
did n't start with a good impression at all .
i 've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years , i get it .
but i did n't even get a smile , or even eye contact .
if you like good service , do n't waste your time .
very disappointed and will not go back .
just crappy mexican food the best part was the mexican flag in my food .
but this a disgrace to mexico in every way possible .
the salsa is watery and nasty .
do n't waste your time .
it was n't frozen , either .
it was this ... ugh .
lately they have really been falling apart .
my last lunch actually gave me the runs .
too bad , now i have to find another place for my mexican lunches .
when i entered this place i was confused if they were open or not .
i only stayed because i was meeting friends for brunch .
i wo n't even get started on the disappointment in the food .
the chicken and other meats ( steak especially ) was very flavorless as well .
the only highlight of our meal was the chips .
would not go back again .
the only reason i went is because my dad wanted a taco .
i miss the days when julio g 's was down the street .
gross .
prices are reasonable and food is served quickly .
horrible .
poor quality food .
sugary tomato sauce on the enchilada .
hubs had pork that was fatty and bland .
gross .
recently i have noticed the quality of the food has gone way down .
sad , this used to be a staple in my family .
this location is a total disappointment .
it was a total waste of $ _num_ .
if they toast your bun , consider yourself lucky .
if your fries are hot , consider yourself lucky .
took over _num_ mins to get _num_ burgers , and fries .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
but the service is horrible .
wo n't go back again .
i 'll try five brothers next door instead .
i ate my whole dinner ( slowly ) , while they were still waiting .
service was awful .
they are known for having thin , smashed , juicy meat and tasty fries .
this is not the case at this particular location in the scottsdale fashion square .
i got the worst food poisoning from here .
this place is officially off of our rotation and we will never return !
the chips and salsa were pretty standard , if a little bland .
the guacamole was bad .
nothing stands out as far as i am concerned though ... .
the food was nothing to write home about .
we had n't even sat down when the chips and salsa arrived .
the service was good but not enough to bring me back .
i think this is the step between taco time and an authentic mexican restaurant .
you should skip this place .
julio g 's is a poster child for everything a restaurant should not be .
you 've been warned ... bleh .
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
well , probably not the last time , but it should be .
the food here is utterly horrible .
my first mistake of the evening was choosing this place for dinner .
at any rate , do n't go here .
it is disgusting .
thats all i 'm gon na say .
this place serves some sort of food but it is not mexican .
please , please avoid the grease bomb served here .
very sketchy office & no front desk person .
waiting room is very small .
wednesday around _num_ pm .
there was no receptionist and i waited _num_ minutes , still no one .
who does that anymore !
do n't believe me ?
flip to the back and see the last _num_ pages or so .
the party pics are usually why people check it out .
( i do n't care if it 's designer .
_num_ gets two stars from me .
but _num_ ca n't really consider itself a magazine , can it ?
it seems to always be crowded .
it 's seriously dump though - terrible food made from garbage ingredients .
the second time the food was so bland it made me want to cry .
it was hot , but there was absolutely no flavor ... or texture .
the staff was friendly , and the place was clean .
i really do n't get it .
anyway , there really is n't much to say about this place .
they are serving up extremely mediocre mexican food .
the rest of the stuff on the plate was crap .
the price for the taco plate and a large horchata was $ _num_ .
it 's not .
not cool .
it can only get better from here .
$ _num_ corona on a sunday night ?
awesome for some , but not for me .
so i guess do n't buy drafts there .
dos has fallen far from it 's old tempe trailer park !
um yeah i am almost _num_ and my buddy just turned _num_ .
so after showing our id 's we go in and grab some beers .
i walk a line for him and say see obviously not drunk .
and had to beg for chips and salsa .
skip this one .
food , nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant .
i felt even more like a valued customer from this point on .
i asked again for waters ; nope ... .
when we ordered , i asked for chips and salsa .
sorry , too late for chips and salsa .
i sent the chips back .
after we ordered our food , the wait guy never came back .
the big problem was the waiter and waitress .
the whole experience just sucked .
i hated that place .
i 'm not really sure who i tipped .
there was a mistake on our bill , so we flagged down a waitress .
drinks : watered down margaritas .
food : we ordered queso , a breakfast burrito , and a bean burrito .
nasty .
i wish i could say the same for my burrito .
to spice things up , i added guac to my burrito .
something the menu stated would be a $ _num_ upgrade -- fine by me .
when the bill came , i found out the guac was $ _num_ .
yet , still not the first place i 'm willing to go to .
it was awful .
no service for the first _num_ mins we were there .
after that , was served _num_ bottled beers and ( delicious ) tacos .
never to return and will never recommend .
honestly i do n't get it .
she brought us _num_ beers and never came back .
not so much .
i would go back , just hopefully get a different server .
drinks were nasty !
this is not mexican food !
she then handed me a menu .
the tortillas they come on are gross .
the rice was cold and crunchy and the beans were extremely salty .
what a waste of time .
it is not mexican food !
he was absolutely rude to everyone .
i am so disappointed .
look at my previous reviews of other dos and i am typically very fair .
customer service by management here was terrible .
we wo n't be back next month or anytime after that .
not really expecting much but cold beer and hot food .
this place is just eh in my book .
but the food just was not good .
really , no flavor in the tacos or queso .
there are so many different places in scottsdale that are better .
the food is mediocre and the staff are total jerks .
we will not be back and you should n't go either .
the second bartender named ted , ( _num_ hour ) was absolutely obnoxious .
i have not been treated soo horrible in my entire life .
not to mention , he knew it was a friends birthday .
but the service was pretty rough .
the restroom on my , it was scary .
the service was horrible to top off the experience .
went there with a group of probably around _num_ people saturday night .
it was absurd .
terrible service .
probably the worst service i ever had .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
a little shocked , i replied were there are _num_ of us .
he asked what i wanted to drink and i walked away .
to all other patrons , i would avoid it .
we sat at the bar and the bartender was very rude .
i was disappointed with the scottsdale location .
i feel like i threw away money by going there .
i wo n't be going back .
not to mention their awesome staff !
do n't effing go here .
this place is not the cheap place to drink in scottsdale .
i will never purchase a couch from pottery barn again .
wrong again .
and though the latest owners are nicer than the previous , nothing else improved .
_num_ ) its close and i did n't feel like driving .
and _num_ ) i did not feel like walking over to paradise .
i pay the dude and the gal starts making my salad .
wait .
its not the container that the cheese was purchased in .
i decide to go back to pacific 's and get my money back .
everything is greasy and not very fresh .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
can you say worst customer service ever ?
the lady that rang me up was n't friendly either .
this place deserves to go out of business .
did n't seem to care about their job .
then my boyfriend walked in , who also was not greeted .
express took your business due to poor customer service , and experience .
the first time my husband went the haircut was not that great .
the third time was not so good .
anyone that hurts my kid and is so impatient with him is done .
came in to a creepy looking man and felt very unwelcome and awkward .
wo n't be coming back .
i do not recommend giving it a try .
impossible !
um , no thanks .
dressing attendant was beyond clueless and did not want to help find sizes .
this store though has some horrible associates .
there was one girl working who was very helpful and friendly .
did n't walk over and help me find the style i was looking for .
no thank you .
in addition , no one asked if i needed help .
your store employees are pathetic .
at first , he was very helpful .
all of a sudden , the owner got very mad .
he said to us , `` i do n't have time for this .
you 're wasting my time .
please do not frequent this store .
very rude !
this store is located in old town scottsdale gives tourists a bad experience .
needless to say , this store does not deserve one star .
the man that works here is horrible .
i walked in shopping for presents for numerous people .
do not support this store .
oh this was not good .
we have large plates for the meal , but no small plates .
no sauce .
does the pasta come with sauce ?
the no rules pasta with chicken was dry .
the chicken - a grilled breast tossed on the top of the pasta .
not cut into strips or cubes .
i 've always been disappointed with the level of service and quality of food .
no more .
manager apologized , did n't take plate away .
she told me not to be angry , she had other tables .
my food was comped , got a $ _num_ gift card , left hungry .
i 'm dissapointed in this restaurant , i really wanted to like it .
it 's not worth it .
ok , i get it .
but really , the wait staff sucks .
slow , and unprofessional , and in no way hospitable .
the food is not bad , the prices can be a bit lower .
my bad .
orange table ?
the service , however , is not so great .
clearly , the chef has not heard of seasonings .
the service was absolutely horrible .
he was incredibly rude and took his sweet time with everything .
our waiter was not the only rude one , either .
there was just a general attitude problem .
before we ate already starting with a bad taste in our mouths .
drinks finally came , we ate and left .
unfortunately , the service is far from perfection .
she became slightly more pleasant , but the wait for everything was ridiculous .
at the point our food arrived , we still had no utensils .
i 'm pissed .
and is slow service ever an acceptable policy !
no more .
they screwed up our order and brought out the wrong thing .
wrong .
it took another _num_ minutes to get our correct order .
why it takes the orange table _num_ minutes is beyond me .
their staff is rude , their kitchen is slow and their pancakes are overpriced .
we waited another _num_ minutes for our drinks to come out .
another _num_ minutes later our food arrived .
the food was okay but expensive at least the oj was awesome .
ordered _num_ drinks .
ended up leaving and going to az _num_ instead .
disappointing .
totally not my favorite place to go .
the sandwiches are n't that good .
they 're really expensive and do n't even come with any sides .
most of them are bland .
i hate giving bad reviews and i really want to like this place .
b. refilling your horrible coffee without asking first .
i have never been a server so i really would not know .
some time is reasonable but over thirty minutes for eggs ?
see , i have been here twice before and the service has been awful .
well , third time is not a charm .
there is always at least one item forgotten .
i probably will not be going back for a long while .
most of the time it is n't super crowded .
me : `` it does n't taste anything like it usually does . ''
had a little bit of a wait , but not too long .
so we left unsure what all the hype was about and a little disappointed .
that being said , i have no plans on coming back .
i 've been coming here off and on for a couple years .
each time gets more and more disappointing .
big mistake .
not forever , but a little long for a breakfast menu .
i ordered the eggs benedict , and my friend ordered chocolate chip pancakes .
the hollandaise was creamy with just a hint of citrus tart .
the pancakes were a little dry however .
i do n't care how good it is , syrup ai n't $ _num_ .
orange table does n't cut it .
disappointed .
worst service i have ever experienced .
we received no attention for _num_ minutes after we sat down .
they could n't even bring us water after we asked twice .
took another _num_ minutes to get just one bloody mary .
food was wrong when it came out .
this place is just a complete joke !
terrible service , terrible prices , mediocre food , what a ripoff !
worst i 've ever been to !
terrible the last _num_ times i 've been in !
so sad .
i always go on the weekend , and the wait is no surprise .
she was n't managing anything .
just do n't know why they were so slow .
all this while the tables surrounding were served and cleared .
there was very little hollandaise sauce .
my server did n't really seem to care about my experience either .
on the bright side the monkey pancake was awesome .
it was the most ridiculous display of what not to do as a manager .
the service is slow and unorganized .
no kids menu ... not even anything remotely kid friendly .
prices are ridiculous and fruit is extra !
unfortunately , i had very poor service during my last visit .
when i complained to the manager , he made excuses and was disrespectful .
my husband and i are locals and had frequented this restaurant in the past .
stopped here two weeks ago as i am always looking for yummy pancakes .
i ordered the mexican chocolate latte and it was okay .
to me it was lacking something .
i was not impressed with the single overpriced pancake .
$ _num_ for extra syrup ?
screwed up orders and it took over _num_ minutes to get our food !
food was okay .
a little pricey for an average meal with not much ambiance .
finally found it unfortunately !
my husband had banana pancakes with side of bacon .
pancakes were honestly no joke the worst i have ever had .
husband said it wasnt that bad but he wouldnt have it again .
it really was not that good to me .
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
asked the hub would you go back he said no .
i of course would never go back .
lots of bad reviews there .
they seem to have had the same experience i had .
the sandwiches are ok , but come with no sides .
and avoid the pastries .
slow food prep ( _num_ minutes from order to serve ) .
server slow and indifferent .
not enough to change my opinion that the establishment is not worth the rating .
everything from there on went bad .
and only cleared my plate we were clearly both done .
we had to request menus after having waited for approximately _num_ minutes .
all of our food was cold including the mexican chocolate lattes .
we will not be back .
please know that this is a dog friendly restaurant .
went here , they were out of everything .
i am not impressed , but also because i was expecting a lot .
( go in with low expectations i guess ? )
was n't busy , no biggie .
we politely sent them back and asked for coffee instead .
she asked if he would mind stepping aside so she could speak to him .
needless to say , we wo n't be returning .
brunch fail .
not a good way to cure a hangover .
too loud inside and too crowded for success .
unfortunate .
service ( john ) : extremely poor .
( not exaggerating here , guy apparently forgot he works for tips ) .
result : never going back again , never saying a kind word .
entirely too much competition in this area .
total brunch fail .
food was not good .
they discounted our food but we all barely ate - very disappointing brunch !
lots of better places around !
not a charm .
it is not a huge place !
this place gets an f !
which is sad because this place has potential .
but i 'm not willing to come back after this experience .
how long does it take to cook an egg ?
no exaggeration .
i love sweet things but this was too much .
they discounted our food , not our drinks .
maybe we will call in a togo order _num_ hours prior to meal time .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
the food was really undercooked and slow to get .
my friend got the monkey cakes , which were undercooked .
we wo n't be rushing back .
the granola was store bought , bland , nothing special .
ordered eggs benedict but they had sold out !
probably the worst breakfast that i have ever had - both food and atmosphere .
worst of all , we had reservations !
needless to say , expectations were far from met .
too many good restaurants in the area to settle for this .
the food itself is n't awful .
the expiration date was september _num_ , _num_ .
another owner or manager came to the table and insisted that i pay .
what horrible management .
instead , he insulted us .
service was mediocre .
this guy has no bedside manner and is rather unfriendly .
his practice is an unorganized mess .
will be finding someone else next time .
this entire practice is terrible .
therefore , _num_ star .
i like buying new tires that are no good .
so they serve food after 2am ?
everyone that has sat on those couches should go get tested immediately .
obviously not new couches .
two bathrooms with one room each doesnt cut it for me .
seriously that is lame .
the place smelled like garbage ... i am not kidding .
i am not kidding you this happened three times .
but this stuff was nasty .
nice server chick is the only reason why i give this place _num_ stars .
mickey 's is always packed with the worst people in town .
always has been smelly _num_ me .
not impressed .
and i do n't prefer _num_ hang out with pretentious crowds like that .
this is not the case .
how about allowing people to complete paperwork online and not waste their time ?
this was the most uncomfortable ultrasound i 've had yet .
the tech did not seem experienced and pressed way too hard against my belly .
been to _num_ concerts this year .
it was very terrible sound system .
there was a great event i attended recently but sound system was awful .
i ended up buying _num_ shirts and _num_ pants there .
she brought out something that looked not even close to what i asked for .
i then asked for a fitting room and she showed me the way .
i would have died if one of my associates treated someone this poorly .
rude employees .
was n't greeted , just looked at .
there loss because i was willing to spend money .
would give it a zero if i could .
i guess the manager got too greedy for his own good .
lame .
stupid .
then i had to pay $ _num_ to sit at a decent table .
there were only a few free tables and they were taken .
makes no sense .
dont forget $ _num_ cover charge and a $ _num_ water .
do n't you want privacy , hence the name `` private dance '' ?
worst place ever .
i guess she has a money tree .
bottom line save your time and money just go straight to somewhere else .
do n't like it , too bad .
this place is soooo overrated , crowded and the music is not memorable .
tacky !
bring back the other band !
however , we are in az and thought nachos would be a safe bet .
more than half the stale chips had nothing on them .
$ _num_ for the nachos ?
only the rail bottles of alcohol .
i will not be going back and i do n't recommend .
made us feel like a piece of crap on the bottom of his shoe .
obviously does n't like visitors .
the atmosphere was neat although it is pretty cramped in there .
disappointing is the word that first comes to mind .
good drinks .
rude bartender .
he ( tim ) ignored us and was super unfriendly .
i gave them _num_ star because the blonde female bartender has a nasty attitude .
i was sitting at the bar and left my drink to use the restroom .
when i returned my drink had been thrown away .
when i questioned the bartender , she was over the top rude and nasty .
not good at all .
not a destination place for its cuisine !
but the hockey puck $ _num_ burger ; yuck !
singer was okay but nowhere near the professional level .
wrong !
the chicken tasted more like the grill than the meat itself .
the `` salad '' was shredded lettuce with dressing , no veggies .
horrible service !
since the moment we sat down they gave us a huge attitude .
gross .
_num_ stars go to food .
girl at front , not so great .
no greeting as i came in .
it is just so hard to pull off .
unfortunately , pita house falls short .
falafel was not very good .
tastes bland and a bit stale as if it was sitting around for awhile .
the pita bread was not fresh at all , way too chewy .
i was very disappointed .
someone from the kitchen delivered our food .
not worth it at all .
she was the only reason they got _num_ star .
i found a dead fly in my salad coated in dressing .
the server did n't charge me at least but oh my goodness .
we arrived on a sunday for lunch .
there was garbage , literally garbage , all over the floor by our table .
not appetizing .
the bathroom was nothing short of 3rd world .
big mistake .
i ordered the gyro pita with the house salad .
i dive into my lunch and something is off .
my gyro was drowning in tzatziki .
if i return , it wont be for a while .
absolute worst service i have ever experienced .
they are rude and inattentive .
i would never come back .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
the service along with the hookah service is bad .
they take forever to come by to blow out the bowl .
this used to be pretty good , now , not so much .
the place smelled like cigarette smoke and spice .
not good .
that was kind of disgusting too .
no way i would return .
painfully slow service .
finally got our appetizer - chicken with garlic and mushrooms .
gross .
the chicken and sauce were good but seriously ?
iceberg lettuce ?
it did come with tzatziki sauce but , i 've had better .
this tasted like it came out of a bottle - definitely not freshly made .
and the food is just ok .
probably wo n't be back .
the salad was only lettuce and vinaigrette with a fly .
everything i 've had there i 've had better elsewhere .
this place is terrible !
also their food is over priced and mediocre at best .
quality of food was so-so and service was slow .
forgot _num_ of our dishes when our food arrived .
it did n't seem that bad when we walked onto the patio .
for the quality of the meal the price was way too high .
i wo n't be going back .
awful service and unfriendly staff .
i would have given them no stars if it was an option .
oh , and the hostess was smoking hookah while serving us .
will miss this place after being a dedicated patron for _num_ years .
maybe it 's not as bad as i thought . ''
i left after about half an hour of no acknowledgement .
because he for damn sure does not run this establishment like a business .
there were two servers that i saw in the half hour i was waiting .
as all employees have previously shown .
about _num_ minutes after that happened , i left .
this is counting my run ins with the tsa .
i ca n't imagine a better establishment for the services of gordon ramsey .
until then , i 'm never coming back again .
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
disappointing , stay away .
i wo n't be back .
the food was horrible !
my friend ordered a chicken shawarma and also said it was n't good .
went here in search of a falafel fix .
what i found was a place whose falafel is in need of a fix .
it was sad .
the set-up here is a bit awkward , too .
the good reviews are long gone .
the food is terrible .
the absolute worst excuse for a gyro i have ever had .
where 's the meat , and no feta .
slimy mayo covers the lettuce and tomato .
garbage .
i 've eaten at the pita house on several occasions over the years .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
the food i 've had here has generally been bland .
this time i had the gyro salad .
the meat was just ok .
the dressing was just boring .
i have never gotten the sense that anyone who works here cares .
the dressing was not very good either .
one of the worst experiences we have had in scottsdale .
food is terrible !
i just payed my _num_ $ and left .
every time i come here the service is really bad .
the hookah service is a little better , but not by much .
when we received the food they both had salad , no fries !
anyways , i wo n't be returning here after tonight !
slow service .
poor ambience .
will not come back here .
also , chairs are dirty .
if you are going to sell the smallest gyro , it better be amazing .
the menu 's are old and not all items can still be read .
table near us complained numerous times over less than desirable service .
it took _num_ minutes for one of the worst meals ever .
this is a place that deserves to not stay in business .
i looked at her and said `` ok , can i see it '' ?
it was the worst experience of my life .
do n't eat the chicken !
macadamia nut crusted chicken .
i 'm not into sushi .
kona grill , come off it !
and my stomach was upset for about four hours after i ate it .
and our waitress took about _num_ minutes to bring us our check .
ick .
this is where you go to learn how sushi can go wrong .
it 's ok , but beware .
rice is not right either .
stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup .
yet , it was still _num_ minutes to even get our drink order taken .
now the dumb ass had admitted she 's not busy .
he also orders miso soup as an appetizer .
no soup .
yes , he ate it and the empty bowl it was so good .
for a signature dish , it was just okay .
chicken done nicely , but could have used a little more of the chutney .
server again disappeared in between my husband 's plate being removed and my finishing .
i really do n't like this particular kona grill .
average ( rail / draft ) price $ _num_ .
not a fan .
either way , wo n't be eating there again .
ick .
nothing special .
all i ate was the bbq chicken pizza and thought it was tasty .
our server was one of the worst i have ever experienced .
he was in a foul mood and took it out on everyone .
but i 'm not in a hurry to return .
it was ok , but nothing special .
however , this time it did n't cut the mustard .
there 's was n't anything .
went across to yard house , much better .
no serious complaints , but still not great and stellar .
we ordered the basil pesto linguine , the chefs salad and various sushi .
the flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out .
typical mall restaurant , average food for above average prices .
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
what a disappointment .
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
avoid this place yelper 's , avoid it .
i had about _num_ minutes left and ordered as much as i can .
the lemon drop , which was recommended by the waitress was horrible .
potstickers : pan seared chicken , it was pretty good .
crab crunch and special roll .
it 's like ordering fish at a burger place !
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .
perhaps had i ordered a different entree i would have had a better experience .
it was a _num_ min wait .
too bad .
i am not a fan of this place .
it has the worst sushi rolls and drinks are n't even that cheap .
your beer special is a $ _num_ miller lite ?
skip this place and go elsewhere to spend your money .
it 's american food in the worst sense big island meat loaf ?
oh just die already .
gross .
when my sushi arrived the bartender brought out the soy sauce .
about two bites in he received his chicken meal .
all of this has been delivered about five minutes after ordering .
and to top it off the guy could have cared less .
this goes for my boyfriend as well .
so , maybe that makes us individually spoiled in some way ?
disgusting .
it was awful .
i ca n't believe this last of quality was delivered at fashion square .
i 've eaten at this kona grill several times .
but i 'm really disappointed with it and not going back .
the miso soup seems like its from a dry mix .
aka fresher fish , better ingredients , and superior preparation .
try : sushi creek : if you do n't mind a drive .
the service was terrible , and i got food poisoning .
too bad she has to work with horrible people .
whats even worse is the the `` manager '' actually did it .
too expensive for what you get .
we sat down outside on the patio ... waited _num_ minutes to get menus .
ok , i understand , if they were busy , which they we not .
ok , ordered drinks , then food .
here is where stuff gets bad .
_num_ minutes later , we get our food .
_num_ sushi roll , and i chicken wrap .
_num_ minutes .
i was not expecting anything other than good food and average service .
average service would have made this review _num_ starts , .
but i guess shame on me for just looking for average service in scottsdale .
he responded `` i guess '' with a bad face !
_num_ bad servers in one sitting not good !
calamari was awful .
beer was cold !
service was terrible .
food was n't great , either ( we barely touched half of it ) .
_num_ stars for the food , _num_ for the service .
miso soup was not what we remembered but sushi and pad thai were good .
the food is great but the service is horrible !
it took us forever just to get a refill of water .
the man did not stop her .
it just seemed really inappropriate .
they make you feel like you 're wasting their time .
food was good , service was horrible .
the avocado egg rolls were filled w/ just avocado , and no seasoning .
it 's built more for ambiance than food quality .
this once is poorly managed .
the staff is not trained on the rules .
not impressed .
he could not be bothered .
we asked for our money back and will not be visiting again .
there is very little fish on the rolls compared to other sushi places .
like _num_ % rice .
blew me away that is a $ _num_ roll ?
just hard to recommend when the sushi is so ridiculously small and overpriced .
walked in the restaurant from the mall entrance and you could smell fish .
we should 've walked out , but we did n't .
not personal at all .
bathrooms were super dirty and were n't stocked .
overall , we 'll never return and we should have went elsewhere .
went there with my bf and was not thrilled .
the veggies with the sea bass were inedible .
two tables of patrons in the whole restaurant but no patrick .
no patrick .
lousy , lousy manager .
on the way out , we met manager nick .
worthless sushi .
i ca n't believe the kind of sushi these people get away with .
took too long .
sushi was not fresh .
do not order sushi here !
the rest of the food is also bad we tried several items .
horrific service .
i am still sitting at bar after _num_ minutes .
drinks gone , food gone .
this is not the first time .
but this time it was horrible .
no real reason on why .
but that is okay with me she was rude to begin with anyways .
sorry it 's a bit late .
it breaks my heart that their food , their sushi is not good .
its depressing .
on the saturday night , it had an entire section closed off .
the food was low quality .
there is a problem .
this restaurant has a problem .
i wish it did not .
unless you 're going for happy hour i would definitely advise avoiding this restaurant .
i 've given it several tries and have been disappointed every time .
the juice even made the fries soggy !
they got cold really fast .
maybe the burger and i were n't a good match today ... .
she would have to pass by and threw a glance at us .
also , the girl who sat us in was also very disinterested .
service was busy at the time , but it was off nonetheless .
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
my boyfriend got _num_ rolls , all of them were disgusting .
i got the chicken satay thinking that would be safe .
i seriously just sat there hungry the whole time .
we finally got the check and he did n't even take the chicken off .
selection was limited and the styles were all ghetto .
not a dam sales associate greets or even help out .
i 'll probably just try a whole bunch of shoes on .
one star is too high .
very pushy and not customer friendly at all !
ew , this place has gotten so cheesy , or has it always been ?
she said the description is for a different one that is n't the picture .
that did n't even make sense .
is she stupid !
terrible services !
once i pay mine off , i will not use it again .
then , you ca n't even pay with a debit card .
just cash or check only .
very long waits to try on clothing and pay .
i 've worked in costumer service so i tried to be polite .
most of the girls that work at this location have the worst customer service .
every time i come here i 'm annoyed by the girl that helps me .
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
usually never have a bad experience here , usually really nice girls .
i hope i never run into her again .
sadly , i must say i am disappointed with my main bank .
and told me to stop complaining or he would throw me out .
i had to say something ( in attempts to represent us customers ) .
if i could leave zero stars i would .
i will never step foot into this branch again .
drinks are expensive , but i expected that .
the club itself is ok and deserves _num_ stars .
it 's the male bartender that really brought the rating down .
i would give negative stars if i could .
left a few messages for management to `` discuss my visit . ''
nothing special about this place .
felt like i was in a bad part of phoenix or something .
very trashy .
terrible .
not my kind of club .
the food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah .
bad move .
first off , the bread they brought us was disappointing to say the least .
i decided to visit this location as i was already headed to whole foods .
are n't you being paid to work ?
it would n't have been so bad at that point .
hey , mistakes happen .
the front desk had horrible communication problems .
i 'd know , this happened to my friends and i .
i have no clue .
was not at all impressed with this hotel .
while the lobby is renovated , the rooms are extremely dated .
the staff was n't overly polite .
i guess anyone who has to go to work is just out of luck .
outside of that , i 'd suggest staying anywhere else .
manager did not offer solution just that person was new and made a mistake .
now i must wait _num_ days to get my money back .
okay , so normally i like courtyard hotels a lot !
pretty gross .
the bathroom area is nothing special .
c'mon marriott .
this baja fresh really did n't impress me .
no problem with my drink .
there 's no indoor seating .
no drive-thru option .
zero indoor seating !
the staff is not that friendly and they all seem to look quite dirty .
the lines can be very long - i do n't know why !
this is the worst starbucks i 've ever been to .
they never get my drink right and they can never make a good drink .
every shot they pull is old by the time they use it .
i got a vanilla latte a couple minutes ago : it 's bitter .
probably the worst customer service i have gotten from a starbucks .
generally hit and miss on your drink order at this starbucks .
honestly , the mornings are very dependable , but afternoons are disappointing .
generally the afternoons have the most inexperienced and poorly trained staff .
the main barista ( afternoons ) generally lacks in quality control .
the store was so dirty we almost left .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
this place have such a bad customer service .
maybe they should hire new mornings workers .
told me he could replace the battery , but would n't set the calendar .
it 's not that tough .
i was immediately disappointed with this hotel .
bad , bad , bad ... .
the guest service agents were not friendly nor welcoming .
totally disappointed in this hotel .
no continental breakfast for $ _num_ a night ?
i would say just an okay hotel , not great .
i would not recommend this hotel .
do n't stay here .
this property is desperately in need of an update .
a corner jet tub bizarre layout .
very disappointed diamond member .
the room smells bad .
the attendants downstairs were not friendly .
do n't recommend .
suffice to stay , this is not a great place to stay .
one would think that in scottsdale , they would at least provide drinking glasses .
however , my bed is awful .
my towels were dirty with brown spots all over it .
the front staff were horribly rude and unhelpful .
however the staff left me quite wanting .
this was quite frustrating because i had planned to come in late .
my version of arizona does n't include this style .
okay , perhaps _num_ is a slight ( gross ? )
lynn needs to go flip burgers for a living !
not an honest person .
it 's just not worth the money ... .
so you do n't want us to sit at your table ?
it came out with less than a cup of pasta and no veggies .
it was good , but nothing special , and there was no spice whatsoever .
we will not be back .
our waiter was extremely rushed .
my $ _num_ valued groupon now felt like it was worth much less .
needless to say , we were furious .
and they also would n't allow us to order any of the specials either .
dh & i came to bravo bistro tonight .
we had terrible service , we waited for _num_ minutes before receiving menus .
dh 's marinara sauce tasted like ragu sauce .
the marsala sauce was very bland .
the bruschetta bread was soggy .
this is the exception .
we went to bravo bistro excited based on the few things we had read .
the crackers were one variety of the most generic kind .
terrible .
i did n't even really know what to think .
this should have served as a warning ... a very obvious warning .
totally bland .
needless to say , we skipped desert .
total bill for total sh*t and _num_ glasses of chianti ... $ _num_ .
this place sucks , do not go there .
i do n't even feel better after writing this .
bought a groupon and tried this place out after reading mixed reviews .
how do you have bad bread ?
nothing special , nothing to go out of your way for .
i ordered the linguini in clam sauce .
adequate portion but sauce was tasteless .
no garlic flavor , watery and bland .
the stuffed eggplant was also bland .
but our portions were quite small and the dishes overpriced .
my chicken marsala was alright , but still stingy , even with the sauce .
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
overall , we were pretty unimpressed with this restaurant .
i 've never had such terrible service .
went on a friday night , but there was no hostess on duty .
and i could them wandering around at the bar not actually doing anything .
everytime one walked past our table he turned his head and avoided eye contact .
nobody came by to check to see if the food was ok .
i wo n't be going back .
i bought _num_ groupons for this restaurant & our 1st experience was horrible .
we ordered _num_ appetizers and a bottle of wine .
they apparently lay it on a grill and forget it !
would not recommend with or without a groupon , overpriced and not good food !
needless to say , i went into this expecting a positive experience .
shortly after placing the order we were informed that there was no chicken .
it was bland , rubbery , uninspired , and $ _num_ !
in conclusion , this business deserves to fail .
their food is of poor quality and high cost .
they were out of the signature osso buco .
avoid this place at all costs !
if i could give zero stars , i would .
he called me ugly and said that i am wearing black like his asshole .
i canceled my order , worse on-line experience i have had .
had the worst restaurant experience , ever , at this establishment .
the food is not worth the price .
the entrees were not impressive .
the enchilada sauce did n't bring out any flavor to the dish .
the pollo margarita was stuffed chicken breast with cheese and peppers .
the chicken was sooooo dry .
for $ _num_ , i was expecting to eat excellent chicken .
eh , not a good restaurant .
i believe i have had a better meal at an airport .
the margaritas , i am sure , are made from a mix .
bottom line , do not eat at tortilla factory .
this place is a joke , the food is bland .
the santa fe roll was weird .
the flavor was just weird .
the ribs were okay , and were served room temperature .
i did n't know what to do with them .
i could n't find the stuffing in my stuffed filet mignon .
sorry , but i wo n't come back .
the cons : the rest of the food is pretty mediocre .
service was not so good for a slow night .
the tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing .
the taste was not anything out of this world like i expected .
i could n't even taste the crab .
the salsa was the worst though .
i think pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff .
maybe they accidentally served us ragu .
_num_ stars overall .
_num_ stars for the tortillas .
ever see the _num_ girls , _num_ cup video ?
it 's that bad .
the worst ( in every way ) restaurant i have ever been to .
and i 'm _num_ years old .
complete rip off , dont believe the hype .
everything else was just edible .
but , the service and the food , um , not so much .
the pasta my daughter had was very oily .
my pollo margarita was dry and almost tasteless .
overall , a disappointment .
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
flour tortillas and red pepper ( ? )
not bad , but for sure not worth the carbs .
there are many great mexican places in scottsdale , so skip this one .
as i walked in , i was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry .
maybe the worst tortilla i 've ever had !
shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable .
each individual item was quite bland .
and the plain flour tortillas were nothing special .
the atmosphere is cool , but the food stinks .
first time ai n't half bad , the second time was pretty awful .
i went here last week and had a really blah experience .
but what i hate is bad service .
could n't get our bill right either .
better luck next time !
disappointing .
wrong .
this place is only for cocktails on the patio for the nice local .
do n't get me started on the staff !
completely forgettable mexican food .
i do n't even want to give this dump the one star !
they deserve _num_ !
worst place ever !
three months before the wedding , i confirmed the prices that were quoted .
nasty .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy !
it could 've been great , but it was nowhere near good .
i will skip this place next time i am in the area .
we asked for things , like waters , that never came .
methinks that i 'd much rather have chips and salsa !
this disappointment of a dish cost about $ _num_ .
it takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon .
i 've had better margaritas at places with better menus .
if your planning to eat , go elsewhere !
however , that 's about where it ends from our experience .
the taste was sour , burnt , and harsh .
not the subtle spice and flavor of a good mole .
the presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad .
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
even the salsa was lacking .
if you are looking for good mexican food , do n't look here .
why could n't they push _num_ tables together for us ?
as a former restaurant manager , i understand how seating is managed .
needless to say , i will not ever return .
the food was virtually inedible .
the problem was that was about all that was great about the place .
horrible , horrible , horrible !
i did n't even understand it .
i ordered mole ribs , and the were inedible .
`` your food tastes flavorless '' ?
since it was _num_ degrees , we sat inside .
we ordered chips and salsa for $ _num_ .
the menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey .
$ _num_ for two a la cart tacos .
the fish tacos were under seasoned portions of mahi mahi .
the fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste .
the sauce was very tasty , the meatloaf was tender and not dry .
it just began to turn my stomach .
it just became mush .
for three of us , the tab totaled over $ _num_ before tip .
that included _num_ bud lights , which were cold and refreshing .
glass , and was mediocre .
it 's plain condescending .
that 's `` sir '' , or the name on my gold card .
that 's why you got a _num_ % tip tonight .
the food left much to be desired .
the margarita chicken was dry and had little flavor .
the ribs were worse .
the texture was strange and they were tasteless .
i was really disappointed since the atmosphere is so neat .
the food was bland across the board .
the dish describes veggies in the pasta , but little was seen .
the drinks were ok , but tasted like sprite was added to the margaritas .
a party of _num_ would have been booked well in advance .
i ordered the pollo margarita which was a little dry , but good .
the potato thing was nasty .
so this is _num_ star reviewed for the second time in a row .
tonight , our service was well below mediocre .
my wife 's salad had cold , overcooked shrimp .
our other dinner guest ate only half his carne dish .
which is unfortunate , because they usually have a good product .
last night though , i think i 'd had it .
what a mistake .
tasted like crap so she switched to cabernet .
my pork chili verde was tough with gristle running through it .
pure garbage .
i returned it and ordered the chicken pasta .
more garbage .
cold , no flavor , runny cheese sauce and hardly any chicken .
terrible - no flavor , cold .
i did n't find out until this morning that she hated them .
the tortillas they brag about were cold and tasteless .
the chips were stale .
this place is horrible - go somewhere else .
service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
this was served along side some red pepper tortillas with jalapeno butter .
the chicken underneath was moist , and the accompanying relish was quite tasty .
the pork was dry , the sauce was watery , the potatoes undercooked .
but the food was n't worth the cost .
nasty .
bathrooms a mess - water all over the floor and trash overflowing .
tables covered with vinyl .
we ordered appetizers - nothing special .
bottom line : wo n't be coming here again .
and i highly recommend both the locals and tourists to avoid this place .
they gave us a tortilla separately with a cheese butter .
the red sauce on the red enchilada sauce tasted like very bitter vinegar .
the drinks were too weak , what is advertised as hot is not .
the service was awful , which should have been my first sign .
the margaritas were watered down .
oh , and parking sucks too .
do not eat here .
she brought me gf tortillas but it was too late .
and was extremely sick .
and salsa are not free .
if i could give a negative star review , i would .
this was one of the worst restaurants i have ever eaten at ... .
she was told not at all ... .
unfortunately , we wo n't be back .
i was disappointed in our experience .
gross !
this place does not even deserve a star .
we still had to wait _num_ minutes for a table .
this was the worst mexican restaurant i 've ever been to .
a tortilla factory and you only make flour tortillas in one size ?
not only was the food a disappointment but the place was a dump .
skip this place and old town all together .
only a _num_ because of the great atmosphere .
unfortunately the food was terrible .
the chili verde was nearly inedible .
hate to say it , but the service was horrible !
the food was okay , i 've had way better mexican food !
the food was bland and needed salt .
the service was very slow and the waitress was not attentive .
the chips and salsa were just fine .
nothing to rave about .
which was sort of like a bowl of enchilada sauce .
i would n't recommend it .
my husband had the pork chili verde and it was not good .
the pork was fatty and more like pork soup .
i 'm not sure it contained any tequila .
horrible !
it 's not that hard to make a fresh margarita !
overall , we found no good mexican food in scottsdale area .
also , walk around the property .
the nachos here , were made with more gourmet ingredients .
skip the old town tortilla factory !
chicken quesadilla was okay but i 've had better .
just a warning for those of you looking for a great mexican meal .
very disappointed in food and margaritas .
mahi mahi tacos smelly and not fresh .
green pork chile more potatoes than pork and very runny just in a broth .
i 'm giving this place _num_ stars because of the value .
it was good mexican but not for the prices they charge .
the total for _num_ entrees and a few beers was $ _num_ .
i do n't feel like the meal was worth any where near that .
drive over to new mexico to get proper chile verde .
the ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought .
disappointing .
these tasted bagged and almost stale , though the salsa was good .
the margaritas taste like a whole lot of water and no alcohol .
they are the low fat kind you buy from the grocery store .
oh and you have to pay almost $ _num_ for chips and salsa .
i waited over _num_ minutes for my entree .
do yourself a favor and skip on this restaurant .
we have opted to spend our hard earned money elsewhere .
the food was just mediocre ; not enough spice and flavor .
i wish i had eaten only the black bean tortillas and butter !
the steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold .
the mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well .
the guacamole was ok for my tastes with cilantro and jalapeos in it .
with a creamy sauce like alfredo in it .
not at all like what i would expect .
a pork chop with one bite out of it .
children were upset , adults disappointed .
my wife approached the manager and said this is n't right .
( not counting this dinner ) .
they do n't want to create satisfied guests every time .
my waiter was friendly enough but the food was just ok .
it just looked kinda strange and the fish was n't all that fresh .
maybe it 's me but it just was n't what i expected .
in all honesty ... _num_ star might be overrated .
i rarely write reviews , but this restaurant needs to step up their game !
waited - over _num_ minutes ... after a reservations was made .
food was awful .
drink were awful .
service was spotty as well .
very disappointing .
however , the service was just short of horrendous .
it is crying out for some basic server training and management .
and then it took over _num_ minutes after we ordered the food to arrive .
the taste was pretty bland .
we were hungry and we still could not like the food .
none of us in our group will go back there again .
the salsa was tasteless , the salmon was gross and the ribs were worse .
not a fan !
the shrimp was good but everything else i barely ate any of .
i have no desire to return here .
he was rude , not our fault they sat us there .
wow were they bad .
when our main courses arrived , they looked ok , but tasted awful .
i had a steak and my wife had shrimp tacos .
this is a tourist trap full of less than mediocre food .
go for drinks , dine elsewhere .
do not try the black bean tortillas !
horrible !
i was very disappointed as i have been wanting to eat here for years .
regardless , avoid at all costs !
the queso fundido came out with a texture more like soup than melted cheese .
i would not order it again .
terrible spices .
just a mess .
it really was n't worth it .
no big deal .
by the time i got back , we still did n't have a server .
we sat there for nearly _num_ minutes before i was going to say something .
when he came back , hers was not frozen .
we asked for both with no sour cream .
when they arrived at the table , both had sour cream on top .
i asked for some ... never came to the table .
it was literally one thing after another all night long .
we had already consumed two margaritas each , and did n't want another one .
hopefully the next item i go everything runs smoothly .
would n't go back .
then ordered chips and salsa ; we 've had better .
it tasted like what you would think was boiled rubber !
no flavor , tough as shoe leather i could n't eat it .
i had no idea one could find mexican food this disappointing in arizona .
the tortilla bread service with butter was the highlight .
not inexpensive but not outrageous .
i was forced to even give this _num_ star to post a review .
food was over priced , terrible and it took over an hour .
no flavor , extremely bland .
service was terrible .
the chips were cold and a bit stale .
the food came out barely warm .
this is sin for mexican .
most everything was on the bland side and appeared to be not freshly prepared .
the specialty tortillas were flour not corn .
and do n't make them from scratch .
so a mexican dish ended up costing $ _num_ .
when we pointed this out they took $ _num_ off our bill .
super disappointed with this place as it has potential .
so changed to nachos , but no cheese on them .
but if it was , it was watered down with sour cream .
we were excited to come to this place but it turned to be disappointing .
i will not be coming back .
my green enchiladas were good but small in portion size for $ _num_ .
dirty looks from at least _num_ people .
if i return , i think i might go during the day .
this is not one i would recommend .
the food is n't that good and the margaritas are watered down .
the food is incredibly bland .
the prices are unreasonable for the portions and quality of food .
certainly no intention to return .
one star because zero was n't an option .
i ca n't believe a place like this is in business .
i 've never had such bad food at a restaurant .
the service was fine , but the food was just so bad .
the food is terrible and not worth the money .
we were disappointed with our overall experience .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the red enchiladas lacked flavor and we could not finish it .
lots of things to add , shrimp , chicken and steak .
for the price the food was less than we anticipated .
the concierge at our hotel recommended the tortilla factory but what a disappointment .
the guacamole was nothing to write home about .
the homemade tortillas were good , not amazing .
wow - such horribly disappointing mexican food .
the salsa was truly the worst i 've every had .
completely , utterly , bland and watery .
it was just yuck .
zero stars for that .
very disappointed !
we ordered the chicken monterey , build your tacos , along with green enchiladas .
chicken monterey was dry and lacked a lot of flavor .
when i added the table salsa , it made it worse .
the shrimp had no flavor along with the chicken and meat .
the whole table agreed , we all would n't go back .
do n't arrive too close to closing time !
we showed up last night _num_ minutes before the posted closing time .
unfortunately , we will never return .
not impressed .
the margaritas are watered down .
there is n't a point of paying $ _num_ for one .
the food was n't anything great .
the food was over priced and not anything like mexican food .
the guacamole was watered down and looked like green chile hot sauce .
my husband and i would n't not recommend this restaurant .
service was good but the food was extremely lacking .
basically over americanized food that is way over priced .
the meat tasted and looked like it had been frozen .
other _num_ had the chicken enchiladas , they smelled like cat food .
we have never done that before and we eat out together once a week !
so disappointed .
but that was nothing compared to the haircut .
i had the worst haircut of my life from the steven paul salon .
i had the absolute worst experience at steven paul salon .
i called steven paul himself and left him a message to make him aware .
he did not return my call either .
however , i was mortified to be in public .
my mistake .
i ca n't even give this place _num_ star .
methinks not is damn right .
i rescheduled an appointment for her to fix it .
i was sick and did n't show up , which i called and apologized .
i barely left the house that month .
worst place ever !
the salon was not good neither the treatment of the manager .
was the worst behavior i got in scottsdale salon .
the staff was awful , rude and not approachable .
sat there for _num_ hours with my new born in a dirty waiting room .
never once did our doctor try to get to know our daughter .
they all appear to hate their job .
one week later and still nothing .
needless to say , we will definitely not be going back .
, and are very rude in the process .
they have definitely lost ours .
the office staff gets zero stars .
i left this office shortly after my daughters _num_ month check up .
do not use this company !
i have called the owner several times with no return phone call .
she also called me sue ... not my name .
no one seems to care about what there doing .
this company is very unprofessional .
if they do cancel they do not leave voicemail to cover their end .
in the end poor customer service , no courtesy calls , and poor information .
they apparently tried but could not get into the gate on a holiday .
waited _num_ days and called them back .
so , i called them back today to cancel my service .
it seems like you see the same people there all the time .
also , do n't get a table there .
overall , i would n't go to this place during the weekend .
i would n't say this is my favorite place to go out .
if i had a top ten list , it 'd be closer to _num_ .
i have only been there once for like _num_ minutes .
they were playing awesome music though .
its just that every single miserable person inside _num_ kind of sucks .
maybe i like to hate too .
good thing i 'm getting too old for this place .
it would be nice that the dim lighting was turned up one more notch .
so , discuss on where you 're going to next before you go in .
the night i went i thought the dj was actually spinning pretty well .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , and she did n't know how to make anything .
seriously peeps ... a country boy like me ... .
review is for food only , not service , which was fine .
went here as i was in a rush .
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
the bread is tasteless and light , sort of like styrofoam .
as with the meat , they put only a small cut on each sandwich .
just an awful meal .
everyone burns a pizza ... it happens .
i 'm not sure why i 'm giving it _num_ stars instead of _num_ .
then the after taste was over cooked butter and bad garlic .
cheese and butter make an awful combo .
i wish the butter and horrible garlic were n't on there .
i 'm mean it was so bad i could n't eat it .
it said it had pine nuts , arugula , red onions and red peppers .
ok you picture it loaded with pine nuts , onions and peppers .
i maybe saw _num_ things of onion .
it was a very strong flavor that was overpowering and bad , real bad .
it was a really bad meal .
it was soggy , and tasted like a wet foot .
if you use quality mozzarella its not like that .
horrible service .
we received _num_ pizzas that were way over cooked : burnt .
reading other reviews on yelp and google : seems to be a running theme .
however , with this run of poor service , i will never go back .
the eggplant parmigiana was sadly a very different story .
of the cheesy ( pun intended ) service from the female server .
i went on sunday around _num_ and the place was completely dead .
i love wood fired pizza and was excited to give theirs a try .
however , i am a food snob .
i have been wanting to go here for a while and finally went tonight .
this is the area grazie seriously lacks .
here is the problem .
i understand the cheap labor that is available in arizona but , come on .
again showing the lack of care and preparation .
for being in old town it should be better .
this is not one of them .
it did n't have a lot of flavor and not enough toppings .
it would n't come close to my top ten pizza places in the city .
not a fan of the food but maybe i went on an off night .
at present with a _num_ star review i feel this place is way overrated .
the calzone was a hot pile of salty awful .
and it was more expensive than the parlor .
quality control needs work at this place , we wont be going back .
too bad ... .
unfortunately , my experience with this restaurant was very disappointing .
although a little confused , we all obliged and waited outside of the restaurant .
_num_ minutes later , still no table .
it was a shame because we were really looking forward to dining there .
the day before our dinner , we had one more decide to join us .
i called the restaurant back , requesting that we add one more .
in addition , we asked for the heater to be turned on again ... .
not once was there an apology for the service received .
maybe this is n't `` your '' kind of establishment '' .
the service was horrible !
the margarita pizza tasted like it had canned tomato sauce on it .
wine list was great , however i would say service was absent .
the food here was rather disappointing .
her reply was simply , `` oh , sorry about that '' .
but no !
the platter was not mentioned after that .
too grossed out to go back .
we would have preferred one of your daughters for a big table like ours !
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
yet i was asked why i did not have reservations .
just nasty .
beyond disgusting .
worst part is that they charge $ _num_ for the damn thing !
do n't ask , just make it happen , ok ?
the sauce was more of a bland paste than a sauce .
but with two servers for the entire place , what did we expect ?
twice with family ( they picked the restaurant , once with my fiancee ) .
all this over an insulting _num_ minute period ?
not so at grazie .
nothing matches up .
terrible .
a hint that they use cheap cheese .
waited again over _num_ minutes for anyone to even give us menus .
however , we managed , and ate .
he avoided my eyes and of course never approached our table !
we ordered a bottle of wine , salad , and a pizza .
whatever the girls were talking about was apparently more important than the customers .
i went to grazie with my family , visiting from out of town .
it was cold out that eve so i requested the front door be closed .
not a very accommodating voice or comment .
we , and the other patrons ate pizza with our coats on .
the pizza is n't as good as it used to be .
have gone there about _num_ times over the last years .
but this has really gone down hill .
every table was covered with dirty dishes and food .
our pizza was horrible .
i am sorry for the harsh review but it was really that bad .
have gone there about _num_ times over the last years .
but this has really gone down hill .
the pizza was good , but the service was slow .
i would not go back despite the pizza being good .
the whole experience was worse than disappointing .
nine dollars for a nearly inedible plate of food .
it was about as bad a dining experience as i can imagine .
our salad was missing a couple ingredients , the cucumbers and peppers .
the sangria just tasted like cheap sangria , nothing special .
the bread we ordered was plain and boring .
our pizza crust was burnt and flavorless .
she did n't take it off our bill or offer anything for us .
bread was cold .
sangria was more juice less wine .
overall , avoid it .
we came with a groupon , and received the worst service .
she barely gave us attention the rest of our visit there .
food brought _num_ minutes after arriving for reservation .
salad dressing never provided .
believe the reviews on service & do n't risk a special event here .
this place get negative stars !
i had to pick one star but it does n't even earn one .
we arrived on a sunday evening , there were _num_ other tables seated .
we ordered a large salad for _num_ to split with dressing on the side .
_num_ minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on .
_num_ minutes later our pizza came .
we never got refills and no one checked on us .
we planned on just letting him know what happened and we were disappointed .
i will never return here and i will tell people not to go here .
we had a horrible experience tonight .
i was with my friend and her mom and the service was horrible .
avoid at all costs ... .
just gone done with a birthday dinner here for my cousin .
ready for my two cents ?
my client told me about this place not to long ago .
my boyfriend and i went for date night .
no hot sauce or ranch ?
horrible customer service .
had the worst experience here ever .
i have been going to grazie on and off for at least _num_ years .
after tonight 's service i will never be going back .
this place has really gone downhill .
after all that , she brought us _num_ glasses of very cold sangria .
owner : a very rude man .
and your business is going downhill ?
ok i 'm done .
worst experience we have ever had .
no bread or clean plates after the salad .
the platter was massive and well presented however the cheeses were boring .
luckily , i do have a pizza cutter so it worked out .
all in all it was not what i expected .
so we ask to have no olives , add tomatoes instead ) .
about _num_ minutes goes by and she comes out with our pizza .
we did only tell her once that we would like them .
worst service i have received in a long time .
then our server switched , but failed to tell the new server our order .
do n't waste your time .
disappointing .
her feeling were hurt and she left the restaurant crying .
will not be back .
i have never had such terrible service as we received at this place .
the waitress gave us total attitude about using them .
_num_ hours for pizza and dessert is nuts !
the waitress gave us attitude the entire time .
gross !
she then offered to take half off the pizza .
he did n't even acknowledge us .
but no .
almost ... this thing should have been done _num_ minutes ago !
one thing i noticed is also how bad the pizza looked !
there were several slices that were not worth eating !
absolutely the worst slow service .
food is mediocre .
the restaurant is not that crowded and does not look understaffed .
very painful when you have a starving _num_ year old .
the only good thing i experienced at this restaurant was the gluten-free crust pizza .
i will not go back .
i hate to give this place a bad review .
the pizza was decent but at $ _num_ , i sort of expected better .
with a drink and tip , i spent over $ _num_ .
service was slow , i think because there was only one person working .
pizza was burnt also and looked like something from restaurant nightmare .
sorry just think this is weird and unprofessional .
pizza was the worst !
ordered margherita pizza _num_ go ... had one ( _num_ ) piece of basil !
$ _num_ ?
no one was rushing us so i remembered thinking it was pretty good .
so my memory was either bad or they have changed .
first of all there was a dog in the restaurant .
plus the place was like almost empty .
i do n't know how they are still even open .
save your _num_ hours and money .
no grazie for us again !
worst dining experience ever i decided for first time to write a review .
disappointing evening at grazie .
pizza margherita had no basil and was very bland and mushy .
and the service was poor and rude .
used to be our favorite pizza destination , but no longer !
had such a ridiculous experience this evening , all we could do was laugh .
completely awful service , although burnt the food was still good .
horribly slow service on a saturday night .
my advice is to get more staff , especially on the weekends .
they would not remove the money from our bill and were extremely rude .
it clearly was not the vegetable pizza i was expecting .
food was awful at best .
very bland cardboard .
the staff did apologize and comp _num_ pizza and offered a dessert .
oh i forgot , when they brought out the kabob .
will not recommend or return .
the problem is the kitchen .
i 'm still so confused about this place .
my husband and children took me to grazie 's last night for my birthday .
it took a long time to get our salads .
then she said `` you can just not tip me then ! ''
horrible service , good food .
ate , asked for check , and again a lengthy wait .
the onions were overly sweet like sugar had been added .
our water glasses were not refilled .
frankly , we do n't know what the explanation is for this poor experience .
one man , most likely the owner , doing everything .
waiting tables and cooking .
and the pizzas were just mediocre .
i 'm a former resident , i lived at this property for _num_ years .
i did get a brand new washer and dryer for my unit , though .
the downstairs units are horrid for one major reason .
i mean every step .
bad business !
i would n't recommend living in this place .
-they did n't toast my bagel and it made me cry .
- you have to share a room .
- the nurses argue .
do you need more pain meds ? '
this place is an absolute joke !
he never came back with the pain meds he promised .
not sure why all the high reviews for er .
of course there will be adjustments made through insurance , but my lord .
no wonder such a screwed up med system .
i could barely walk or stand up straight when i got there .
i ask for ice chips , sorry not until we get ct results .
i 'm not a human , just a long line of cattle to brand .
not a call , not a survey , not even by mail .
so here 's your survey : your ed has gone downhill .
you are really not helping anyone anymore .
i went home with severe back pain feeling like i was guilty of something .
so i decided to visit this shit hole of a place aka the hospital .
and i never come to the er for pain i just deal with it .
the nurses was just sitting around like it 's nothing to do .
because the longer you stay in the room the higher your bill .
save your money call your primary at least they care .
it was bizarre .
i wish i could say _num_ stars .
there was only _num_ other person in the er waiting room .
they let him sit there for _num_ hours .
until he said f it this is taking far too long .
they 're rude , terrible service , terrible attitudes .
my experience was that the nurses at the shea location were top notch .
i could not understand my doctor at all .
no wake up call .
next time i think the courtyard marriott might be in order .
fortunately , our apartment paid for us and our dogs to say .
needless to say it has been a very stressful occasion .
the stay at the holiday inn made it a little better .
this took me off guard of course .
they can thank you for the low rating .
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
we only stayed one night and left early .
a pawn shop and chicken & waffles .
food was alright ... but not up to par with the price .
never going back !
well , now i know why it 's been so long .
jen was our waitress who was very polite and professional .
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
would i go back ... eh ... most likely not .
coming back with the drinks , the server ( allison , i think ? )
i do wish she would have stopped by and acknowledged the issue .
`` sorry , i got busy and forgot to put in your order . ''
not going back there again or any red lobster !
there are other flavors besides butter and garlic .
this food was horrible .
the feeling lasted for _num_ hours until i was finally able to fall asleep .
she brought my little niece who we were also celebrating her birthday .
there was no broth .
she said that she would go and find my lost meal .
about another _num_ minutes and she brought it .
i have a few friends living here and the place is just too big .
parking is a headache with a five floor gated parking garage .
they recently renovated the pool area .
the motto here is hate where you live .
worst management ever .
did not enjoy living here .
a very badly designed residential complex .
loud garage if you live next to it .
also , not one front office person still works there from when i started .
they said it was not an issue and that they would provide the space .
this was a major issue they did n't allow me to move in conveniently .
this is completely unacceptable .
would n't recommend to most .
i also almost had my car towed for parking in my spot .
very noisy if you yourself are n't going out drinking .
there are better places , it 's expensive for such poor quality of staff .
rude office ladies all the time .
if i could give zero stars i would .
nothing wrong with that , but they should describe it for what it is .
moving out of this place is hell .
my dog is suffering .
the parking garage is a whole other disaster in itself .
this location is so slow .
i have sat in the drive through for _num_ minutes , multiple times .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
then he walked off .
tacky .
i 'd give this place _num_ or negative stars , if i could .
i guess it 's the man in charge on the evening i went .
ok , so maybe i 'm coming off a bit strong here .
i want nothing to do with a place like this .
just leave me out of it .
cheap drinks , cheap furnishings , cheap women ( whoa !
the food is not worth mentioning - except perhaps the hush puppies .
for your own safety do not go to the bathroom here .
`` you 're better than that . ''
nope , not so much .
somehow this still does n't work that well .
it was basically just a stop in while heading from one place to another .
why else would one go ?
this place is such a pile of shit .
absolute worst bar service i 've ever received .
damn another bar with no kitchen ?
does this place ever get cleaned ?
ok bar food , basic frozen items fried .
holy crap are they slow .
today was _num_ mins for chicken fingers and fries .
the only good thing about this place is the extremely cheap beer .
man , i got to stop hanging out in scottsdale .
is there a negative number for review ?
had a horrible experience in this bar/restaurant today .
sure enough , the nasty girl - erica , was our waitress .
when we asked for another waitress , she refused .
it is a horrible place .
busy , but not standing room only .
i went and sat down at the bar and ordered _num_ drinks .
the guy comes over and says `` that 'll be _num_ dollars '' .
yes , it 's cheap .
there is n't a single reason to settle for horrible service .
the wings were n't even trimmed !
gross !
the second time was the same thing just a different bartender .
we then _num_ min later decided to ask if we could order .
and do n't let them watch movies while customers are waiting for drinks .
so i grabbed my shit and left .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
no other patrons were on the patio ( figures ! )
this past saturday , however , was horrible .
when he came out the woman followed and completely ignored us .
`` i am too busy to be bothered with your little problems .
this is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business .
i ca n't give this bar high marks .
but the service sucks .
to get any kind of service , you need to sit at the bar .
if you sit at a table , you will be ignored .
the waitress never starts before about _num_ pm .
it sucks for the patron .
i guess it just make their life easier for scheduling .
it was so bad that we decided to leave and never come back .
i went there on halloween night .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
the bartender was extremely rude and spoke to me like a was an idiot .
not going back there .
_num_ stars if yelp would let me .
did n't even know _num_ drinks we asked for so i ordered a beer .
i saw plenty of reviews about cheap drinks .
nothing that special about this place .
not even _num_ star is deserved !
i personally hate this place !
old , dirty , smelly bar with poor poor customer service !
can not believe rudeness of some but not all staff .
standing directly in front of him without a drink is not enough ?
worst experience ever !
bartender was super rude !
no customer service at all .
and no managers to speak to .
had the worst time !
the bartenders have no sense of priority and they treat you like crap .
i 've never cried from a night out except for when i went here .
thumbs down .
the place was full but the whole experience left much to be desired .
it stinks .
& i did n't get any service for _num_ minutes so i walked out .
i could n't find one thing that sets happy hour for what nothing .
definitely the worst bar i 've ever been to .
but , why was it so dead on a friday night ?
the bathrooms were kind of gross .
when we arrived here i was charged $ _num_ for a shot .
i asked the waitress why i paid more .
i find that ridiculous !
you should charge the same price throughout the bar .
we walked in at around 11pm on a wednesday .
i asked her what they had on draft and she replied i have _num_ .
i do n't like it '' .
she said she did n't like them at all and gave no suggestion .
our server was not friendly in the least and even blatantly avoided our table .
and they were the absolute worst nachos i 've ever had .
really , is that allowed ?
some of the worst service i 've ever received .
he was extremely unpleasant to deal with .
i would skip this one .
you know , the ones over $ _num_ .
and , i was the only one in the store during the whole episode .
it looks old and outdated .
this is n't a super walmart .
it 's dirty and filthy .
i do n't understand why people still go here .
total disaster .
and would n't you know it !
this bugs me more than anything else , even the damage to the vehicles .
also , many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening .
bad experience for entire process .
not a _num_ hour store !
zero customer service .
this wal-mart have no shopping baskets .
soo i need to use a shopping cart for my three items .
1st , hello rude girl .
okay , fail one walmart customer service .
worst customer service ever for a corporate company .
horrible service , no one around to ever help you find stuff .
unless you know exactly where something is do n't waste your time here .
i checked my phone and gave him the order number , still nothing .
talked with someone from electronics the first minute .
so nobody can answer questions over the phone ?
it 's ridiculous they are booked out _num_ hours !
that 's not the problem .
so frustrating .
tried to buy a straight talk iphone _num_ twice from here .
oh well , they just lost a $ _num_ sale !
the manager gave me the bullshit that they are service dogs .
drove _num_ miles round trip .
no big deal .
thought nothing of it .
i said , no thank you .
he did n't move .
he just stood there and stared .
i am never coming back .
they also could not give me a _num_ ' truck .
there is no excuse that the truck was not there .
horrible experience !
bad customer service and trucks that are in poor working condition .
plus it was expensive as shit !
just by a washer and dryer instead or go someplace else .
avoid .
the manager quoted me $ _num_ .
really , really ?
so all this time you could 've had my dress done in _num_ hrs ?
yeah , awful .
no complaints .
no , no , no just do n't go here .
total disappointment .
until the past _num_ weeks there were no problems .
last week we dropped off _num_ shirts and _num_ pants .
in addition they had lost three shirts .
i went about _num_ days later to see if they found the missing shirt .
i will never go to this walgreens again .
horrible !
why we did nothing wrong .
this has got to be the worst pharmacy of all the walgreens stores !
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
they also had no reason on why they did n't contact me .
so disappointing .
worst walgreens i 've ever been to ( speaking for the pharmacy ) .
they only had one technician working and took forever getting everyone 's prescriptions .
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
this pharmacy seems to be quite inefficient .
the pharmacy lost my moms time sensitive prescription after it had been processed .
they did n't even have the right product from the beginning .
which they should have stated the first time she went to pick it up .
i wish there were zero stars !
i have never been to a worse pharmacy !
there was no explanation as to why ... .
this is over _num_ hours !
i went to them to correct the bill , which they realized the mistake .
they told me to wait to get a new statement to pay .
i would recommend not just paying them but go over your statement .
i would also never recommend you renting from them .
highly greedy .
laundry room is horrible .
do n't recommend to live with this company 's property at any level .
i am an angry customer who do n't felt being treated correctly .
worst customer service ever !
i tried to tell him i need the number today due to other travel .
not to mention that i was n't even sure they could accommodate my request .
he just lost a big chunk of change .
me : i know , except that this ride is for tomorrow morning .
i gave him my name , and that was that -- it was cancelled .
i declined and drove myself to the airport .
very disappointed .
however , the selection is nice , but we wo n't be back .
on july _num_ , _num_ , i received poor customer service .
he would not be in until after _num_ pm , i was told .
no wonder the employees are rude .
course is in terrible conditions .
the poor conditions keep serious players away .
terrible management .
terrible management .
went with son and a few of his friends .
i was ready to just leave at this point ...
unfortunately i hate to write a negative review but i have too .
he made me feel terrible .
which makes me sad .
left a message that i wanted to place an order .
nobody returned the call .
not enough to even taste .
we would n't go back to this place .
i will not go back .
this place is definitely not closed .
the pool looks like a dirty mexican jacuzzi and smells like one too .
this place was the worst place to ever live !
the office always gave me the run around very rude .
also the gym is huge but none of the equipment works !
living here was so gross !
i hated living here !
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
maintenance has no clue what they are doing .
way to not know what your doing .
this ends today sadly .
their customer service is awful as well they do n't help .
all the yrs i have been renting and i 've never had this happen .
i just wished i would have believed the reviews .
i put the wrong zip code .
should be _num_ .
do n't let the word scottsdale fool you this place is a complete ghetto .
do n't let the name and location fool you stay out !
this is by far the worst apartment community i have ever lived in .
just do n't live here .
do n't waste your time .
just out in the open , no big deal .
are you kidding me ?
also , they lied about 24/7 security .
there is no security whatsoever .
we placed _num_ work orders within the first _num_ weeks of us being there .
they were very loud and made noise throughout the night .
after countless efforts of talking to her she did not really fix the issue .
finally this issue was resolved but it was not an easy process .
i never felt safe walking to my car .
well we were wrong .
three times i gave this place a chance .
i am a guy who is in a hurry to find a place !
get the ghetto basketball court out .
until then , too expensive for what is lacking .
who does this , no other apartment complex 's do .
our experience at scottsdale springs has been dreadful .
the grass is dead everywhere .
the view from my front door is literally a pile of garbage .
this sounds like an exaggeration - it is n't .
mark taylor did n't even respond .
so what if it 's ugly for a few months ? ''
it 's august and the renovations have n't even started .
i do n't get it .
this place is so ugly and disgusting !
this apartment complex has the absolute worst parking situation ever .
it is a compete and total disregard to the tenants here .
for starters , the smell .
nothing helped .
they barely have enough spaces for the people who live there .
the walls are that thin .
no amount of cleaning you do will be good enough to not be charged .
just not when it actually matters for their residents .
this place is crap !
still after a year no grass only green grass by the office .
no grass , crappy environment .
no explanation .
mark taylor properties , step up your game .
you purchased an absolute crap hole .
_num_ ) my moving out bill .
this means that over _num_ % of the carpet was covered by furniture .
i was n't expecting much from scottsdale springs .
scottsdale springs is charging me around $ _num_ .
thing is there is nothing you can do against these guys .
mark taylor does n't care if your happy here .
once you leave , someone else will fall into the trap .
jesus ; this place has zero concept of time .
you would think he would know how to do a pick up correctly .
no , no .
i would never step foot in this store again .
she absolutely did not go out of her way to help the customer .
it took almost _num_ hours to do my hair .
it also was supposed to include a cut .
the cut was uneven and terrible .
she said she changed it to noon per my request .
she also was short and rude with me .
do n't waste your time with this stylist .
so i was extremely dissappointed .
i was so mad at her and myself .
i would suggest dont go to her .
not as advertised .
very disappointed .
poor customer service in store .
she said that i was not allowed to see the other dr .
i said , ok , let me talk to her .
she then transferred the call to the assistant 's voicemail .
this was terrible customer service and could have very easily been a non issue .
i should be allowed to see whatever dr .
so we did n't get menus for the first _num_ minutes we were there .
and the courses themselves were pretty nice .
the other main problem is that most of the people here are older .
not good for a bachelor party of guys in their _num_ 's .
so i would n't recommend this place .
for a high rated resort , it fell way short of expectations .
all in all , the service experience was extremely poor .
as a phoenix resident , i was personally embarrassed by the service .
so essentially , you do n't really have a view .
so that wasted over an hour of my time for nothing .
lets just say i wish i went to the many other resorts in scottsdale .
first thing , there was no wi-fi in my room .
but nothing happened .
you 'd probably get a better deal .
wow , this place is made for huge groups , not intimate at all !
the phoenician is a dated property and in need of a facelift .
spend your money elsewhere !
i called security and they came to take my report and search the room .
not surprisingly , the next morning they said the employees denied taking the money .
she then offered to send me $ _num_ to compensate me for my loss .
oh yeah , the hotel is old , tired and run down .
they could n't pay me enough to go back .
stayed there this pass memorial day weekend and was the worst time ever .
when we arrived they said that my room was not ready .
lol i do n't think so .
from my last experience i will never go or recommend the phoenician again .
the worst resort i have ever stayed out .
no service , no consideration for guest .
just awful .
this place just stinks to hell and back .
terrible , just crappy in every way .
sleep on the street , you 'll do better .
i wish i could give it minus _num_ stars .
i would n't stay here again if they paid me .
i ca n't believe how this place has changed for the worse .
they were dressed nice , and we had been out to the pool .
_num_ diamonds ?
disappointing service all around .
this review is strictly for relish burger bistro located at resort by golf club .
why do it matter if the place was pretty empty ?
food was mediocre .
mostly the happy hour menu is limited .
alcoholic drinks were good but pricey at $ _num_ - $ _num_ each .
waitress seemed annoyed , disinterested , and fake .
not a place i would return to ... .
anything they say , ask in writing .
it 's terrible .
there are _num_ floors and i 'm on the 5th floor .
cockroaches in my room .
terrible service is restaurants .
service was just as disappointing .
the wi-fi connection never worked the five days i was there .
i would never stay their again .
we called room service for towels and it took _num_ minutes to bring them .
the service at dinner last night was awful .
i would not return and at these prices , they should be ashamed .
the not so great : the staff is not `` ritz '' ready .
need extra towels or pillows from housekeeping expect to wait an hour .
the spa is extremely dated and the staff is average .
this was a terrible experience .
this did not feel like a _num_ star hotel at all .
i 'm originally from scottsdale , and grew up dreaming of getting married here .
what a horrific experience , from start to almost finish .
from the start , nothing i was told was what actually happened .
no place comfortable to sit , no bathroom , no tv .
the phoenician really dropped the ball and disappointed .
if i could give it a negative star i would in a heartbeat !
regardless , i drove down to the place and checked in .
i was pretty pissed , so i decided to cancel the mariachi idea .
room _num_ .
this place was n't accommodating at all .
absolute nightmare .
feel free to read my review on that horrible dinner experience as well .
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
first off , they no longer include mimosas .
we waited _num_ minutes for a bottle of champagne !
i had booked the room online months before for several hundred dollars .
but no .
they said that the manager was busy , and that security would be coming .
that is not how you treat your paying , repeat customers .
such a disappointment .
well that was the first bad sign of staying in an outdated hotel .
just a way to suck every last cent out of your customers .
really bad !
i also do n't blame smokers for smoking in places where it is allowed .
horrible service .
horrible room .
horrible everything .
basically was ignored the whole time we stayed .
the worst !
a week later i was charged _num_ from the spa .
and the hotel is so outdated and old .
i could not have been more wrong .
talk about garbage pizza .
the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated , frozen pizza .
dreadful food ( have not tried their pizza ) .
this is warmed over food at its worst .
walked around the store for _num_ minutes with no acknowledgement from the staff .
there was no other customer in the store .
this place , at least today , did n't offer that .
for the price that i paid , i guess that 's to be expected .
i ordered the danny 's special , so there were both wings and fries .
this place is absolutely horrible .
they told me _num_ minutes until it was ready .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star !
i would n't recommend going to this location .
first time i ate there will be my last .
the wings were mediocre tasting and were very small in size .
i also ordered an overpriced burger that was sub-par to mcdonalds .
i 'll just stick with zipps for wings and burgers .
i first step in the store it reeks of monkey balls lol .
first shop i checked out after moving to the phoenix area .
small selection of toys and other accessories .
this business has worst return policies !
i have never been more stressed out shopping for makeup in my life .
i walked in today ready to spend money and the service was unbelievably unhelpful .
low expectations from the start but this was bad .
honey mustard was surprisingly bland .
and soggy tomato .
not worth the money .
the lobby , gym and surrounding areas were just great .
not cool , marriott , not cool .
i have to stay another night tonight so we 'll see how it goes .
we will not stay here again .
noisy .
do n't stay in room _num_ .
i called at your service rep _num_ times in _num_ hours .
this was a mistake .
that was n't too cool .
speaking of the shower , no hot water !
well , _num_ minutes later and it was still lukewarm .
this room really felt like a super _num_ suite .
the shoppe had nothing .
this one was limited .
had everything you needed to stay active while you 're away .
the restaurant seating is ok.
the mashed potatoes were excellent and the asparagus was n't too bad either .
the wine was extremely over priced .
we paid $ _num_ a glass for a _num_ alexander valley cab .
the service was horrible .
when we were finally helped i felt like i was wasting her time .
avoid .
i had planned a _num_ night stay here but checked out after one .
my traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do .
but would be about _num_ minutes and it would be up and running .
me : i 'd like to get this skirt hemmed .
her : twenty eight dollars ( $ _num_ ) .
no hello , no smile , no `` can i help you . ''
me : what is expensive ?
me : ( thinking how does she stay in business ? )
not a friendly place at all .
worst business lady ever !
this place is terrible .
it smells like rotten food and looks old and dirty .
the woman who runs the shop is rude .
i walked into the store , nobody greeted me at all .
everybody looked , but nobody said anything to me .
the staff is helpful and friendly .
the owner , `` hong '' , however - is not .
if one purchases here , i would definitely ask for proof of authenticity .
there 's another issue : pricing .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
i had a horrible experience .
such a bad experience today !
i 'm never going back .
the receptionists were useless .
this place is disappointing and everybody who works there is useless .
do n't waste your time and _num_ times what you should be paying !
arriving ten minutes before my scheduled appointment .
your health matters and should be thoroughly explained .
also , my fillings ended up uneven .
then through each room she introduced me to people .
which makes me feel uncomfortable .
then she brings me back a quote for $ _num_ .
i said no multiple times and she kept making me feel uncomfortable .
sounds to me like she just wants my money .
i left the office feeling pissed .
i guess they thought i was stupid or something .
get things back into proper working order , and i 'll think about staying .
rent at your own risk .
went here on a groupon type deal .
my nail tech was _num_ minutes late .
waste of time and money .
there rude and unprofessional .
and no one gave me a number to make an appointment or anything .
we left after pointing out this was not showing customer appreciation .
left _num_ days before next billing period .
no refund .
warning , do your homework before stepping inside .
i 'll never go back ... .
wow , was i disappointed .
we got there _num_ minutes early to get a good table .
first _num_ acts was like high school entertainment .
the pics you see here are nothing like the place .
one room packed so tight you could not move .
too much nice entertainment around for your dollars than this place .
totally disappointed .
leave a message .
ca n't believe they stay in business .
my cash will be spent in other parts of phoenix from now on .
chicken wings were microwaved with slimy skin and rubbery meat .
hummus was tasteless .
pita chips were burnt .
could you imagine if they could n't pull that off ?
so my wife and i had tickets to the 10pm show this past saturday .
i tried calling a few time most times no answer .
so only way i got through was email .
they did n't say we are sorry for your issue or anything .
wo n't be back .
not so impressed .
just not good business sense folks .
i wo n't patron it again .
again and as told they were trying to locate it .
my coat was bagged and i paid the $ _num_ .
and could n't make the _num_ mile round trip to go back .
i am pulling my fur from them and will never use them again .
well first off , it was hot .
maybe if they had more fans things like this would n't happen .
it was , in one word , a disaster .
it was -- quite literally -- between _num_ and _num_ degrees inside the hall .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
an incredibly disappointment .
no a/c .
no a/c .
no a/c .
i did at least get my money back .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
the whole experience was awful .
mediocre at best for concerts .
the acoustics also do n't seem very good there .
big time disaster .
major fail !
the winter beer festival was just ok .
they were too perfect .
i drank some habanero ipa and burned my throat .
i waited _num_ minutes to go see a show i already had tickets to .
tons of empty space .
and no refunds for the tickets they bought !
$ _num_ for a mixed drink in a plastic cup .
food was lame .
instead they charged me $ _num_ for a small soda .
ugh , it made me so mad .
would n't come here for oktoberfest again .
the food was mediocre , and not terribly hot .
not impressed at all .
i was actually ignored at the counter when i needed help .
the rude sales girl turned her back and walked away .
too bad for you ... i had lots of money to spend today .
complete waste of time .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
he could n't do any of it .
no thanks !
treatments i received were met with marginal benefit .
the dr is knowledgeable and professional , but unfortunately the assistants ruin the office .
unfortunately , i was sorely disappointed by both the food and service .
i started with the grilled pear salad with gorgonzola and mixed greens .
my two bites were really gritty and they were not perfectly cooked .
no melt in your mouth quality .
it was definitely not worth what we paid at all .
and trust me , you should stand outside , far far away .
first time , not so good .
second time , not so good .
every time since , not so good .
if we 're lucky , the only problem is our order is screwed up .
most likely it 's screwed up and bad food .
so i walk away with two lessons learned .
but do n't try this at home ... i am a trained professional !
i then went down the street to church 's chicken to complete my order .
she alone is reason enough for me not to return to this location .
for fast food i like kfc in general ( grilled chicken ) .
she was just letting this poor girl handle all the orders and food herself .
not professional at all , please fire her .
what the other _num_ people were doing , i have no clue .
but they sure werent helping the lady out .
try to avoid .
worst experience ever !
_num_ minutes later i go inside and ask for a refund .
worst kfc i have ever been to .
scottsdale ( indian school ) kfc is horrible .
do n't bother going .
corporate , are you listening ?
this location is run worse than the va .
heads must roll ; it 's the only way to get right with us .
worst kfc service ever .
went in on a sunday with a sunday only coupon .
the gal at the counter did n't know what to do with it .
i said forget the biscuits , so she gave me cole slaw instead .
goodbye kfc , hello church 's .
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
there was only one cook .
the service itself was n't bad .
do n't nickel and dime your paying customer .
the ice machine was out of ice .
based on previous reviews , this is not unusual for this location .
the only thing edible in my order were the biscuits .
remind me why are they open again ?
the person taking the order was rude and unprofessional .
after removing the bones there was _num_ bites of chicken .
dam what a waste of $ _num_ !
do n't waste your money here .
now , this was not for two pieces and a drink and a side .
the wait was also very long .
i did not receive all that i ordered .
i will not be returning to that location .
someone called me back from corporate !
pure ripoff .
employees are rude and very slow .
went for the great arizona picnic on saturday and was not that impressed .
i 'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened yesterday .
there was n't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food .
the vendors at these booths all paid to be here .
whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it .
if i had to do this totally sober , i would 've been miserable .
that only saved one b.s .
$ _num_ to get in .
then a separate ( additional ) $ _num_ to get into the beer garden .
not so much in scottsdale .
a miniature bread bowl filled with mayonnaise .
not so much .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
weak .
overpriced and forced to wait for everything .
i counted over _num_ people in line waiting for pizza ... pizza !
the first time i came was _num_ years ago and it 's completely changed .
that would have been much more convenient for me .
_num_ words - money pit !
the foods here are pretty bland .
every other stalls sell plain tacos .
the non tacos vendors are drinks and chain restaurants .
the only good thing about this place is the people watching .
its not worth what you pay .
i waited _num_ minutes for pizza !
i spent $ _num_ on 1/4 a box !
next year , i am not wasting my time on the picnic .
we kept adding money to our cards .
they escorted us out ... i was respectful .
been there , done that ; once here was enough .
for those two things alone , i give _num_ stars .
it was not bad i guess , maybe i had too high of expectations .
i never could find them and i really wanted to check those out .
the event needs some work before i will go back .
ugh .
even veterans of this were a bit confused .
the food , for the most part disgusting and expensive .
the bathroom situation was insane , especially for the women .
not so much for me .
i really miss this festival !
i had friends from back east plan their trips to scottsdale around this festival .
and set your expectations low .
pretty bummed about the scottsdale culinary festival .
the choices of food options has definitely gone down .
i looked at the spinatos pizza place and it looked worse than frozen pizza .
the technician who came out was rude , rude , rude .
came here on a supposed business hour , but it was closed .
plus he was n't feeling well .
i would not recommend anyone taking their pets here .
my dog was not given the care he needed .
greedy !
not a good place to take your animals unless its an emergency .
the staff is ok , not extremely nice but not mean .
only a couple of people actually seem to know what they 're doing .
just all around a shoddy place .
do not believe the positive reviews -- they are paid advertising .
decent prices for boarding , ridiculous prices for all else .
you will find equal or better for less ) .
i took my _num_ month old puppy here .
so anyway , i took my little puppy there .
i know when i am being scammed , so i declined .
this is one of the most disappointing 24/7 vets i have ever gone too .
i went in and gave all my animals symptoms .
i get to pick which test to do , no consultation !
i have owned over _num_ dogs and over _num_ cats in my lifetime .
i would not recommend this vet to anyone .
scottsdale vet clinic is rude and greedy , and inexperienced .
fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me !
do not take your pet here in the middle of the night .
you 'll be met with a rude vet tech and a condescending doctor .
she was cold .
i guess she does n't like when she 's asked too many questions .
needless to say never visiting this office again .
an _num_ hour grooming appointment is ridiculous and unacceptable .
when i took them home they did n't seem right at all .
she made zero conversation .
and i live _num_ miles away !
i 'm sorry to my red bone .
i took my dog here to have him put to sleep do to .
that would not stop he had over _num_ in one day and .
i was sad i was hurt .
i bought airline tickets to spread him over disneyland .
it sucks but there was nothing i could do .
needless to say , we are livid and stunned over this error .
do not go here if your pet has any issue - especially after hours .
pets are expensive , i understand but no reason to waste time or money .
no one came in to communicate anything to me .
this kind of veterinary care is unacceptable and careless by my standards .
i 'm not saying this veterinarian office is n't good .
they fell to measure up to my puppy needs once he became ill .
the overall front service has been very sloppy in the past six months .
in other words , he educated me .
it is a shame that i 'm leaving after nine years of loyal support .
this was a disappointment and true waste of my time .
you lost a client today scottsdale vet clinic .
i 'm sorry to hear about the groomers emergency situation , rachel .
would n't even look at my cat , wanted me to sign paperwork .
poor thing , i 'm so glad i took her home though .
i am really embarrassed to send my patients to this pharmacy .
my patient 's needs will be met by someone else .
pain in my ass a little but whatever .
the 2nd rx pissed me off .
nice wasted lunch break !
they made nothing about this easy .
i would absolutely never , ever recommend them .
i 'm so glad i will never deal with them again .
i wish i could give them negative stars .
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
i am a plumber , asshole .
so i have to go to the famous scottsdale plumbing co .
s e v e n t y dollars .
i bought it at ace for about $ _num_ .
so anyway , buy nothing but the very minimum of what you need there .
i just wish they were a little less expensive .
they looked at the job and quoted $ _num_ .
at this time i got confused based on the initial quote they gave me .
the decision was made for them to return the following week on tuesday .
no one arrived on tuesday .
i called the office and they said robert had me scheduled for friday .
this messed up my schedule and needed them to complete the job before friday .
between this time and monday i was out of town for business matters .
horrible customer service .
company fails to listen to the voice of the customer .
i would avoid at all times , you will be disappointed .
this place has a chaotic feel .
all in all , i am not coming back to this place .
where is my usual laundromat , you may ask ?
no ac !
the change machine was out of quarters .
we walked in and 1/2 the machines were out of order .
someone in there with a couple of dogs .
would n't wash my dog there much less anything else .
the owner was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful .
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
she said , `` no , this is my space . ''
i 'll avoid going here again .
that being said , it was only 1pm and it was lunch time .
a burger is an ok order , but stay away from the reuben .
big gripe : no fries ?
they serve potato chips with all their sandwiches , no fries .
but a true old time parlor should have french fries .
ok , end of gripe .
it 's so expensive for an unappetizing sundae .
$ _num_ for a lunch size chef salad ?
oh , the sandwich does come with stale potato chips , too .
second of all , the service was lousy .
to our surprise , she said `` no .
now , it seems to be going downhill ... fast .
i am sure you are wondering where i am going with this .
it just does n't manage to be charming and here is why .
first and foremost ; the service sucked .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
sugar bowl could do it .
disappointing and not very good .
that 's not good .
tonight however , was the final straw .
i 'm tired of being ripped off by these people .
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
nothing special .
awkward line set up if you just want an ice cream cone .
history or no history , the sugar bowl has lost this customer for good .
the carmel and chocolate sundaes were ok but nothing spectacular .
the brownie was not warmed up and was hard .
i like the nostalgia of the place but i will not be back .
this place really should get _num_ stars but it does n't even deserve _num_ .
no excuse for this .
secondly , the bathrooms are always disgusting .
apparently , i went to the wrong place .
no it 's not !
first off , i was under the impression they had homemade ice cream .
i blew through _num_ calories + for garbage .
i was very dissapointed .
so let me get on to the dish i had .
i ate half of `` the top hat '' .
sounds good does n't it ?
not good .
egg salad , blt , burgers , tuna , grilled cheese etc ... .
the problem is nothing was good .
the burger was tasteless and very , very small .
id say about the size patty you would find on a mcdonalds kids cheeseburger .
no fries .
no fries ?
coleslaw was the worst i have ever had !
this place just sucks .
_num_ damn trips to just get our drinks .
they charge for refills too !
way too pink .
it just was n't happening .
not even close .
dh order the turkey sandwich .
it was turkey and bread and lettuce and mayo .
no tomato .
not worth the $ _num_ price tag for sure .
if a sundae could be bland , this was .
nothing special .
it 's more of a to-go dessert place if you are craving a sundae !
i wanted to like this place , i really did .
quickly did not come .
daddy and daughter returned before the server showed up .
i was not very impressed .
the food was alright and definitely not worth the price .
it 's not even worth the nostalgia .
come on , sugar bowl , step it up a little .
i took my niece here for a pretty bad experience .
the play was dingy and the service was slow with overpriced sugary goodies .
will not waste time here again .
there are only a few flavors of ice cream .
with no apologies .
c ) the wait staff was barely courteous .
so much so that i could too easily hear their conversations .
older gentleman wandering around had a stained shirt on .
i ordered a root beer float & it was a disaster .
i know it 's old school scottsdale but it needs an overhaul .
he said no , they are for `` _num_ '' or more .
not thing special .
terrible service , rude staff & average ice cream .
the food ( burgers ) was gross !
very gross .
very gross !
the staff looked a little tired and very bored .
we did n't wait around to try and get ice cream .
we were n't feeling good after lunch !
i was very disappointed .
get your sweets fix elsewhere .
something i thought would be so simple , guess not for this sugar bowl .
ca n't u see there 's no drinks on our table ?
then , the food comes out and every dish is made incorrectly .
and the problems , they did n't go away instead , got much worse .
gross !
been going to the sugar bowl for _num_ years .
there were _num_ other customers in the entire restaurant at the time .
_num_ minutes go by without any service .
she claims , `` i do n't know what it is . ''
so now after _num_ minutes i also ask for water , napkins and silverware .
the food did not take long at all to arrive .
the lettuce was fresh and cold and so we 're the tomatoes .
the tuna salad was mediocre .
the situation of the restroom : the sugar bowl was established in _num_ .
i think the wallpaper goes back to that period and is downright dirty .
old , dirty and it looks smelly .
there are many more options in that area to spend my time and money .
good ice-cream poor service .
_num_ bucks a cone .
service was not good .
we had burger and roast beef sandwiches .
the burger was average and the roast beef was simply terrible .
desperate need of some tlc .
my mom had an egg salad sandwich and it was completely bland .
i will not be back .
... and i spent a couple of hours in our hotel bathroom that night !
when we received our sundaes they were sans whipped cream .
poor form .
san francisco newspaper recommended sugar bowl .
worst ice cream i 've had in a long time .
this place is just awful now .
too bad .
shame .
the few bites of solid ice cream were freezer burned .
my sundae was fine , but nothing i could n't have made at home .
i had the hot dog and my wife had a grilled cheese .
nothing special especially for $ _num_ .
not really .
wish it was what i remembered from when i was younger .
that girl looked at us and said , `` so _num_ . ''
so as if i was n't already annoyed , now i am really frustrated !
the girl walks over , drops off our waters and walks away .
but i ca n't !
$ _num_ for a one scoop sundae ?
me : excuse me , this should have whipped cream and a cherry .
them : sorry , our whipped cream machine is broken .
me ( thought ) : _num_ .
$ _num_ ?
are we in los angeles at these prices ?
never did try the ice cream or food because we left .
definately will not be going back .
we walked in about _num_ minutes before closing .
the chicken sandwich was so dry it was hard to chew .
my experience was very mixed .
the ice cream is creamy but the prices are ridiculous .
there is no children 's menu so we ordered my daughter _num_ hot dogs .
i got the bill and they charged me $ _num_ for _num_ hot dogs .
are you kidding me ?
wo n't be going back !
terrible service .
mediocre food .
we literally spent _num_ hours here just trying to have lunch .
by the time we were done , most of the nearby shops had closed .
we were sooooo disappointed .
it is not the same .
she said she asked another wait staff to bring it over .
perhaps more customer service training is needed .
there is a really bad smell as soon as you walk inside the door .
the restrooms and general areas are not clean .
it 's such a shame .
the decor , if clean would be on spot .
it was n't really bad , but it was n't great , either .
terrible service .
just terrible .
no organized line to order at the counter and the hostess was rude .
wasted _num_ min .
never going back .
ice cream is not worth that hassle .
there were places that looked like they had n't ever been cleaned .
the pie tasted just like costco apple pie .
i ordered the egg salad on sourdough .
the kettle chips were the only decent thing on the plate .
the service was also not good .
no silverware or napkins were brought out .
server with buzz haircut as rude .
not the nostalgic fun place they pretend to be .
wo n't be back for a long time unfortunately .
i would have understood if it had been busy but it was n't !
our waitress was pleasant but she was the only good thing about the place .
i visited sugar bowl with my parents recently .
the cart smells bad , as you can imagine .
i should have believed the negative reviews .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
the sandwiches were absolutely awful .
$ _num_ for a veggie sandwich on `` toasted '' bread that was cold .
over inflated prices for food that is beyond sub par .
did not try the food and probably will not .
very mediocre place .
mediocre desserts and building was old and kind of creepy .
it was like my _num_ year old son made it .
certainly not grilled ; watery .
the decor is definitely vintage gone bad !
the service was good but the food was mediocre .
i got chocolate ice cream and fudge over a brownie .
i would recommend spending your money someone else .
the coffee was one of the worst cups of coffee i 've ever had .
the arcade room smells horrible , the carpet is disgusting .
too bad his front office person ruined it .
ten stars for him , minus nine for his office person .
at this point , you could n't pay me to go back there .
horrible dentist !
they wanted to get me in immediately .
so , no !
this dental office only caused headaches for my boyfriend and i .
dr. wilson still refused to pay him !
dr. wilson is just unethical .
i will not do business with them again .
i walked out of that place and convinced others to go with me .
this places deserves negative stars !
unbelievable .
are n't these people the dentists ?
do not go here , absolutely horrible .
i have had no problems with the friendliness of the staff .
it seem that everytime i go in i have to have some major procedure .
um , no thanks .
the dentists are fine but the way the office is run is horrible .
if your time is n't precious , then i would recommend them .
if , like me , your time is precious , stay clear !
this place is awful !
then she gave me the cost with their `` discount '' plan .
how rude to think my time is n't valuable as well !
are you kidding me ?
i will not be going back to this dentist , ever !
worst experience !
what a total ripoff !
big mistake .
terrible experience .
however , my experience at this particular store was not good .
the whole experience was less than savory .
unfortunately , management needs an attitude adjustment .
we wo n't be back to this lv again .
i will never purchase another lv bag again .
the second time i had an issue was _num_ weeks ago .
not a big deal , i understood this would happen .
how in the world did they happen to make the same mistake twice ?
no , lady .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
never buy lv !
too bad cause sales staff was great though .
horrible horrible service do n't shop there .
will not buy lv again !
once entering the store , absolutely no one greeted me .
it was a sunday afternoon , and it was not very busy at all .
finally someone grabbed me my purse i wanted .
bad bad customer service .
the oriental girl that works here is super rude .
rip off .
when i went to the store i got a cold reception .
horrible customer service !
i can not do anything for you . ''
she could not and would not explain herself .
very disappointed with the customer service .
went there twice , and wo n't go back .
although i think the false advertising is crap .
not _num_ % , not _num_ % but _num_ % !
i want to refill my bottle !
all it is is a way for the studio to make more money .
after visiting bikram yoga tempe , this studio is not too great .
when you walk in , it smells like feet .
it makes me wonder how often the studio is cleaned down .
for me , bikram is the only thing that has helped with the pain .
i do n't have a choice .
what are they gon na do , call the cops on me ?
this place is the worst , most unprofessional business i have ever come across .
the teachers are awful also .
the enchiladas came smothered in cheese ( good ! )
avoid it at all costs !
the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
i was so disappointed .
i absolutely did not like this place .
still a shrimp novice , i had no clue .
`` you grab their little legs and pull . ''
this place is fucking awful .
it 's the most disgusting thing i 've ever seen referred to as food .
the chicken was dry and clearly had been sitting on heat for several hours .
the chips are the freshest thing sold here and are n't bad .
the salsa is n't so bad either .
i have never been this sick from eating anywhere .
my bf and i split the cheese crisp with beef ( first mistake ) .
the beef looked grey and the cheese looked old and overcooked .
also , i kept seeing so many servers standing around shooting the shit .
honestly , taco bell is a better choice .
i do n't understand why this place has good reviews .
i usually trust yelp but this place was horrible .
i had a tamale and chili relleno combo with rice and beans .
there was no texture to the food and everything had the same taste .
i will not be going back to los olivos .
a two taco meal with rice and beans for $ _num_ ?
the queso ( $ _num_ .
the rice and beans were find , but nothing great .
i thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever , but no .
it was kind of awkward , actually .
kind of disappointed in you , los olivos .
really big waste of a night .
service was nowhere near ok .
even once we were seated the food was just mediocre at best .
chimichanga wasnt that bad .
the ambience was ok ; the food bad .
what a disappointment it was !
we were also served chips and salsa which were ok , nothing special .
they came out and again what a disappointment !
hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside .
tired mexican place in scottsdale , with very mediocre food .
we had a cheese crisp with chicken and a mexican salad .
both were bland and you could easily make better mexican food at home !
it 's sad .
i was embarrassed after having taken out of town visitors to this place .
we did n't like any of these dishes we tried .
: ( too greasy and no good taste !
nothing at all memorable about this place .
the refried beans were bland and the rice overcooked and mushy .
the worst mexican my girlfriend and i have ever had !
just thrown together .
could n't find our enchilada in the mess of beans , rice and whatever .
greasy hard shell tacos , they sucked .
do n't even bother wasting your time and money .
the plates are gross looking .
was n't worth _num_ that 's for sure .
what we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment .
all _num_ members of my party thought their meals were sub-par .
however , the bartenders were outstanding !
the bad : the cheese ... .
meaning bad queso and bad cheese enchiladas .
i really love cheese and they miss the mark .
this is a low rent dive type mexican place .
after that , it was all downhill .
the plates look like a disaster when served ; sauce everywhere , very disorganized .
the refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans ; avoid .
not authentic .
the food is just plain bad .
looks like i 'm never coming back .
it did n't even fill me up .
there was n't any flavors to savor or remember .
nothing special .
a poor example of mexican food in phoenix .
we ordered a pitcher of margaritas and were disappointed there as well .
this place is just a tourist trap in old town scottsdale .
everything else is pretty mediocre and flavorless .
what more can i say except it is over priced , greasy mexican food !
service was a little slow but cordial .
the only saving grace of the awful restaurant was the guacamole .
this place lacks so much .
it need a complete head to toe makeover from decor to .
that 's it for me , i wo n't be back .
btw , do n't go in the bathrooms , they were really dirty .
asked twice for drink refills and never did get them .
had to flag a busboy down with a water pitcher just to get that .
food was blah and pretty tasteless .
overall the whole place looked very worn and dirty .
and this was not the first time i 've been to los olivos .
when i corrected him he ignored me .
the salsa was all tomato water and no substance .
the food was awful .
the beans were crusty and had no flavor .
he asked for no tomatoes and it was covered in tomatoes .
we were all unsatisfied .
_num_ bucks for a taco plate , no thanks !
this place just lost my long term business .
the beef in my burrito tasted like ocean water ... plus .
however , i think the food is pretty bland .
i also think it 's a bit overpriced .
the food was mediocre at best .
now i have to find a new mexican sit down restaurant .
chips were cold and hard not warm and crispy .
all of the items were quite bland .
with the addition of the hot salsa my dish was mediocre .
also , the food is overpriced .
the patio is awful !
the food is basic canned beans and standard rice and overpriced .
the service was terrible .
either way , you 're better off at chipotle .
the food i ordered ( chicken fajita ) was nothing short of disgusting .
the staff is so rude !
called them and the manager said he was too busy to speak with me .
could not believe his response .
unbelievable .
my son had the fish tacos and the fish was delicious .
the rice was mushy , however the beans were okay .
i had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry .
the enchilada sauce was bland and my rice was also mushy .
the service was very slow .
do n't even waste your time .
the building is old and the bathrooms are disgusting and falling apart .
the service is very bad .
the food is better than most mediocre mexican restaurants but not worth the hassle .
get it together los olivos !
fairly terrible experience .
on the bright side , the chips and salsa were pretty good .
the food took literally an hour and a half to get to our table .
i had to spit out half of it because of such low quality .
what a waste of money .
this place is disorganized , rude , and low quality .
if you go here , go luck .
it was very greasy but oddly the tortilla was hard and cardboard like .
it was gross .
my date had the flautas as which were bland to say the least .
tacos with a hair baked into the shell .
extremely disappointed .
will probably not return to los olivos ... .
i walk in and see two counters with people standing at them .
she looks up and does n't say anything .
i ask if we can be seated and she still says absolutely nothing .
at this point i 'm really confused .
i waited about _num_ or _num_ minutes and he never returned .
i walked back without the menu .
a server walked by us .
ignored us again .
after about _num_ minutes someone came out with waters .
it was very obvious why it was dead at 6pm in downtown scottsdale .
if they ever want to survive they need to do a _num_ degree turn .
i went there last night with a large party ( _num_ ) .
however everyone was pretty short and rude .
all of which should have been warning signs of what was to come .
what we received should not be called mexican food .
we had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food .
the steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy .
los olivos has obviously stopped trying .
the beef burrito was beef and a tortilla -- nothing else ; very bland .
i would give zero .
this is by far the worst mexican place ever .
i just had the worst margaritas i almost tried to drink .
it was also difficult to dip chips into salsa on a flat plate .
not like it used to be .
the food was decent , but so is taco bell .
not the experience i recall , and not a great deal either .
the sauce was so overwhelming i almost forgot i was eating an enchilada .
the others i ate with had food that was pretty mediocre .
my fajitas were a salty , oily pile of onions & peppers .
are you kidding me ?
all _num_ of us thought our entrees were terrible .
not even close .
food was hot .
the service was slow .
the overall appearance was n't very clean .
overall very disappointing for a place that use to be great .
wrong .
they 're bad !
this was really , really bad . ''
so , that 's it for los olivos .
$ _num_ , if you want strawberry . )
the fish tacos just were not very flavorful .
you get a plate for salsa , and the chips are stale .
i had the mexican pizza which was cold , greasy and average .
horrible service , felt dirty everywhere and the food was greasy and bland .
really not good food .
very disappointed when we received delivery .
_num_ burritos - food was super bland .
meat was dry and the tortillas tasted as if they were several days old .
i wo n't be back .
like you 've expected way too much only to be let down .
the booze was pretty good , but the food was pretty lackluster .
i probably wo n't be back to dine here any time soon .
horrible prices for low quality food .
their is nothing authentic about the `` mexican '' food they offer .
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
the service was very slow and the restaurant floor was very grimy .
i ordered the fish tacos and i got chicken tacos instead .
i was very disappointed with their lack of customer service and poor food .
they did n't even offer any compensation for their mess up .
was recommended this restaurant by family and was very disappointed .
food was not that good .
portions small for amount of money spent .
unbelievably terrible service , and extremely overpriced meals !
extreme tourist trap that could care less about you returning as a satisfied customer .
do n't waste your time or money in this place !
really disappointing .
my pregnant wife and i visited this restaurant on our last night in az .
taco bell is also better than this restaurant .
besides the guacamole , everything was as bland as could be .
i 'm not sure they even own spices .
so i went inside anyways and could n't believe how expensive their dishes are .
it was disappointing .
they did n't heat up my burrito all the way .
the beans inside were barely warm .
free chips and salsa nothing to brag about .
this is an embarrassment to scottsdale .
los olivos is a long time scottsdale restaurant .
the cheese crisp was divine .
she snapped back that i would be getting a credit .
hopefully you do n't also get a paper towel chimichanga !
its been over _num_ years since my hubby and i visited a bk .
then , part of our order was missing , another few minutes .
we get home , the burgers are burnt - not edible .
disgusting !
i called the manager , who spoke very little english and was completely unhelpful .
i am super pissed we wasted our money and time on crap food .
this is the worst burger king in the valley !
first of all they are sooo slow !
third , they dont seem to care !
for them to do a simple order and they still got it wrong !
needless to say , i am exploring other options for my caffeine fix ... .
despite my complaining , i continue to go back , every week ... why ?
i really need to stop going here instead of writing bad yelp reviews .
that is the only good thing about this starbucks .
yesterday they did n't put _num_ % in my coffee .
i just went this morning and i order the same thing i always get .
i was very sure to say `` add _num_ % ! ''
but no , this barista keeps having this conversation .
this starbucks is terrible .
avoid it .
but i am done .
also , it always seems like their coffee is hella burnt .
it 's totally insane that a chain coffee company can make so many mistakes .
needless to say , we are totally done with starbucks .
five cars , _num_ minutes .
my mobile order took _num_ minutes .
is n't that why you have free drink coupons ?
to say thanks for your business , sorry i messed up ?
( there were _num_ patrons sitting at the bar ) .
after several uncomfortable minutes , we were ... .
ah , uncomfortable .
knock _num_ times ?
guess i got it all wrong , obviously ) .
one star for the unbelievable wine selection .
there is something on the bottle list for everyone .
again , too bad they do n't know anything about their wine .
its changed so much and not for the good .
too bad .
nothing last forever though .
i 'm still kind of confused about how i feel about this place .
the first thing thing we noticed when we walked in was the awful smell .
poor time management by the host .
service was terrible .
she brought my husband the wrong drink .
very very rude owner and bouncer .
worst service in scottsdale .
prices are ridiculous - $ _num_ per glass of unknown cabernet .
however , we went here sunday and i was sorely disappointed .
that part is not their fault .
not worth a $ _num_ cover , folks .
slow , snobby and inattentive .
we were there at _num_ , not that late , seriously .
he avoided me for at least _num_ min after bringing me the check .
pretentious staff and clientele .
the place was so loud that it was impossible to talk .
no kidding .
once again , no kidding , folks .
pretentious .
band was terrible and too loud .
terrible terrible service given the prices .
no one asked if we were there to dine .
the only free spot had a reserved sign on it .
a cold beer is quick to come by .
ps : clientele is as pretentious as they say .
it has definitely gone downhill in that time .
they do n't even offer wine flights anymore !
on top of it , this whole mess took over an hour to get .
last time we walked in and wanted to sit at a table .
she spent most of her time chatting with the bartender .
no one called me about it to apologize .
i will never return here .
spend your money somewhere where they actually care about their customers .
however , the music was good but very loud and the service was bad .
oh dear does this jack off of a place deserve a whole star ?
ahh no !
as most people can see i rarely leave a crappy review .
now i know i hate this place .
lets go back to friday night , apparently they had a band .
so _num_ people @ $ _num_ , spent at door .
do n't bother !
shockingly rude staff !
it was very dark and crowded .
i 'm seating some guests here and you ca n't sit here ! ''
and walked away .
so i was very unimpressed with this wine bar .
then there was the wine , not so great .
this place used to be my favorite place to go .
the service has become pretty bad , and they charge cover now .
very disappointed .
methinks not .
rude staff , very dark and dim lighting and never a place to sit .
i would not recommend it .
however , the staff is rude and unorganized .
the event included a _num_ course meal which was not good .
very disappointing .
staff was horribly inattentive .
on another visit i had the humus and the skewers .
i was worn out after eating them to be quite honest .
that left a very sour taste in my mouth .
one thing that was another turn off was how loud the band was .
you could n't even talk at the table they were so loud .
the _num_ stars comes form the insanely loud live jazz music .
i still ca n't hear you , sorry .
i left without ordering anything .
manager could also care less .
the bartender got a $ _num_ tip .
the wait staff knows nothing about wine .
also , they no longer serve flights .
lame .
the cocktail came but no bottle as we waited for quite some time .
this is ridiculous !
you may want to have a chat with your staff .
not some place i 'm dying to spend my money .
the food is only average as is the wine .
a lot of hype with little delivery .
i believe their service is the worst .
not cool .
it 's a wednesday night at 9pm and there are only _num_ people here .
went here friday night for date night .
was a little disappointed based on all the great reviews .
first off , we were sweating .
not sure why they do n't turn on the ac .
very hard on the back .
hardly romantic when you sitting sweating in a dark room in an uncomfortable chair .
it was lame .
the fondue was pretty crappy .
we had way better wine snack food at other places .
each time i 've returned in _num_ has been worse though .
i thought the general standard was `` first come , first served '' .
scottsdale is supposed to be better than this .
cons : cover charge is ridiculous .
servers are not knowledgeable about wine .
this is a wine bar , no excuses .
greedy establishment trying to be like vegas with that reserved crap .
it was so rude .
it was just really tacky and unprofessional .
i spoke to the manager about our experience and he clearly did not care .
some of the worst service i 've experienced .
i will not be returning .
i looked at yelp just to find out what time the band came on .
he said we we 're not together and it would n't work for him .
basically it made the event crappy to be treated like that .
on top of this , the wine selections were awful .
at the door we were met by a rude jerk named jesse .
they took my card and did n't give it back .
never again will i go to this place .
$ _num_ for _num_ watered down drinks .
returned for a graduation party and they 're still awful .
the waitress had a dull personality and knew nothing about the menu .
the place is dead as fuck .
for that , i walked away .
confused .
but they were n't nice rooms .
_num_ minutes later i received a pool towel .
no stars for this hotel .
it 's not a resort .
also , no air conditioning during our stay .
friendly staff but the warm room made it very uncomfortable .
the owner and manager are absolutely obnoxious .
there 's only a couple employees and like one maid ?
way too much for a few staff to handle .
not a fan for many reasons .
there is no tv in the bedroom either .
later they call and cancel the reservation , no apology , nothing .
worst hotel in scottsdale , it certainly seems so .
worst apartment complex ever !
whoever they hired to do the remodel was awful .
worst apartment complex ever !
whoever they hired to do the remodel was awful .
barely ate any .
barely ate any .
the fried polenta was ok , but a bit dry .
barely ate any .
this place is overpriced , poor menu design and flat out unimpressive .
considering the price tag , i expected a lot more .
the food was delivered quickly and everything was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
would n't you send a manager over ?
if you 're cowboy ciao , the answer to all of these is no .
my tongue is still smoking ... in a bad way .
it looked like a pile of left overs .
i did n't get our servers name , but he was cordial and efficient .
it really was just awful though .
_num_ star for food but _num_ for service .
very disappointing .
average service , horrible food .
when i heard about cowboy ciao i was excited to try it .
i wish i had bread so we could eat the sauce .
this is why i gave it _num_ stars .
cowboy ciao ... well ... no .
we had some small plates just to test the waters at this place .
what a complete disappointment .
the chopped salad was nice for about _num_ bites , then it got boring .
so boring i could barely taste it after the 4th bite .
dry , flavorless with a hint of spice .
boring .
no real cheese flavor , totally disappointed but ate it anyway .
not good at all .
overall , totally disappointed .
this could possibly be the worst experience i 've ever had at a restaurant .
do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else .
unfortunately , the staff was n't nearly as excited to see us .
it was awful .
and the potatoes were slightly undercooked and not hot .
we chose to skip desert .
arrowhead grill in glendale blows this away for this price point .
will not be back .
one wonders who was the priority ... .
not for picky eaters !
im one , ill admit .
not only that , but it was really warm in there .
it was literally cooler outside when we left than it was in the restaurant .
not a good sign on a hot summer night .
did i mention that it was just _num_ of us dining ?
when i got a promotion , we went to cowboy ciao .
i have never been disappointed .
bland .
that 's all i really know from my end of the table .
the services overall was terribly slow even as the restaurant was beginning to empty .
service was slow .
very painful !
the service was atrocious -- grossly disorganized , slow , unbelievable .
very disappointed by that .
i 'm not a fan of cowboy ciao .
neither of us liked it very much .
you could n't even taste the steak because of the gravy taste .
the worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant .
we had a group of _num_ and we could not hear each other talking .
he went into the kitchen after the meal and thanked the cook ) .
no dice this time .
the host returned and told us a _num_ hour wait .
twice in _num_ week you have really let me down .
i ordered take out , chopped salad and a short rib dinner .
when i got it home it was a chopped salad and shirt rib risotto .
and our drinks are almost always empty and the servers are hard to find .
the quesadilla was amazing , i wish i ordered _num_ more for my entree !
i hope the profit was worth it , i 'll never be back .
i could serve these plates out of my own kitchen .
take your money elsewhere .
i was turned off by the faux wall artwork .
it 's hard to explain what it was like being there .
highly disappointed .
we are wine drinkers and gave up on bottles .
this year , we chose cowboy ciao .
the service was not great and seriously the food is lacking !
this particular occasion was a serious disappointment .
the food came out lukewarm at best .
food took quite awhile , and when it arrived was barely warm .
bourbon maple butter had no bourbon or maple flavor .
i had buffalo style shrimp with blue cheese grits .
looked more like an app than entree .
shrimp ok , grits cold with no blue cheese flavor .
husbands chicken wrap was boring and uninspired .
sad to see such a great restaurant go downhill .
was excited to try it .
it was just ok.
disappointing selections .
split the chopped salad and reuben .
meat was very fatty and huge chunks .
no ordering a rusty nail to go with those awesome mushrooms .
our drinks took a while to get and one of them was forgotten twice .
the food that was suppose to be hot was luke warm .
service is very very slow .
took _num_ hours to get outta there and it was n't very busy .
no love here , wo n't be back ... .
$ _num_ later .
service was horrible !
finally were able to order and the food was pretty good .
both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal .
normally i would never tip below _num_ % + .
too expensive , too loud , and very outdated .
drab and even a little dirty feeling .
felt like i was walking into a cave .
fortunately i got out with out with only the tiger shrimp appetizer .
unfortunately , the meal was disappointing .
the first shrimp course was cold , overcooked , chewy and flavorless .
in any event , we will not be back to cowboy ciao .
free mimosa = just ok mimosa .
anyway , we get our bill and the first mimosa was free .
i have no problem paying for my mimosas but these were average at best .
my husband and i ate here with his parents saturday .
the restaurant was half empty when we placed our order .
it took another _num_ for our main .
so disappointing .
round _num_ - restaurant week again !
this time around i was quite disappointed .
the texture was just fine , but in the end too much salt .
ambiance is very mediocre and nothing special .
do n't make the same mistake we did by going to this one .
filet mignon : worst filet mignon we have ever had !
the filet mignon that we got was very fatty .
none of these options were available .
wine list was extensive though .
firstly , the decor certainly did n't `` wow '' me .
we ordered the chopped salad , the chicken and waffles and the scallops .
the chicken and waffles was half of one waffle with one small chicken breast .
appalling .
so disappointing .
have to say i was really disappointed with my experience .
it took _num_ minutes to get a couple glasses of water .
the waiter was distracted with side conversations with the kitchen staff .
we had girl 's night dinner here and had a horrible experience .
she was not very attentive .
we waited _num_ minutes after we finished our dinner to get our check .
she rolled her eyes and walked away .
there are hardly any vegetarian options and no vegan options .
my friend and i went here during restaurant week .
my complaint is that the portion size was smaller for the restaurant week menu .
tonight 's was far off the mark .
third , the food was cold .
fourth , service was slow .
fifth , the food was not good .
sorry cowboy ciao , we 're done giving you our business .
there are far too many other great restaurants for me to bother coming back .
the total bill for _num_ was $ _num_ with no alcohol !
no one at our table could understand much of what he said .
chopped salad was delish but steak and lamb were both tough .
lost points though for adding in an auto gratuity for subpar service ) .
that was probably the perk of the whole night .
is n't us complaining a hostess ' cue to get the manager over ?
apparently not ... because the manager was mia , too .
from the very beginning we experienced lackluster service .
however , nothing was offered to us period .
not a free drink , discount , etc .
our waiter did n't even offer his apologies .
our group of _num_ went here after having good experiences in the past .
the hostess was rude and impatient , and our server was inept .
bad answer and poor recovery .
wo n't be back .
i went here on a saturday night with a group of _num_ .
super disappointing for a $ _num_ steak .
the only saving grace was that the chopped salad was delicious .
with out a doubt at one time a place to go .
not anymore , felt dingy , dated , and close to dirty .
fixtures are original over twenty years ago and have not been updated or cleaned .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
this is shocking as they are not a `` seafood '' restaurant .
it took another _num_ minutes for our food to be served .
unfortunately , this place is a little pretentious for my liking .
too bad !
overall , not enjoyable .
it was just so-so .
rob was an absolute tool when trying to cancel reservation within an hour .
i will not be going there again !
tourist trap feeling .
we wo n't be going back or recommending .
she informed me that they needed the table by 8:30 .
do n't you just hate being wrong ?
the food was decent , but there was nothing special about the drinks .
the women 's bathroom had _num_ stall working out of _num_ .
total disappointment !
poor service , food really was sub-par for what we paid .
the service and chop salad was the only great thing here .
we were very disappointed with the exotic mushroom and lamb chops .
both items were bland and over cooked .
unfortunately we did n't enjoy the scallops or shrimp dish on the starters menu .
the shrimp was also horribly over cooked .
if i could give negative stars here , i would !
however , we had my nearly one year old baby with us at dinner .
when in scottsdale , might as well go to nordstrom rack .
was just completely ignored for fifteen minutes at the men 's sunglasses case .
not impressed .
or maybe that 's just a waste of time .
the coat did not fit well so i returned it .
i mentioned that i had not even been billed for that as yet .
i love nordstrom , let me start off my saying that .
i sat there for _num_ seconds , got up and left .
nordstrom this has been a trend for you .
handed me the shoe and walked away .
i had a horrible experience in the children 's section at this location .
the sales associate insisted free alterations are included with every purchase .
most places typically charge $ _num_ with a one week turnaround .
if i wanted terrible service , i 'd have gone to target .
the people who work there are so so so so so rude .
disappointed in the shoe department .
unfortunately tonight , that was not the case !
never have i been told no and had the representative just rudely walk away !
in the same department , my intention was to purchase another watch as well .
shame on you , nordstrom !
however , today i had the most utterly disgusting experience of my entire life .
i thought it was utterly rude that he would think that of me entirely .
he is not a worthy representation of the nordstrom team .
not a conversation i would have with customers around .
i have always hated you .
their beans were pretty dry and nothing to get excited about .
let me begin by saying i was really looking forward to this place .
in summary : disappointing .
my brother goes up to the counter and asks what machaca is .
`` um , no i 've lived here most of my life . ''
my bro got a chicken enchilada and a machaca taco .
the rice was pretty flavorless ; white and cheap .
so the burro was a disappointment , what about the chips and salsa ?
the salsa was more like spicy tomato paste .
price : $ _num_ for this meal ?
shoot , i would go to chipotle over this place any day .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
i had a veggie burro and hubby had cheese enchiladas .
way too pricy for what you actually get , for sure .
never will i go back to this place .
my order was wrong and it was way too expensive .
i ordered a chicken taco , but i 've had much better .
also , the owner was really , really rude and unfriendly .
i have n't had service this bad in awhile .
this place is just ... ick .
it 's not great .
i would n't recommend it .
the food was nothing to write home about .
it was served on styrofoam plates and the customer service was lacking .
very rude , not deserving of our business .
i thought he was kidding but he was actually annoyed that i wanted delivery .
places like this do not deserve our business .
$ _num_ total .
the hot sauce was watered down no flavor but hot .
would not go back !
plus , he got his _num_ % tip !
and , to top it off , threw out the food .
awful customer service .
it was n't super flavorful and i felt it was a bit too greasy .
ugh , i 'm done with this place .
i had the machaca burro supreme tonight .
the meat was somewhat spicy , but overall it was bland .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
i will just pick up taco bell next time .
overall do n't waste your money and your palette .
i also ordered the plain cheese crisp .
it was a pinch of cheese in between two _num_ ' corn tortillas .
and i feel like i got ripped off .
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
the burro was small for $ _num_ and not very filling .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
i will miss the tamales .
never again ... .
at _num_ i ordered online .
bad business .
by _num_ , it still was not here .
worst customer service i have ever received !
the food is ok but the service just sucked .
no cheese .
extremely unprofessional and disappointing .
the owner could n't even look me in the eye .
apparently they were understaffed , as if that was an acceptable excuse .
do n't waste your time if you need a dependable catering option .
i ordered _num_ beef tacos .
i was disgusted !
surprisingly the beans were the best part even though they were not great .
i would n't go back .
i do n't usually bother to rate places i do n't like .
this is the most pathetic excuse for dining there is .
life is too short to eat crap .
totally disappointed .
i was disgusted .
sorry i to vent but i was livid .
bleh , sorry denny 's but i 'm not a fan .
the food is awful .
this is the worst food ever .
white trash people you now have another gathering spot besides the greyhound bus terminals .
we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
my lemonade was not refilled the entire time .
everything on my plate , a regular slam , is cold .
i left , no charge .
upset enough to drive to ihop _num_ miles away .
_num_ out of _num_ , would not eat here again .
management at this location is terrible .
stopped here sunday morning for a quick breakfast .
there was nothing good about this breakfast at all .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated at a time with plenty of open tables .
it 's now _num_ minutes after i ordered and still no food .
the kid is definitely odd and a bit rude , i.e .
inattentive service and dirty too .
unacceptable !
this is nothing but a greedy money making scam .
i had to go to the front counter to get my drinks refilled .
im fucking sick of people being greedy and money hungry .
ive never scammed anyone .
however the rest have been horrible .
i was n't given ice or a straw with my lemonade .
needless to say we left without eating but with time wasted .
bottom line go somewhere else , it 's not worth it .
she said to me that i 'm supposed to tip on to go orders .
totally ridiculous and so rude !
of course i 'm not going to with that attitude .
you lost customers for life .
horrible experience .
who closes for maintenance ?
standard denny 's fare .
i got my food a little after 5:00 so that sucked .
_num_ hours should mean you can expect at least some minimum level of service .
took about _num_ minutes to serve me a double cheese burger .
they did n't seem to be to busy .
a recent trip to the scottsdale location did n't live up to those memories .
i probably wo n't go back to this location .
for breakfast ?
they make their pancakes with peanut oil .
which makes me sad , because i 'm allergic to peanuts .
but no , i think they truly earned a _num_ .
they may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me .
after about _num_ minutes , my pancake arrives .
steve 's meal took another _num_ minute to come .
my food would have been cold if i was polite enough to wait .
our service was also pitiful .
$ _num_ later we boxed up the food only to throw it away .
wo n't waste my time again .
i arrived there at 10:30 and there was no line to get in .
do n't bother with this place .
no melon ... strawberries and bananas .
for me to drink my latte while i wait ? )
no credit cards .
no firearms .
no outside drinks allowed in .
no to go orders on weekends & holidays .
no smoking .
the hosted threw mad amounts of attitude to my very pregnant friend .
please do not give your money to this establishment .
horrible the worst service .
no take out .
terrible attitude .
no english speaking .
hated it !
good food but a terrible experience .
they wo n't seat you unless your entire party is there .
disappointed !
place needs a deep cleaning and training in customer service .
i hate it when it takes _num_ minutes to get a cup of coffee .
i hate it when your server speaks barely enough english to get by .
this location is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
there is an atm that charges a $ _num_ fee , yay .
what a disappointment .
pancakes were n't bad , but like i said earlier , nothing special .
one of the hashbrowns was forgotten .
the next morning , we drove a little further and found a cracker barrel .
for what they charge , yes portions are a bit on the small side .
the other time , i ordered bacon pancakes which were just ok .
may come back here , may not .
i 've been to _num_ different original pancake house locations .
this location sucks .
the manager is a dishonest dealer .
the services was unfriendly to say the least .
the no credit cards accepted is a bit ridiculous in this day .
would i visit again ?
made the mistake of eating here twice .
the bacon , the pancakes , and fresh squeezed orange juice were great .
the negatives above do n't make it worth the extensive wait for a table .
i 'll take ihop any day of the week over this silly place .
ugh .
i ca n't eat green pepper so i asked for the potatoes without them .
we decided to still try it and the food was not good at all .
rather they charge you double for this luxury .
they burned my eggs .
i never had a place burn my eggs before .
the food here is mediocre at best .
the ones here came with a brown crust and were obviously overcooked .
no , i 'll pass on this one .
we were looking forward to eating here this morning , then everything went wrong .
this restaurant does not even get close to meeting expectations .
very , very disappointing !
disappointment just begins to describe my experience .
we were already feeling rushed at this point .
again ... obviously rushed .
the waitress was a little friendlier , but not much .
it 's very small inside , the atmosphere is rather boring and bland .
it was `` regular '' waffle and not belgian which was great !
anyways , the coffee was sub-par and the waffle was stone cold .
she did n't charge me for coffee .
i would not return , i was not impressed .
i would give this place less than _num_ star if it were possible .
this particular locations food made me sick .
one bite and i was in the restroom throwing up .
i only said that it made me sick .
we thought because it was just 11:30 we would try it .
the food was a _num_ , the service was _num_ .
like i did , be prepared for disappointment .
which they said she was rude .
just for the rudeness they get a _num_ star forever .
oh one more thing this place hates cell phones .
i like diners and this feels like an old time diner .
the way i was treated by the hostess made me turn around and leave .
but she gave me the push i needed to find something better .
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
the food is super bland , over priced and over-cooked .
absolute garbage food .
_num_ bites out of each and we could stomach no more .
went to try this restaurant after passing it so many time .
it is pricey for the place and the service was not that great .
seriously disappointed by the coffee - in an old fashioned coffee house ?
feel ripped off much ?
food is mediocre .
the service starts at bad and goes downhill from there .
she already seemed irritated but apparently my question put her over the edge .
they have good art , but horrible customer service .
what a horrible impression .
get new staff , they were just terrible !
how can a bowling alley be so awful ?
everything about it was lousy .
really not all that happy with the experience we had tonight .
it 's creepy .
unbelievable .
thats what i have to say about scottsdale lanes this saturday morning .
( customer service is not there specialty ) .
so i throw a ball down the lane .
now there are _num_ balls stuck in the pit on lanes _num_ & _num_ .
talk about lousy customer service .
what a terrible place to go bowling .
this place has terrible customer service and lousy employees that work there .
the current price was $ _num_ ( cheaper , yay ! )
for unlimited bowling for only _num_ hours .
we were all disappointed , but it was n't too big of a deal .
the end of our two hours comes and we get brought the bill .
not as much as i expected , but everything was on one bill .
what an unpleasant experience that was !
do n't blame us , we asked for separate bills .
there was no reason for any of them to have acted as they did .
this is unacceptable prices for a bowling alley .
i also ordered _num_ beer and that was almost $ _num_ .
no wonder there was only like _num_ people in the entire alley .
i will not be returning .
the male staff , on the other hand , has to wear santa hats .
um , hello , how is that fair ?
i can no longer recommend the jeweler which is a shame .
we had a very disappointing experience with this jeweler .
left message for owner , never heard from him .
never followed up on the order .
never shows up and no one calls .
do not pay them any $ up front , it will be lost .
left message for owner , never heard from him .
they had no clue about their merchandise .
this was the only card i brought in .
i feel bad for his employees .
the worst customer service here ever .
the employees at this store have attitude .
they sold me two pair which were not long enough .
told me that was the longest they had and that was what i needed .
who wants to hear that crap .
they do n't even know where nike is located .
trash !
this place is a waste of time .
the website is even worse .
this is just a poorly run company .
the phone rang _num_ times before they picked up .
no wonder this place has all one star reviews .
not calling back and not going to this location .
no way , no how .
worst experience i 've ever had .
this place was very dirty .
it also has a very bad smell inside .
there is only one barber and he needs a haircut himself .
he is not professional at all , his services sucks .
i will not be going back to here .
arizona school of real estate gives you _num_ different study guides .
this school was a total waste of a lot of time and money .
when you test , you do not know what you get wrong .
just be prepared to be sitting in old uncomfortable chairs .
then when the a/c goes on it gets so cold you need a jacket .
excuse me ?
no thank you , no goodbye , nothing .
needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
god help , i have no idea why .
the woman was helping another customer , the young girl standing around .
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
there was a woman helping a customer at the counter where i was browsing .
she never looked back in my direction .
i find that very odd .
none of those bitches would work for me .
though the waiting room is large , it 's often standing room only .
and waiting outside in july is not exactly a nice alternative .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
the check-in process seems overly complicated .
soap .
that 's how bad this guy 's morning was going .
it does n't mean i like the place all that much .
complete lack of respect for one 's time .
grab a beer .
the `` burger bar '' was a disaster .
except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps .
it was dirty , nasty the previous time .
did n't seem as dirty .
ok , but nothing special at all .
the fries were n't great either .
first in _num_ , when they were recommended for my wedding dress alterations .
i returned home and a couple of hours later decided to check the repairs .
i was fairly offended that i had just been called a liar .
she responded with `` no no that 's not what she said . ''
_num_ stars for the work .
minus _num_ stars because the service was poor and the prices are outrageous .
needless to say i will be searching for another tailor .
called and left a message that the heater in my phoenix house had quit .
the owner and staff is absolutely unprofessional and rude .
i absolutely can not believe this place is in business .
they ruined my dogs hair .
so unhappy i cant even tell you .
he was so pissed off because he knew his hair looked horrible .
plus , it is expensive .
i 'm only giving _num_ so i can write this review .
happy hour might be a winner , but the regular dinner is a disappointment .
but when it comes to full priced dinners ... go elsewhere .
the place is decorated like a claim jumper .
the pepper rub was so overpowering that i couldnt eat but two bites .
it was not worth the $ _num_ dollars .
so boring , skip this review now .
my waiter needed training in basic portions .
the atmosphere was like anything i would expect from a corporate concept restaurant .
if you like boring corporate cookie cutter ideas ... this is your place .
the macaroni and cheese is so-so .
boring !
be sure to check your food because there not !
not worth $ _num_ !
no way .
it could have been cooked for a few hours longer .
skip the entrees !
our server was really not good , he was extremely slow and inattentive .
he walked off .
the mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like nothing ... .
totally flavorless .
ugh .
the bf 's short ribs were also very meh .
they were bone in ( really ?
they could n't take the bone out for _num_ $ hmmm ) .
furthermore , the mac and cheese was really not good either .
not so much .
worst service i have ever received .
rarely saw our waitress , especially when she was needed .
when i did see her , she was rude and never smiled .
they did however pay for that dish , but i will not be back .
sunday brunch was a huge disappointment .
the fried chicken was like eating leather .
big disappointment .
very unpleasant dinning experience .
we have had much better steak elsewhere .
i am still very unsatisfied with this company .
on the plus side the manager stopped by to apologize .
plus - he recovered quickly and graciously said he was buying our drinks .
meh more or less sums up my experience .
our appetizer came out only moments before our food .
needless to say we 're never coming back .
do n't understand the 3-5 stars for this place .
he did not need to do it .
i went to the restroom to cool off , i was so annoyed .
the food was shockingly hot and fast out the kitchen .
everyone that tried a bite said if was very `` strong '' .
my husband got the halibut special , it was a little dry .
overall , was expecting more from this place .
such an arrogant manager !
it is very rude and inappropriate .
it is _num_ mile south !
the hostess , the first and last impression was horrible .
her attitude stuck out the whole meal .
we find a table quickly and our bar waitress was not helpful at all .
the margarita was gross .
told the waitress , her response ... sorry .
for dinner , i ordered the pork tenderloin with mexican street corn and grits .
so , our check showed two steaks , with one written off .
she comes back and says , no the bill is right .
but this was a bad experience !
i have _num_ emails , _num_ call and we are all set .
he says no , your reserved seating is inside here .
missed opportunity .
no reservation , no problem .
pretentious much ?
the big ass burger was , in fact , quite large .
and dry as hell ( suck ! )
everything else i could 've done without .
maybe i 'll give you another try , roaring fork .
my friend and i showed up for easter brunch only to be turned away .
disgusting regard for customers , i 've never felt so insulted .
the service was very spotty .
i was really disappointed this evening .
_num_ of the _num_ had the fixed price and had given their dessert order .
however , the portions were very small .
the service was where our family was greatly disappointed .
really a shame .
the burger was very dry .
to top it off , the service was bad .
was he thinking that we were not going to get any food ?
the receptionist claimed she did n't have my reservation , despite my email confirmation .
we were not brought menus .
would not go back .
noisy beyond belief .
needless to say we were very disappointed in our dinner .
we have eaten here before but this time it was not worth it .
_num_ minutes after our reservation time we were finally seated .
we probably wo n't come back .
real disappointment .
menu is very limited .
service was terrible .
food was served to us cold and was not very good .
waiter had a snooty attitude .
way too expensive .
came here for my birthday dinner with family and was disappointed with the service .
unfortunately he was n't friendly , attentive , or patient at all .
each time he stopped by our table i felt rushed .
he seemed annoyed when we asked questions and rushed through the specials .
i did n't end up ordering dessert because the vibe just was n't comforting .
it 's a bummer that our dining experience was n't very pleasant or inviting .
i was thoroughly disappointed by the entree , however .
this place was terrible !
food was okay ... atmosphere was cool but the service was the worst !
fun environment .
huge disappointment !
wo n't be returning .
visited during restaurant week .
the food was mediocre at best .
too pricey for average food .
i wo n't be back .
they are going downhill .
food was a disappointment .
this has always been one of my favorite scottsdale restaurants .
however tonight was a different experience .
it was bland and tasteless .
the green chili macaroni and cheese was overcooked and mushy .
this must 've been a not so good night in the kitchen .
maybe the winter chef goes north once summer comes ?
i was sorely disappointed tonight .
ugh ... if you need something printed just go next door to office depot .
these people are slow and lack the technology to print a variety of documents .
probably not going to be a repeat customer .
turns out they had n't even looked at my car yet .
they also said it could be something else that cost _num_ .
so it must be an $ _num_ repair thing .
not so much these days .
then we got there to pick it up and the front grill was gone .
there was oil dripping from the filter and oil pan and even the transmission .
the post he put in was too big and too deep .
he referred me to a very expensive specialist to fix it .
the post he put in was too big and too deep .
he referred me to a very expensive specialist to fix it .
this family is a disgrace to the art business .
pool area is not terrible , but not great either .
the breakfast looks reasonable upon purchase but is far better at other budget hotels .
that was the start of the not so good weekend .
i then tried to shower and could not get hot water out .
he asked me why and i told them all you have is carbs .
so i wandered around looking for someone or for what to do .
i sat for _num_ minutes after my appointment time .
they looked like i lost my mind when i complained and left !
the service was just as bad !
she clearly was not interested in helping a returning customer .
received a mexican pizza with no sour cream , and a regular taco .
seems to be the trend at most fast food places now a days .
ridiculous .
this is ridiculous nonsense !
do n't let these people walk all over you because of their mistakes !
the worst taco bell i have ever been to .
sadly it never does !
everything on the menu taste bland .
um , ok ?
effing gross !
i just feel bad that has to work with girls like that .
that is seriously irritating .
i couldnt take it , no going back for me .
she told me `` umm , probably $ _num_ . ''
fine , sure , not at all what i wanted , but okay .
i ended up doing _num_ pieces for $ _num_ .
disappointing .
she completely rushed and did not make the experience worth the price at all .
well , i was wrong again .
i wish i could take back the tip i originally gave her .
i was being too nice .
this was my 1st visit .
she was wrong .
are not my style .
the actual results were not that bad .
not sure what or how many creatures are living under there .
i brushed it off as the lighting and went home .
a total rip off .
that 's probably how the holes became so .
sometimes , it does n't .
i was told that this was one of the best dry cleaners in scottsdale .
nothing great , nothing terrible .
you have a job that probably sucks , but guess what ?
they have it worse off than you .
sadly ... it wo n't be mine .
i really hate feeling cheated .
please use this dry cleaners if you enjoy wasting your time .
admittedly , i am in fact angry .
the worst dry cleaners i have ever been to !
seriously , do not take your clothing to them !
i would give them negative stars if i could .
unless you do n't care what your clothes look like , save yourself .
the first problem happened with my fianc 's business shirts .
there were absolutely no stains on my sweater prior to dropping it off .
never got an apology from him , nothing .
so annoyed .
this place sucks .
never had that kind of reaction before going to this dry cleaners .
worst review for the worst drying cleaning i have experienced .
he agreed with me and paid me the fair value of the shirt .
they had a chance to land a client but failed on the first try .
i 'm beyond disappointed with this establishment .
ordered _num_ california burritos and it was disgusting .
ordered carne asada fries and it tasted like mush as well .
fries were soggy and everything else was lacking flavor .
worst part ?
so you know it was probably pretty bad !
and how did my bill end up being $ _num_ for _num_ items ?
do n't eat here .
i do n't think that there is any way i 'd return though .
this place sucks .
meat tastes like straight asshole !
terrible customer service !
terrible prices !
terrible everything .
i immediately lost my appetite !
i would n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
guess he assumed i would n't understand .
this was the worst place i have ever ate at .
the salsa tasted like nasty .
it tasted like it was watered down with sewer water .
it was ok need some seasoning for sure .
got no guacamole .
it 's better anyway !
it was the worst night i have stayed at any hotel .
for the money i paid it should have been a _num_ star experience .
looking old and tired .
half pepperoni , half chicken pesto .
the pizza was cold .
toppings were not very flavorful .
do n't get me wrong , i appreciate a free meal .
i 'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast !
i was drunk when i ate here .
the sicilian was garbage .
$ _num_ for _num_ slices .
i will never again use this pizza place again in my life .
this was not an isolated incident either this happened multiple times .
i should have stuck to my gut feeling and ordered pizza .
but ... no , i decided why not see how their other food is .
bad idea .
my cheese steak was practically empty .
there was about _num_ % bread going on here .
what little meat there was , was n't horrible .
they were wet and limp with no flavor at all .
the texture was just weird .
little pieces of garlic heaven .
previously , we 've eaten here late night and had delicious pizza .
i got the chicken parm delivered .
it was n't so hot .
horrible .
even my _num_ year old son said so upon his first bite .
the food was delivered after _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
apparently they do n't do complete refunds , which makes _num_ sense .
when the pizza did arrive , it was cold and the box was smashed .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
buzzed or not , that long line can sure be annoying ... .
the pizza just is n't that impressive .
too greasy , and pretty bland , to be honest .
it was n't terrible , but i regretted ordering from this restaurant .
horrible !
this place sucks .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
avoid this place at all costs .
i really hesitate to say anything about pizza .
but i officially hate joes .
this place is creepy .
hire private security like every other establishment .
no thanks .
chicken fingers no flavor .
nothing good to say and spent over _num_ feel burned .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
save your money & your patience .
walked in , no greeting , `` what can i get for you ? ''
received my _num_ slices that tasted no better than a reheated slice of pizza .
pizza was soggy & greasy .
do n't waste your $ $ going here !
very disappointing .
trying to beat the late night rush .
i was told _num_ min .
what could have made it take more than _num_ times as long ?
my answer is not my problem .
the crust is too buttery and not crispy or chewy .
this is a failed attempt at a ny slice .
i could n't even finish my second slice .
it just tasted bad .
customer service means a lot and joes does not have it .
thats the only positive thing i can say about joes .
got an order of cheese fries and they were disgusting !
the fries were soggy with no seasoning .
i would not order from here in the future .
it was room temp and basically a bucket of grease .
completely terrible service .
horrible .
this is not new york pizza .
i am from new york city and this place is horrible !
no pizza i 've ever ate has been this bad .
i paid _num_ dollars for a slice that tasted like cardboard .
worst pizza i 've ever had .
ordered a pizza last night from these clowns .
the wings were well ... mediocre .
for some odd reason i ordered chicken parm .
thrown into the trash , nothing good about it .
they get _num_ stars because the pizza looked amazing .
everyone was very rude with me .
sorry if that 's too much for you to take on .
minimum orders suck , but so do minimum restaurant sales .
i ordered a _num_ dollar sandwich and was charged _num_ .
idiots .
just fyi to the employees , not everyone that comes here is drunk .
i asked for _num_ slices of pizza to go , which is extra .
paid for ranch , but got none .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
that 's why i have them _num_ stars .
the worst pizza ever eaten .
the toppings all slipped from the crust when picking up a piece .
they also gave free garlic rolls with the order .
i had ordered online to make sure my order was not messed up .
it was awful !
even my kids could n't eat it .
it tasted like a reheated frozen pizza .
the taste was awful and it was so hard to chew .
it was gross !
terrible !
tonight it was like eating cardboard .
this piece of cardboard was n't worth more than $ _num_ .
hardly a new york style pizza .
if i could give them no stars , i would .
i ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and coke .
the meal is supposed to come with a small salad and garlic bread .
the woman takes my number , and says she 'll have somebody call me .
no salad .
_num_ minutes later i get an angry knock at the door .
maybe i 'll try again but i 'll walk next time .
too bad crust does n't deliver .
really upsetting !
tonight just really ruined it for me .
i ordered my pizza and left in the comments to add ranch and buffalo .
he just said its not on the receipt when it clearly states so .
literally stale at this point .
horrible customer service .
after calling back the woman who has an accent had a rude tone .
well huge disappointment .
really not good food .
pizza with tomatoes and spinach sounded awesome .
actually , no ... it was pretty flavorless even when we reheated it .
the mac and cheese was literally a few noodles and some watery cheese sauce .
very gross .
but do n't try this garbage sober .
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
i wish i could leave more stars .
but the delivery is late every single time .
and then my average pizza is simply cold , late average pizza .
and that 's just not worth the $ $ when your starving .
ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
not anymore !
joes sucks now , spend your money else where .
bad customer service and subpar food .
after waiting _num_ hrs we called to check on our order .
they had n't even made it yet !
staff was not friendly to begin with .
the worst pizza we 've ever eaten .
spend your money somewhere else !
ordered delivery tonight .
the food was a huge disappointment for the wait and price .
they put sausage on the whole pizza .
the garlic knots we ordered were terrible and had no taste .
vary bad customer service for delivery .
worst service ever pizza never arrived .
the lady on the phone was so rude she even hang up the phone .
just got some pizza take out for dinner , nothing crazy .
honestly it was n't very good at all .
i have no idea what kind of crack people are smoking in phoenix .
as for me , i wish my food was bland .
gross .
the first signs should be been telling .
and surely enough , the food sucked !
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
to start , malee 's atmosphere was not bad .
the food was ok , nothing special .
cockroaches , however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant .
i requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem .
needless to say , i will never go back here again .
the noodles were too rubbery and the flavors were pretty standard .
it was all vodka , and no sake .
waste of money .
boy was i wrong .
first thing you should know is that malee 's is not traditional thai food .
the rolls were messy and the cooking oil was dripping out of them .
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
the coco chile fish was oily and not spicy .
although both dishes were somewhat tasty , they simply did n't hit the mark .
needless to say , we decided to pass on dessert and head home .
do yourself a favor and try other local thai restaurants .
i also worry about cleanliness .
but maybe the main courses of red curry and pad thai would be great .
wrong .
i do n't even want to waste time typing about the curry .
the basil crispy chicken just did n't work for me .
the pad thai was very average .
we were meeting old friends that we meet on a cruise .
i ca n't talk for everyone except for my husband and i .
the restaurant was n't full so i do n't get it.
the bill was way too high for such mediocre food .
so i went again last saturday with my wife and it was awful .
for sure the worst duck i ever had .
must have been dead for a long , long time .
with the foul taste in my mouth , we passed on the desert .
quite a disappointment .
not going there again .
i guess in dc they have significantly better thai .
sorry to say we did not .
i felt a little like i 'd been put in the back _num_ .
not wowed .
no thanks .
$ _num_ plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere ?
they have no idea what they are missing out on .
it ended up costing $ _num_ for _num_ people .
furthermore , the soup was too thick and was more like a stew .
the soup base itself was far too sweet .
y'all already know what your girl , angela ordered .
for it being on the lunch special menu , it was pretty pricey .
$ _num_ for a decent portion + choice of soup or salad .
very , very dry .
skip this place !
dry , gummy , yuck .
i also tried the combo app .
the soup was too salty and heavy and the panang chicken was kinda blend .
i 've had it better at a chinese restaurant in co .
it was a slap in the face on so many levels .
the food was not spectacular .
we ordered pad thai , was very dry but not horrible .
do n't come here if you 're looking for authentic thai food .
she recommended crispy basil chicken .
did not enjoy that all .
the chicken was not my favorite .
not good !
it has really gone downhill .
bad food , terrible service and an overall disappointment .
it is thai food in scottsdale .
however , usually , the pad thai is good .
not in this case .
overall , the food is too salty and too saucy .
honestly i was a little disappointed before i even sat down for dinner .
so once seated , service was super slow , tap water , really ?
ordered the thai pad , it was mushy and so tasteless .
this place was not good .
i would n't recommend it to anyone .
the only thing thai about malee 's are the owners .
this place is expensive , and not worth the price .
the wait for the soup was _num_ min .
it was ok but not great .
it took another _num_ min to get the main course .
it was as spicy as i ordered it , but somehow tasteless .
overall , a disappointment .
green peppercorn shrimp and calamari has got to be the house joke .
not kidding .
shame on you .
you could n't have put less effort into this dish if you tried .
i 'm in the industry too , i know how it goes !
this was unacceptable !
sad we did n't even get to try the food !
we had reservations so there was no surprise big group showing up .
then we waited ... _num_ minutes , _num_ minutes .
mediocre overpriced thai !
i have sent maybe _num_ plates back in my adult life .
i sent this back and the waitress just took it and walked off .
just left and took it off the bill .
love phx but this is just another hyped up average girl next door .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
i do n't know why so many people recommend it .
boring and overpriced .
really , you can not make a basic staple dish of thailand ?
for some reason we were served brown rice , not jasmine rice , odd .
by far the worst thai food i have had .
i would have done better getting an instant thai meal at the grocery store .
me and two girlfriends went to malee 's for lunch .
it was not made to order .
came out way too fast .
the lunch was not even warm in temp .
are you sure you did not get mine ?
what a disappointment .
probably wo n't be going back .
i was really , really disappointed with this place .
i love thai food , i would eat it every night if i could .
my first clue should have been when the girl asked `` how spicy ? ''
so really hot ? ''
no ... no ... just no .
the fish candy was blah .
it was like they had dumped chili powder into it .
chili powder does not go in thai food .
the rice was also very dry .
$ _num_ for freaking take-out for _num_ people .
overall , it was n't offensive but i will never go back .
mediocre thai food .
not sure where the _num_ stars came from .
horribly disappointed .
both dishes were greasy and flavorless .
never , never again .
mediocre at best .
neither was spectacular .
the fish was fried ok , but that 's not rocket science .
does n't taste authentic at all .
the food is not that authentic .
the sauces are too thick , salty and not subtle .
they use the wrong white rice , short grain instead of jasmine .
terrible pad thai .
just terrible .
worst pad thai i 've ever had .
service was n't that great either .
panang curry - the flavor was ok but it was too watery .
this was the most disappointing dish we ordered .
it was like me ordering spaghetti but they served me fettuccine alfredo .
sesame chicken salad with noodles .
i did n't even care to try this dish .
nothing about it was thai .
however , the food is not quite thai food .
the best thai food is of course in los angeles thai town .
personally , today for me , i just consumed wasted calories lol .
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
although he offered me a gift certificate , i declined .
i was calm , but told him i was disappointed .
the beef broccoli was not our favorite as it was sweet .
i 've eaten here twice and just honestly not a fan .
when we mentioned it , the hostess looked confused , but took it away .
but we never had a waiter come by to take an order .
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
someone else probably walked out before us because they were never served !
for the money , you 're better off going elsewhere .
nothing special not sure what the fuss is all about .
did n't really do anything for me .
wo n't come back .
i will not be going back .
no drinks , appetizers , etc .
tables all around us were being served but not us .
terrible service .
my go-to thai order is panang curry .
also be advised that malee 's charges scottsdale prices .
those $ _num_ entrees you 're used to will be at least $ _num_ .
no , sorry , that 's not ok .
none came , we waited five more minutes .
still nothing , so we left .
food : bland , nowhere near authentic .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
tom yum : was possibly the worst i have ever had !
we will not dine here again .
the hostess was rude .
i have to say i am thoroughly disappointed .
i expected much more from a restaurant on main street in scottsdale .
i spent two years in thailand and seek out thai restaurants across the us .
the service itself was quite nice , but the food was lacking .
the crab rangoons were nothing special .
do n't waste your time with this one .
this place was over priced americanized thai food .
honestly the only appetizing meal was the stir fry .
my dish also had little hard pieces in it .
will i return to restaurant ?
we walked out .
, but the curry itself was a disaster .
my group and i were completely blown away by his response .
for one , it was very unprofessional and two , very out of line .
the meat was bland .
my boyfriend 's pad see ew was kind of dry .
my pad thai had chicken , shrimp , and tofu .
the chicken was overcooked , though i liked the shrimp and the tofu .
it tasted closer to tomato sauce with fish sauce than anything else .
overpriced .
not authentic .
bad .
the entire meal cost $ _num_ .
you 'd pay only $ _num_ at any other thai restaurant .
if i had paid $ _num_ it would 've been too much .
try the place in thomas just west of scottsdale rd .
horrible .
i 've had better thai food in mexico .
really bland .
only flavor was ketchup .
terrible .
options are very limited .
i was quite disappointed .
if i could give zero stars i would .
do not buy from these people .
they are not trustworthy and will steal from you as they did me .
this place is disgusting .
first off , the guy wo n't make any special orders for his customers .
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
i asked if he was being sarcastic and he said he was n't .
it will probably go out of business soon anyways .
it says $ _num_ delivery and i wanted to order a burrito .
i could not have this done because i apparently was not spending enough .
mind you , this was after business hours and lunch express was closed .
my boyfriend has been a paying customer for _num_ freaking years .
this is unacceptable and disgusting behavior .
nobody was going to be going to his establishment anyways .
i was only planning on being there for about _num_ minutes .
i 've acted like an asshole before .
this man is not a good doctor .
he will not consider changing your meds .
however i was there last weekend and something was seriously wrong .
i doubt i 'll find myself there again at any hour .
a month or so later , i went in again .
thursday night and this place was dead .
i was very unhappy with the service i received on january _num_ .
the bar only had about _num_ customers including my self and my two friends .
yesterday was especially bad .
the second i entered the door i was greeted by three associates .
i guess i should have just said that .
i do n't understand the reviews of the restaurant .
we complained to the servers repeatedly and to the management with no positive results .
management appears brain dead .
main meal of pork chops and sea bass were boring .
food sounds great but tastes quite bland .
very disappointing .
but whatever it is now it has definitely fallen off and definitely not good .
the food on the other hand was bad .
no counter offer .
avoid .
rip off !
a shopping cart was missing after going through the carwash .
how about `` i 'm sorry we do n't offer hand washing '' .
wo n't be back .
my car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny .
so , why only one star ?
if you decide to go here , hide yo money .
first off everyone knows you do n't dry off a car in direct sun .
lastly for my $ _num_ wash they did not dress my tires .
i got my car washed here on sunday at around 2pm .
this place is not good .
i paid over _num_ bucks and got a really pathetic wash .
the inside job was laughable .
seems like they just took a dirty rag and quickly wiped down .
that 's like a server counting a tip while standing at your table .
rude .
terrible , the car was left scratches on the interior of my car .
it is rundown and needs updates .
talked to the owner but that went no where .
go elsewhere for a car wash .
i wo n't be tipping on this service any longer .
they did n't dry my front or back bumper .
i was yelled at by the extremely rude person running the car wash !
needed a fast wash so stopped in .
beyond that the cloth washer is filthy and dryer does n't work very well .
the manager refused to change the price saying that all the locals know this .
instead of being reputable they told me to pick another package .
i did and got a terrible job .
there are more reputable car washes close .
this place is just plain nasty .
nope , bad idea .
called them and they simply told me that i ordered wrong .
this place is not that great .
the chicken is what really bothered me here .
it was really tough and extremely chewy .
the sauce in the katsu was kinda of bland .
i was hungry so i ate it .
what was i thinking ?
is n't this supposed to be `` fast food '' ?
the reviews are wrong . ''
description did not include that shrimp was part of the soup .
no happy belly on this trip .
also , the restaurant is not that clean .
not even for the price was it good food .
this place sucks .
either way , horrible quality frozen meat .
even worse ?
i 'm definitely not bothering to come back here .
not when there 's a nellos and a great falafel place so nearby .
i wish i had gone to the pita house instead .
they are wrong .
it 's just so bad .
that ridiculous bread ?
i do not get it on any level .
i just do n't .
i should probably prepare you .
i was starving , and driving by one day , and needed a bite .
i did n't have an iphone .
the tomato was mushy .
the lettuce was limp .
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
methinks not . ''
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .
qt and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper .
oh , and your food is overpriced for what it is .
the owner would n't let me use the bathroom !
i took papa to that appointment and was present in the exam room .
then he walked out .
flash forward to september , _num_ , more than three years later .
insurance last billed on may _num_ , _num_ . ''
you have 4-5 nurses in the office who do nothing .
they never call and say they are running late .
why do they just assume their time is more valuable than mine .
he literally got annoyed when i asked him a question .
fill out their necessary paperwork and see that the place is relatively empty .
wrong .
i was scheduled for a test at a later date .
at the second appointment i was seen at close to my appointment time .
he got up walked out of the room .
and that does not make much of a standard to meet .
`` why not complain to management '' you say ?
but somehow , the partying continued - as did our lack of sleep .
absolutely ridiculous .
i could n't sleep during the week due to the loud noise .
i was really disappointed .
what does that have to do with me , im not the carpet cleaners ?
you should 've taken a picture .
avoid like the plague !
the place is horrible .
no shit its loud and dirty .
your car is going to get towed .
worst experience i have ever had renting !
of course i am not going to live there again after that experience !
they could not be a more unethical business practice .
-they do not care about their tenants .
shower , sinks , everything .
avoid at all costs .
ps , god save you if you try to play music at the pool .
my car was towed from my parking spot , etc .
luckily our lease ended the following week but we got the hell out asap .
we signed a _num_ month lease and the first few months were pure bliss .
its old , dirty and you will never get your security deposit back .
but worst of all is their illegal leasing practices .
seriously stay away from this money trap .
totally not impressed with this place .
oh , and parking sucks .
it 's ridiculous !
really the only good thing about this place is the location .
one star is honestly a stretch for this place .
since the first day i 've moved in here there has been endless problems .
is there an option for _num_ stars ?
one might think there would be not much more to say .
it 's better spent elsewhere in scottsdale .
horrible customer service .
come on ... it prob cost them _num_ cents .
does yelp give kick backs for good ratings ?
nothing new , just wasted time .
she said that coach does give boxes or sells boxes .
even with my receipt she had no interest in helping me out .
quite disappointed with my experience here .
and this second go around is horrible !
and management does n't do anything about it .
the tree branch was broken for about a week .
in the `` upgraded '' apartment there is a washer and dryer in unit .
do n't even think about moving here .
this place blows and i absolutely hated living here .
the units are outdated , dark , and depressing .
kitchen appliances were terrible , carpet was cheap and uncomfortable .
the worst .
if you live here , you only get one assigned covered parking space .
mind you , there are only about _num_ `` free '' parking spaces .
so , if you have a roommate , you guys are screwed .
$ _num_ , what a scam !
the only reason to live here is because it 's somewhat cheap .
dumb .
no air conditioning , no tv or radio , no water fountain .
at about _num_ minutes before the office opened .
i barely lived in this apartment .
i do n't smoke and did n't stain anything .
i 'm just glad to be done with them .
once they get you in the door , they forget about you .
they literally thought i was someone else and did n't remember me at all .
embarrassing for me , then .
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .
our inconsiderate neighbors below us would chain smoke constantly on their patio .
the front office did n't care .
they did n't think that was funny .
with the prices now , i would n't give it a second glance .
both management companies act like they care but do n't really .
during my lease i went out of town for a total of _num_ weeks .
i urge everyone go to anywhere else !
the area is decent but the complex itself is pretty bad .
avoid at all costs .
it really makes the entire experience go downhill .
the ladies would not even acknowledge my presence in the store .
i went in to buy a birthday gift and they lost a sale .
it 's pf changs .
it 's generic americanized asian food .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
eight hours after i ate my take-out from p.f .
overall just a bad experience .
a hole in the wall chinese restaurant can produce better chinese food .
the food here was not good .
we ordered several dishes including the dumplings , seafood , and noodles .
absolute waste of time and money .
taste is average and not worth the cost .
ie no value for money .
not gon na visit this one again .
go to pei wei and have the same food for less money .
do n't pay for it .
pei wei is just as awful for less .
i noticed the new dim sum on the menu .
we ordered some dumpling and they were absolutely disgusting .
tasted like the kind you could buy from costco .
that too was salty .
anyway , one thing to ring home about was the lettuce wraps app .
way to go on killing me .
when the correct food came it was just ok.
terrible !
my food was not hot at all so i had to send it back .
the manager did n't have any idea why the kitchen was being so slow .
i dropped $ _num_ on food that was not all that good.
they became soggy ) but why so much sugar !
totally not worth the cost of the food.
i was so excited because i was totally craving rice noodles .
i get settled in and ready to dish up my entree .
same thing .
not a long noodle in the entire order !
the chef must have been off last night .
the quality was horrible .
not priceless .
insulting .
pf chang 's just ca n't get it right .
it took me a month to get back here .
they remembered my order , as all aloha systems do regarding takeout orders .
upon arrival , i choose to inspect my order .
i told them i had a bad experience last time .
you will find no personal service from this location .
and if so , why is mr .
we recently chose this restaurant to celebrate a birthday .
there was a choice of soup or salad .
the soup was ordered by three others , and it was egg drop soup .
egg drop soup is not rocket science .
the soup was so bad nobody would eat it .
it tasted like nothing .
it was almost empty .
absolutely horrible .
picked up a to-go order for my husbands birthday ; what a disappointment .
she is visiting from another state .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
i had a larger order catered for my company , nothing too big .
this is where things turned into an absolute nightmare .
the white rice was overcooked and chewy .
we ordered the carnitas tacos appetizer which is _num_ tacos .
well , there were _num_ of us .
she mentioned we could get _num_ tacos .
i do n't know why it was such a miss for them tonight .
_num_ p.m. arrival .
zero crowd .
nearly empty dining room .
maybe the kitchen was n't used to the slow demand .
this restaurant lets pet dogs inside .
it 's disgusting .
the food is n't clean .
they do n't care about customers with allergies .
nothing was comped .
my hair at that time was cut pretty decent .
unfortunately i still hate it _num_ months later .
big mistake !
this i will say , i like the vibe of the salon itself .
i did n't view that this visit .
my friend was obviously horrified and left the store immediately .
it 's too bad you can rate a store zero stars .
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
i left after that with nothing .
i immediately said no and opened my purse to show them .
i waited at the counter for _num_ minutes before i asked for help .
i had already picked out the glasses i wanted to try on .
not a word out of her .
i walked over and signed for my purchase .
the receipt was put on the counter and the associate walked away .
they have everything but no good sales going on when i was there .
plenty of associates around some friendly some well not so friendly .
someone i know went into this store to buy a purse .
( i hate name calling , but this was beyond reasonable . )
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
the lack of customer service is horrendous !
very disappointing and happens almost all the time .
unfortunately , the experience was not what i expected .
it was truly the worst manicure and pedicure i 've ever had .
buyer beware , its not what you think it is .
i got extensions by ashley wright and i have had nothing but problems since .
do n't waste your money !
not too happy with haircut , i felt like she didnt listen to me .
my overall experience was mediocre .
it really was as basic as you can get .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
very disappointed , should have read the reviews first !
after i had chosen from the extremely limited color selection , my pedicure started .
but the manicure was even worse !
based on my experience , i do not recommend this salon !
i wish i could give this _num_ stars .
no thanks , there 's too much competition to lack in service like this .
i was extremely disappointed in this salon .
at this point the manicure was looking to take another hour .
my nails looked worse than when i walked in .
beware , stay away , keep your money and go elsewhere .
no wonder they have so many bad reviews here !
wished i had read yelp before going there myself !
when you get past the quantity you realize that the food is pretty bland .
so here 's the deal on the service .
everything we ordered was terribly slow to come .
other than taking and delivering our order , he did nothing for us .
while not rude , he was not pleasant or overly friendly either .
even for family style plates , i think it 's slightly overpriced .
when they say a small serves 2-3 , that 's 2-3 lunch sized portions .
if you 're a `` healthy '' eater , count on _num_ .
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
small spaghetti with marinara , normally $ _num_ but free .
marinara was okay , nothing special .
tasty but overpriced at $ _num_ for two breasts imo .
remember it does not come with any pasta , just the chicken .
might come back , might not .
dinner portions are only for _num_ or _num_ people .
there is no single serving size for dinner !
hit or miss .
but i wo n't take my chances .
avoid the fat grumpy mean looking woman server with the broad face .
over the years , the quality went down .
i was incredibly disappointed .
i will not be returning .
then i spoke up and said there was and that i had tasted it .
she responded that she would go check on that .
some was really good , some was really bad .
for dessert there was cheese cake and chocolate cake .
the cheese cake had no crust but was decent .
it was just terrible !
for the entree we chose lobster spaghetti , chicken carbonara and baked ziti .
the carbonara was the bomb !
sorry guys , you need to get your wait staff in check .
drinks , way over priced .
$ _num_ for a tall glass of draft beer .
manager made it very uncomfortable .
this place is gross .
terrible manager ( how he has a job , i do not know .
came here with a large party .
some people 's food was forgotten .
the bills were all wrong .
i just could n't eat the stuff it was so bad .
the host staff should have been helping in other areas .
this place is awful , the food is also awful .
definately , i will no go back .
i wish yelp would have a spot for no stars .
ate there with a group of _num_ .
food is expensive for the lack of quality .
very unhappy .
and almost _num_ bucks for ice tea ?
very very disappointed and irritated .
my wife and i came in with very low expectations .
first , we ordered a calamari appetizer and a bottle of wine .
the problem started when our food was delivered before the wine .
i mean , we finished the calamari and no sign of the wine .
it was a spicy pasta with chicken .
unfortunately , the sauce tasted like sea food .
it was truly bad !
do n't waste your money !
the worst service ever !
just one degree below the food- which was horrible .
with reservation , arriving on time , we waited _num_ min to be seated .
somehow it was cold when it got to us .
and bland .
no i mean very bland .
only _num_ tables seated , we ordered a pasta dish and a pizza .
asked for the manager and he could n't have been more rude or condescending .
but when it came down to sitting down , there was no booth .
ten minutes later , a couple is seated there .
our waitress hardly checked on us .
water was always empty .
her personality was the same as cardboard .
service and seating was terrible at this location .
at this location the service was terrible .
not to mention she was very rude and short with us .
( this happened twice ) .
overall it was a poor experience with bad service and average food .
ridiculous .
_num_ ) we tried to cash out , and the bartender had disappeared .
very disappointing .
went there with a large group and ordered the chicken parmesan and minestrone soup .
the soup was the worst i have ever had in my life .
( no exaggeration ) .
i mentioned it to the server and she shrugged it off .
they clearly do n't care about customer service because my complaint was ignored .
avoid !
she was knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in the ordering process .
the veal parmesan was tough , chewy , almost rubbery - and expensive .
standard salad and cheese bread were fine .
and , the restaurant is showing quite a bit of wear and tear .
overall a big disappointment .
we are n't very excited about coming back .
came here on a saturday night with _num_ coworkers on a work trip .
that 's completely unacceptable .
nothing to write home about or return for .
they also walk you through the kitchen on the way to your table .
there was shit everywhere and it was filthy to say the least .
did not tell me it would be $ _num_ for extra sauce .
plus lets not forget the $ _num_ for one meatball .
so now were up to almost $ _num_ for a small spaghetti .
then we had a dish that was a assortment of _num_ stuffed pastas .
wish they could have separated them some how .
so the bill was $ _num_ for two small pastas and one meatball .
super disappointed .
but were not in italy and expect more sauce on our food .
feel ripped off for the last _num_ and only orders .
i had heard so many good things , but wow was i wrong .
when i first walked in it has a weird setup .
that is a bit odd but nothing that would make me dislike it .
the people there were nice accept my waitress .
the food was cold with no flavor .
this was a waste of time and money and gets two thumbs down .
literally _num_ min .
( _num_ ) dish out of a party of _num_ .
i doubt this location will be here in _num_ years .
this place is horribly managed .
i will not wait an hour for average italian food !
biggest scam in town .
service was lacking and had to wait another _num_ mins to get our drinks .
the server was horrible .
she simply stood there and asked if we were ready yet .
no suggestions , even when asked .
i just gave up .
i will not be going back and will tell my friends not to bother .
i 've never been so disrespected by staff and management as i have here .
bad service , food was cold , and very expensive .
no bread for _num_ minutes and was cold .
charged for entree not ordered ( $ _num_ ) .
ordered linguini with seafood , was cold to the touch .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
complained to manger , he did nothing except correct the check .
however , after mother 's day i 'm never coming here again .
what a ripoff for an app , chicken and a bowl of pasta .
also they had ran out of basil which was a bummer .
next , the service was severely lacking .
we had empty glasses for over _num_ minutes .
there are dozens of better places in old town and scottsdale in general .
going to avoid this place from now on .
i did not notice it in the beginning because of the sauce .
spicy chicken rigatoni was not spicy @ all , sauce watery and tasteless .
had a $ _num_ off coupon on phone .
server returned to say coupon not accepted in computer .
food was disappointing and so was the service .
tasted like a honey glaze and was disgusting .
she realized before we sat down that we wanted privacy .
not a chance , not even for free cake .
just a glass of wine and an antipasto salad .
side order of cheesy garlic bread .
the salad was nothing to brag about .
dr. marks and his staff are extremely rude !
the doctor was horribly wrong , as the bill was slightly under $ _num_ .
i would not recommend him for your use as a general practice do .
i called and said this is not me ... they said oops !
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
what kind of sports bar does n't serve sliders ?
no !
had to wait _num_ minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us .
okay those people left it 's just me and my friend now -- crap !
i 'm too young to shut this place down !
this place is horrible .
the bathrooms are from _num_ and have not been cleaned since _num_ .
the manager is rude .
the staff is horrible .
there are so many better options just a stones throw away .
can not find a worse place to eat within _num_ miles .
forgettable food , drink , and atmosphere .
unfortunately , our viewing time was cut short by a pushy waitress .
sadly , the food was forgettable and service was poor .
not the best of dining experiences .
not the best sports bar but nice patio .
tvs too small for the size of the place .
avoid sunday football , not well set up for breakfast or coffee .
the owners should probably train their wait staff to be proper .
only gave them one star because i had to .
when i complained , i was called rude !
not gluten free friendly on game day .
was ignored by numerous staff .
poor service around .
would n't return here before a game .
i 've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had .
i recommend driving down the street to tandoori times instead .
each time i was disappointed .
seriously , i want it hot .
like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato .
the rice and _num_ were fine .
after the visit tonight we will never be back .
taste of food - it was really bad .
the naan wasnt like a naan at all but more like tandoori roti .
my point in writing this is really to inform the owners .
but unless they do that , we are not going back again .
no credit courtesy at all .
never going back .
waste of money .
mediocre and extremely overpriced indian food .
$ _num_ per tiny samosa ?
the kicker is not only is it overpriced , it 's not even good .
not terrible , but not good either .
will not be back ever again .
we should have complained and left but we ate it and forever regret it .
three of us with a groupon certificate for $ _num_ visited your restaurant .
_num_ ) apology in words means very little .
the cauliflower was actually cold to the touch .
not impressed .
wo n't be back .
horrible service , good food though .
looks the waiters just dont want to work !
i 've had good indian food , so maybe i 'm biased .
the naan was bland , and a little soggy .
had dinner there tonight .
the service was terrible .
after being seated it took _num_ minutes to get a waiter .
_num_ minutes to get a drink and then _num_ min .
to get our food and then _num_ min .
wo n't be going back .
terrible service .
however we still did n't have our check .
she does n't belong in the service industry !
all she could do was apologize repeatedly .
i do n't want an apology just attentive professional service .
please do n't miss the fact that the food was great .
just avoid the restaurant.com and avoid this place .
water tastes dirty ice tea was terrible .
the person on the phone repeated the order and everything was ok .
i would skip this one .
my insurance fully covers all routine visits ( cleaning , basic x-rays ) .
i went in for a routine visit and then get a bill .
i should n't have paid the bill .
i go in for a cleaning and then get a bill .
i can not trust any professional who is not upfront with you about costs .
this has not been an enjoyable customer service experience so far .
every phone call i made was picked up by voicemail .
i left detailed messages and never received a return call .
i also left messages on the contact section of their website to no avail .
worst mani/pedi i have ever had !
waste of money , even for a groupon .
wish i would have .
they are uneven , and actually painful .
you could not pay me to go back !
terrible .
this is the first negative review i have written .
basically a free manicure , how bad can it be ?
i walked in and the woman was already dealing with another client .
she assured me it would be no more than _num_ min .
do not get a filling from this guy .
the food is not good .
granted it was a saturday night .
my most recent visit , a thursday , left a lot to be desired .
we all left thinking that we should have gone somewhere else .
this is a bitter review .
awful and not happy .
big mistake .
do yourself a favor and do not visit this place .
seriously the worst and most over priced nail salon i have ever been to .
whatever , no big deal .
but it looked nothing like the flower on my fingers .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
no customer service skills and serious lack of talent .
if i could leave _num_ stars i would .
such a waste of money .
the quality of mani / pedi just was n't there for me .
omg .
one of the worst nail salons i have ever been to .
i got the response `` i know '' in an extremely rude tone .
she did not apologize or anything .
secondly , the customer service over all was horrible .
no one was friendly at all .
lastly , my nails look horrible !
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
actually does n't even deserve one star .
anyway , please please do n't waste your time nor money here .
do n't go to this salon .
this place was a waste of time and money .
my pedicure was mediocre at best .
she was not meticulous in getting polish on the entire nail .
i will definitely not be back .
i will never waste my money going back there .
waste of $ _num_ !
this should be a zero star review .
did no massage , says it 's only for deluxe pedicure .
she was done in about _num_ minutes .
horrible !
so rude , i was about to walk out .
worst place ever to get your nails done in scottsdale .
the gel polish is uneven and overall the pedicure looks sloppy .
it was awful .
no , no , no do n't go .
i would not have tipped generously .
okay atmosphere , it smells really bad inside .
he did nothing about it and just out a clear coat on top .
it really hurt .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars .
the man also did a very sloppy job .
as he painted them he bumped on and never fixed it .
if you are looking at going here i suggest not !
i will not be go back to this place any time soon .
i also do n't agree with the cash or check only form of payment .
but do n't expect something worthwhile .
the place was clean and the staff was friendly .
i called and made an appointment for _num_ people for a pedicure and manicure .
i went first and my friend sat next to me and waited .
my friend had no waited _num_ minutes for her pedicure .
avoid this awful nail salon !
do n't go here for any reason .
at the end her nails looked awful .
avoid this awful nail salon !
do n't go here for any reason .
at the end her nails looked awful .
you 're wasting a lot time and money if you come here period !
when she was done they told me it would be _num_ dollars .
disgusting and foul .
i will not be coming back .
today i was excited to get my free gel pedicure .
um , excuse me ?
i call bs , and poor business practices .
the card clearly said free gel pedicure , which is a $ _num_ value .
now they have lost a customer to save themselves $ _num_ .
absolutely ridiculous .
this place has gone down hill , quickly .
the last _num_ visits have been horrific .
but seriously i left bleeding the last time .
this place is horrible and i will never recommended them or use then again .
they did n't even try to make it right .
horrible job on nails and toes .
horrible work .
gel on top is not cleaned up if it gets on skin or cuticles .
no attention to detail .
i would not suggest that anyone ever tries this place out .
the only person in this whole place who was friendly was the receptionist .
i went back to the courts for another referral this place was so bad .
i explained this was impossible and that i had attended ever single one .
in the past , maintenance response has been quite quick .
as a result , i would not recommend this apartment to anyone .
random employees coming and going , no consistency .
maintenance issue response times at least doubled .
so add false advertising to the list .
very glad to be out .
his only response was `` i 'm sorry . ''
i have the most awful upstairs neighbors .
do they get a warning for noise ?
the last thing that kills me about this place is how overpriced it is .
i pay over _num_ dollars every month for a tiny one bedroom apartment .
this is by far the worst rental company i 've had to deal with .
the staff are horrible .
their customer service skills are worse than mcdonalds employees .
maintenance is required monthly .
a/c goes out during the summer at least once a week .
hot water was shut off for days at a time .
do not sign a lease with these people .
anything she tells you is a lie .
i would rather live in a box on the street than live here .
there are enough cockroaches for a horror film .
the front office lied about moving out fees and sent me to collections .
apt life kind of sucks anyway .
here it 's like hell .
i am so thankful to be out of this place .
they put in new laundry units and half of them did not work .
some of the residents are questionable .
no wonder we had so many roaches .
only adding a star because i have to .
i gave a _num_ day notice and was still sent to collections .
upgrading the pool and laundry ?
nasty apartments .
cockroaches and super old and gross .
only thing good is the location .
im only leaving _num_ star because i have to .
they are the worst management company i have even dealt with .
the management has no authority .
they are rude and dont ever do what they say they will .
they are totally disorganized and only care about the new ac unit .
our air has n't been working for the past few weeks .
pizza , pasta and salad ... boo .
i 'd recommend avoiding this and going across the road to pizza re .
since it was a first time order , i gave them a break .
the crust is not new york style , it 's just regular hand tossed .
and again a cold piece of carmel crunch cake .
this place sucks .
do n't waste your money .
ordered a large cheese pie thin crust and a large new york style crust .
just terrible is all i can say .
no taste no flavor a basic chain style pie with no soul .
i was torn between a _num_ and a _num_ on this review .
we ordered two pizzas , a salad , and soda at 6:00 .
when they arrived _num_ minutes later , both pizzas were soggy and inedible .
we have had mediocre luck with the rest .
this was a $ _num_ .
order - which we threw in the trash because it was inedible .
i am looking for recommendations of decent pizza delivery in south scottsdale .
pizza is a little below average , i think .
it was not bad food .
but it was not great food either .
the spaghetti bolognese was meh !
the crust was extremely hard and the pizza wasnt hot at all .
that 's not what i received .
i could only have a few bits before i throw my slices away .
very poor customer service .
incredibly long wait times .
avoid scottsdale healthcare .
this is the new normal under scottsdale healthcare .
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
been there done that .
the beer i had was icy cold .
the band was not so great i think they were rock lobster .
there was no wait service except at the bar .
which sucked also .
because believe me it was n't worth it .
the patio scene was even lame .
$ _num_ cover .
maybe next time people should n't stare at us as much ?
first , they charged me more than i signed for .
it would have been nice to know that .
and try and talk to the door man .
sort of an older crowd when i was there .
no good looking women .
cheesy band playing .
bartender was a rude bitch .
and maybe that 's not even a far stretch .
but this was not the venue for them .
oh and the drinks are expensive too .
will never go back to the place again .
yes , i 'm dumb on how i spend my money .
yes , i do n't care if i pick up a pig .
the only reason i was back was for a concert .
the people at the door had the worst attitudes i have ever come across .
i had one beer and was kicked out for being `` drunk '' .
i was n't even buzzed .
this is after i paid $ _num_ to see a band .
i will never go back to this place again .
sorry gang would give this place no star if i could .
i know where to find it -- this place !
drinks are overpriced and the door staff is a bit much .
ummm ... not so much .
wish i could give _num_ stars .
save your time , save your money .
this place is so not worth it , go somewhere else .
i could n't leave fast enough .
this dump does not deserve your business !
not so much .
weird , but whatever .
seriously , nicest bartender i 've experienced in downtown scottsdale .
i admit , the patio looked nice and the cushions were comfortable .
what a waste of time and money .
do n't waste your time and money .
love the venue , the staff could use some help .
of course , no one reviewed the sushi yet .
maybe it was an off night , i just would n't recommend it .
i would have been better going off to ra .
i lost it .
well i had already made my trip there from the air port .
the dim sum items were over steamed and were dried out on top .
even the eggrolls were horrible .
not only is the food horrible , it 's dirty and service sucks .
gross .
you will never see me back here again .
this might be a harsh review but i gave them _num_ chances .
the sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable .
i ordered a thai noodle dish with tofu and my bf ordered pad thai .
i threw out my meal and ate popcorn for dinner .
so i went across this place on yelp .
with all the good reviews me and my bf decide to try it out .
the hot tea was like plain hot water .
so so disappointed .
how does this place get such good reviews i do n't get it ?
so many people seem to rave about it .
i gave the hostess my order and waited at the bar .
there was no service at the bar save for some water .
the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
it looked like egg drop soup that i could have made in my sleep .
i do n't understand all of the great reviews of this place .
the food here is pretty blah .
everything tastes ok , but just really off .
the last time was so disappointing .
i was second hand embarrassed for this restaurant .
so rude .
and annoying .
i went here tonight with the bf .
so the bf and i sit there .
the other table gets their beers and sushi ... still nothing !
and the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point .
the service was that bad .
not cool .
the dish was terrible .
the entire ordeal lasted one and half hours ... for just entrees and water .
overall , the experience was terrible .
it was unacceptable .
i mean $ _num_ dollars for pretty okay egg rolls ?
i got a _num_ and my friend a _num_ .
both dishes were so hot and spicy , we could n't eat !
she did seem a bit too `` happy '' .
do not purchase the beef and zucchini or shrimp panang .
both are not worth feeding to a rat .
the crab rolls as an appetizer should just be thrown in the trash ... .
the deco and atmosphere is nice but food is terrible .
but what a disappointment .
it was plain , rough and tasteless .
their sweet and sour soup was dark , watery and tasted awful .
my wife said only fried rice was ok .
i will not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
for the entree , i had the shrimp in lobster sauce .
chang and pei wei ) , you can often get away with that .
the edamame was greasy and did n't seem fresh at all .
oh no , no , no !
no beef !
neither of us ate it .
gross !
i will not be back unless my meal is free .
the staff was somewhat obnoxious .
i would 've gotten a drink but after hearing that , why bother .
the menu was overwhelming .
they lack taste and still does n't compare to my mother 's thai recipe .
a few months ago i went to this place at lunchtime .
there were about five tables taken and plenty of empty tables available .
the sweet and sour chicken was bright pink and more onion than anything else .
overall somehow the dish was bland .
the rice that came with it was soggy - too much water .
the flavor was n't bad , but overcooked noodles really ruins a noodle dish .
the fish , like so many of us , had just given up .
but both were mediocre .
the only thing that was good was the jasmine tea .
they just need to be trained better .
i guess that was true because i gave in and ordered it a _num_ .
the pho is super bland !
i was very disappointed with this place .
the egg drop soup smelled like a wet dog and looked pretty gross too .
i could n't even bring myself to try it .
the egg rolls were ok , they could have been more crunchy .
there are way better places around for thai or asian food .
ca n't believe they call this pho .
it 's not .
they did n't put them in our bag .
$ _num_ later and i 'm still craving pho .
not impressed .
i went here because my favorite pho soup restaurant was closed .
it was a major turn off .
it tastes horrible , stay away .
no notes of garlic , ginger , or deep soy flavor .
the noodles were also way too thin !
the sauce for the steamed dumplings was way off .
i know i 'm being hard on this place .
maybe , but this ran me nearly _num_ $ .
the hype is not real .
i really do n't like writing negative reviews .
almost tasteless .
what she was served was overcooked chicken in an overly sweet sauce .
i 've tried this place twice now and i 'm not impressed .
too bad because it 's so close to where we live .
wo n't be back .
seriously disappointing .
we got mongolian beef , sesame chicken and beef chow mein .
the chow mein was not even chow mein by any definition !
on top of that the beef in it was extremely dry and flavorless .
i came here to grab lunch based on the reviews and was disappointed !
i also ordered tom yum soup and the flavor was totally off .
it was dark , heavy and was salty .
it did not taste like any other thai tom yum soup .
, and crispy chicken with thai basil .
my friend ordered chicken with cashew .
could barely taste or see the basil .
the plate is full with unnecessary crispy noodle .
not completely convinced i will come back .
i hate the hub .
it is just obnoxious .
it so `` i hate my life !
gag .
just crappy customer service .
its seriously pathetic .
its the worst customer service .
however , the online part of staples is great !
when i pointed out his mistake , he still did n't believe me .
drove to staples to pick up some office supplies for my son .
no easy button for you ... staples !
horrible experience today .
two papers printed i was only given one .
overall rude and unwelcoming .
had several customers walk out due to the wait , very rude costumer service .
terrible .
it seems every time i come to this location i have a negative experience .
i was beginning to think that someone else had picked it up .
the guy in the print center is nearly useless and his tone is rude .
this guy does n't have basic computer knowledge .
i will not be back to this location !
this new and improved dunkin donuts is the worst .
unfortunately , they were out of eggs !
are you kidding me ?
i took a sip and it was pretty gross - way too much syrup !
the donuts are underwhelming .
i 've had supermarket bakery donuts that are much better and cheaper .
she grabbed them from me and said she would make them over .
after making them she pretty much threw them at me and walked away .
she said she was n't and then just walked away again .
first the cream gun was broken , fine .
keep in mind i only want the one kind of donut .
i go get them elsewhere both times after disappointed .
no more !
she did n't see it that way and thought it better i left .
wow , ridiculous .
not all the new people up to speed .
the doughnuts were great , but my coffee was n't .
tasted watered down , no flavor and just tasted like straight sugar .
waited _num_ minutes for a starter wrap .
no `` sorry for the wait '' .
no hand washing or food service gloves .
waited _num_ minutes for a starter wrap .
no `` sorry for the wait '' .
no hand washing or food service gloves .
worst service ever .
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
the girls were nice but the product was still crap .
someone needs to train their answering service how to speak to potential clients .
rude !
his respond was `` again , i can not tell you anything '' .
certainly will not be going here !
$ _num_ a skirt for a grand total of $ _num_ .
if i needed it done over night i would probably pay that price .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
not impressed .
never once did anyone apologize for being late .
i will never go there again and i suggest you do n't either .
i mean , can i have some food on my sandwich ?
the second time was almost $ _num_ for slightly more .
they have lost everything that previously made them better than subway .
not my fave place .
paste that has been sitting in a bucket for _num_ days .
i requested jalapeos and banana peppers and i swear i got one of each .
i 'm starving but not enough to even finish this sandwich .
she was always rude .
the people making the sandwiches were inept .
she & her staff should never be allowed to serve the public again !
nothing here to get excited about .
the service was atrocious .
this place is horrible !
and whatever you do , do n't forget to close your tab !
wtf !
the place was down right creepy .
do n't get me wrong , i love me a dive bar .
i hated this place .
total waste of a great place .
had a really bad customer service experience there .
our meals , however , were very lame .
we were not inspired enough to go back .
not a place for foodies .
i would recommend trying something else in the valley before trying here .
ordered the carne adovada ... bland , dry , and boring .
no spice , no flavor , and runny as all get out .
so the last couple times i 've been to carlsbad i 've been disappointed .
this place has really lost its luster .
it came out so spicy that she could n't even eat it .
the restaurant in general was not very clean .
all in all , mediocre and over-priced .
the black beans were inedible and the rice was microwaved and obviously quite old .
$ _num_ with tip and one beer .
i was in scottsdale for work and was craving something from the southwest .
the bartender , i think his name was louie , was very friendly .
this is not new mexican food .
i wo n't go back .
the food just was n't up to par .
more of a tex-mex than authentic mexican food .
rice was very dry .
green chile sauce overpowered taste of chicken and shrimp .
husband had the pork burrito with red sauce .
also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting .
very bland .
i was excited to check this place out .
kitschy decor , annoying tvs , service was ok but disinterested .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
lots of bland , greasy cheese and no fresh herbs or fresh flavors .
the cheese crisp was flavorless and unappetizing .
the pork was dry and flavorless .
i decided it was time to give it another try .
then i realized why i had n't been back in _num_ years .
bland food , bland food , and bland food .
will probably be at least another _num_ years .
no more !
she does n't understand why we are not happy with everything on the side .
the dessert on the other hand was a nightmare .
not impressed .
things went downhill from there .
at that point we left and will not be back .
great waiter too !
unfortunately , the burger i received was cooked to medium .
anyway , i 'm just not sure i want to return .
this has to be the worst tex-mex i 've ever had .
disappointing .
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
i do n't know why it has such high ratings .
first of all our waiter was terrible and the food was so so .
he then brought me a sangria which was all ice .
i would not recommend this place .
this was the worst new mexican food and margaritas we ever had !
it tasted more like it was smothered in bbq sauce .
the only reason i gave it _num_ star is for the cool atmosphere !
i have no idea how this place has _num_ stars on here .
if the ambience isnt enough to kill your appetite , the food sure is .
we absolutely love the food but the management is rude .
there were no reserved signs on the tables .
if i had n't of waited so long i would have sent it back .
the service is atrocious .
it 's just insane .
there are _num_ or _num_ salads and that 's about it .
overall , we are disappointed with the service .
however the food left a lot to be desired .
nothing special .
plus i hate places that do n't offer chips and salsa for free .
wo n't be back .
how wrong i was .
while the server was very nice in getting this done the burrito was horrible !
the rice was crunchy and did not taste like regular spanish rice .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
this place is ridiculous .
it 's dreadful and just pathetic .
really just a waste of time .
the bartender did n't seem to care at all .
this lady even spoke about how she was drinking and driving home .
anyways , food was mediocre as well .
nachos were just chicken , cheese , and meat .
no green onion , no tomato , no guac .
ordered the nachos and the veggie enchiladas , and _num_ margaritas .
lobster enchilada and they forgot the lobster .
all u could taste was corn tortilla , thick , and dry .
meatloaf was over cooked , green chile burger was flavorless .
the nachos and beer were the best part .
sorry to my family for wasting your money .
zero stars .
ugh .
just do n't go .
i will .
it was literally floating in grease .
totally disgusting .
i also asked for no beans and they threw them all over my plate .
what place in arizona does n't allow dogs on the patio ?
their bat brew was alright ... a bit sour .
my friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito ( broccoli ) .
like you could n't cut then with a knife .
literally no flavor .
also the $ _num_ guac was now $ _num_ on the bill .
the server was not attentive .
our water glasses were filled though because the busser was amazing .
my sister and i very disappointed .
not sure why not that many people there .
plus the worst cheese crisp ever !
the free chips & salsa when check in not that great at all .
he had the pork tenderloin and thought that it was bland .
( this is one of the items that did n't have peppers . )
strangely enough the salsa are too bland .
three of us came in on saturday october _num_ around _num_ .
the salsa was too spicy , the guacamole was good .
the other two plates were not edible due to the spiciness of the sauces .
even before we left the restaurant i felt sick to my stomach .
we can all tolerate spiciness , but what we had here was too much .
i will not be coming back .
the pork enchilada was soo dry i gave up & spit it out .
they were definitely light on the chili , and it was alright .
i really do not understand why the reviews are so good .
the food was very mediocre and it smelled like old beer in the restaurant .
i do not recommend this place .
this was not the case today .
i am not a fan of cold , soggy french fries .
i do n't eat burgers unless they are well done .
you will be disappointed .
a far cry from actual new mexico food .
chips and salsa not complimentary .
salsa is not hot or good .
ive tried this place twice .
terrible service .
unbelievably terrible and slow service .
food was n't terrible but not good either .
i really have nothing good to say , even the drinks were overpriced .
$ _num_ bad margaritas .
dont go here , trust me .
not as good as we were expecting .
bit of a disappointment .
so he finally got to eat more after _num_ minutes of cooling .
he kept telling me it tasted off .
when we arrived , we were promptly seated in the direct sun .
this place could be so great but the service is very poor .
unfortunately it took a turn for the worst and we will never come back .
the server was awful .
my educated guess was that he had been drinking .
waitress seemed bothered by us and checked us once our meals were finished .
very disappointing !
mediocre .
wo n't be going back .
the food is really greasy and lacks flavor .
it was so watered down .
i had been consistently coming here near weekly for a few years .
however , it just keeps getting worse .
the meals were once prepared neatly , now sloppy .
went here with some friends and was not impressed .
chicken was dry and nachos had no flavor .
salsa was not spicy and very watered down .
the food itself was overpriced and just okay .
wo n't be back .
it may be called carlsbad tavern because its bad .
it should be on the outside warning people not to go in .
i had to park down _num_ blocks .
how hard is it to make chicken wings ?
why only late night ?
overall , the food was greasy , mediocre and overpriced .
maybe next time i will just order take-out from this establishment instead .
i did not recognize more than _num_ face ( a younger guy server ) .
my boyfriend and i walked in to ask for dining for _num_ .
they have never refused to make it .
food came out & food was bland and so disappointing .
i tip over _num_ percent and am not super picky .
never going back .
i am so disappointed in how this has gone downhill .
went for lunch today with a party of _num_ .
the restaurant was not crowded at all .
the chicken inside of the quesadilla was cold and the soup was luke warm .
they brought the fresh soup and only _num_ had sour cream in it .
but there was not .
no offer to replace it .
the server never apologized and we were charged for every item on our bill .
i am sad to say i will never go back .
i would n't go here again .
you ca n't really put the blame on them , can you ?
we ordered the carne asada tacos which were very disappointing .
i must say , the blue corn tortilla enchiladas were not that bad .
so do n't give up hope , just yet .
unfortunately , the food just did n't measure up .
the enchiladas were not even rolled .
i would not recommend the carlsbad tavern restaurant .
i know , i know .
we chose a chicken quesadilla , chicken nachos , and shrimp tacos .
she replied no .
then i bit into the shrimp taco , and you guessed it .
if you have any allergies to anything , do n't go here .
food was nothing special .
everyone i went with did n't enjoy their meal .
the service was slow with refills and the restaurant was not busy .
would n't recommend going here .
i would n't come back again .
worst dining experience ever .
absolutely disgusting to find half of my burrito was filled with balls of fat .
not a chance .
other than that , it was n't even tasty .
the food was too spicy to enjoy .
the service was slow .
she was n't friendly .
it took awhile to get out drinks and food .
but we wo n't be coming back .
she did n't deserve that good of a tip .
food was uninspired .
while unique it was not something that i would try again .
not as great as we had hoped , heard and read .
not long after our food comes .
it does not look very pretty .
eggs were n't mixed in they were on the side .
ok so whatever it does n't look good .
what was presented was not at all what i was expecting or used to .
the waitress was kind enough to take our chilaquiles dishes off our bill .
i should 've known better than to eat out at a mexican food place .
i 'm always disappointed .
nobody cooks like moms .
there were _num_ other tables in there .
i would say in all that the restaurant had maybe _num_ tables tops .
the kitchen was really slow at getting our food out .
should have shown earlier b .
that does not make sense as this was not mentioned in the offer .
it 's not a matter or free food but principle .
first time ever my yelp offer was not honored .
disappointed !
i have been in scottsdale for _num_ years and passed this place countless times .
it was a thursday night and not too busy .
the meat was old and extremely dried out .
they also do n't use seasoning .
not only was it old but there was no flavor at all .
save yourself the grief and find another place to eat .
this was not a good experience .
the bloody mary 's were watered down .
the potato hash was badly burned .
one of our party had strictly mexican food with no problem .
most likely will not return .
do not go to this company .
they have terrible customer service , especially at the corporate level !
they sure know how to shit on their customers .
very bad experience !
bad return policy !
such a shame that reputable company like this does that .
if i would have been given chips i may have eaten it .
i have never been disappointed with the quality of my food .
i really do n't like this place .
the food is not good .
which isnt to say its the servers fault .
the coke tasted like they have moldy lines or something .
the service was terrible .
waitress : chicken caesar salad ?
friend : no , just a regular caesar salad .
without the caesar dressing it 's just a salad .
beverages were bad .
could i give this place no stars ?
did n't get it .
no , and no .
needless to say , i have never returned to a zipps and never will .
the service here is awful !
man , sucks for you .
i guess your loss is someone else 's gain .
this place is awful !
i wish i could give it no stars .
i had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week .
the customer service here is awful !
i only wish i could give zero stars !
that 's no big deal .
the issue just begins here though .
however , said knife did not land in said wing basket .
it landed about _num_ inches from my leg .
what a terrible , terrible experience .
i wo n't eat here ever again .
they also make homemade fries and onion rings which was a plus .
my last trip here was the worst by far .
when we asked her she said it was and just walked away .
overall that was the worst zipps experience i 've had .
watery bloody and slow service .
terrible management .
if you are gon na have a drink here you better drive home drunk .
if you leave your car there it gets towed .
`` do you want your check yet ? ''
i tipped about _num_ % but i was really pissed i did .
i was served the most disgusting salad once there .
_num_ degrees on the patio and four of their heat lamps do n't work .
apparently the owners are too cheap to fix them .
skip this place .
sports bar quality is was it is but this location is the worst !
the foods good but the servers are terrible .
liked checking out other locations too .
wo n't be back to any .
okay , so my chili came to the table and i was sadly disappointed .
this is my honest opinion because these all were can i say , awful !
it had a tuna taste and just not cooked here kinda vibe .
he is very rude .
no personality at all .
you could tell she just clearly did not want to be there .
but i have never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant .
he simply stated he would talk to her .
i have never felt so offended and appalled by how we were treated .
just very unprofessional .
her demeanor was awful and the whole transaction had me sick .
i will not be attending this zipps in the near future .
it was nasty to see .
it 's not sanitary !
my style .
our server was nice enough , said she 's worked here for _num_ years .
wow , zipps has the worst tacos i have ever eaten .
you get four tacos , seasoned beef or chicken .
the chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same .
i should have taken a picture .
there was no cheese , lettuce or anything else on the tacos .
but i did find large pieces of lettuce under the tacos in the basket .
_num_ hrs later still fighting low grade fever and stomach upset .
star _num_ : how were the portions relative to the cost ?
another area where i ca n't really complain .
stars _num_ and _num_ : how was the food ?
it 's here where things were just a little bit off .
all in all , not a great food experience .
no stars granted .
star _num_ : would you eat here every day if you could ?
even so , no star granted here .
there are simply better options around the city .
wish one could do _num_ .
do not go to this zipps on a saturday night .
if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
i checked my account and saw the _num_ on my card .
still waiting on the call back .
really hoping my bank will refund me my money .
terrible service !
horrible experience .
management needs to know about the poor service .
food sucked horrible overall !
regret coming here everytime .
i regret coming here because the customer service is terrible .
managers are n't any better .
ugh , annoying .
if i could give a half star i would .
the sandwich was n't the greatest either .
just wanted to hurry up and get out of here .
the restroom was disgusting too .
as this is being written i just ended my contact with them .
_num_ nearly identical stones .
it was mentioned to me so many times that i began to feel uncomfortable .
i lost out on a potential purchase in this next week .
and it will not be here .
_num_ stars for how they tried to talk down to me .
i had no choice but to bump this down to _num_ stars .
this is a _num_ star rating .
my double baked potato was fine and desserts were at best average .
don & charlie 's is none of this .
then again it is not strictly a steakhouse .
but we experienced none of that .
the main thing that made me round down to _num_ stars was the price .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
sent it back and she did n't even offer to bring another one .
a shame too because it 's so close to the house .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
it was so bad i would n't ever go back to find out .
_num_ visits to don & charlie 's and i can form an opinion finally .
on my _num_ visits , i 've had _num_ different servers .
i 'm sorry , i expect you to be nice to me .
stop giving me the cold shoulder .
i 'm not your enemy , in fact we have never met .
our reservation apparently happened just moments after the asu football team showed up .
it was by far the worst service i have experienced in a long time .
one of my kids fell asleep waiting for his mac and cheese .
and i could n't get a drink to save my life .
he was obviously embarrassed and apologetic .
however my meal on valentines day was sub-par especially for this restaurant .
we were wrong .
nobody standing in the lobby like normal and no wait .
she came back with it and warned that it was very hot .
it was a $ _num_ app that i wish i never ordered .
the double baked potato was dry and bland .
got to say i am pretty disappointed overall .
the food came and my $ _num_ steak was covered in something deep fried .
my waitress to her credit noticed it and the food was never set down .
i just do n't get it .
do n't think i will be coming back for a bit .
the service is pedestrian , the place is stuffy and the food just meh .
the server was kind to bring me _num_ salad dressing options .
my other half had the bbq ribs w/ coleslaw and mashed potatoes .
it is a typical upscale american restaurant .
the ribs were high quality but the sauce was not spicy .
american cuisine seems to be flavored primarily with salt , fat and sugar .
the service sucked again .
and the food was marginal at best .
this is not it any more .
i didnt think anything was great about the place .
i ca n't believe the great reviews this place gets .
nothing , including the cooking techniques , has been updated since then .
we asked numerous times for ketchup and she kept forgetting .
the biggest problem i had was that i ordered ribs .
they were so dry that i had to pour lots of sauce over them .
they were the worst ribs i have ever had !
i had the bbq ribs and my daughter had the prime rib .
i ca n't say the ribs were anything spectacular .
_num_ years ago , the baby back ribs were outstanding .
through the past _num_ years , they 've slipped each year .
i 've never paid so much to be so disappointed in my life .
after we showed up for our reservation we waited another _num_ minutes .
she would n't even look us in the eye .
my dad is really hard of hearing and asked her to repeat herself .
i 'm sorry - look around .
our dishes were constantly being taken away from us before we were even finished .
and paid about $ _num_ less .
so ... yay liver .
not a family .
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
it was awful .
there was no time to enjoy anything .
they chatted for a few minutes , and he left their table .
and also presented a $ _num_ d & c happy birthday email .
walked over there for dinner - it was , of course , ridiculously crowded .
problem # _num_ - the hostess was completely clueless and overwhelmed .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
throughout the course of our meal , i think four servers served us .
no clue who our actual server was .
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
it is the new asu head coach , you know . ''
too bad - was hoping for better .
salad was boring .
sorry we wo n't be back .
ok , this place is barely ok .
it needs a major overhaul , then there is the parking lot .
the waitresses look like old ladies barely able to get around .
all in all re do it change this _num_ 's look .
awful awful awful !
the food was awful - i can make a better steak at home .
i have gotten better service at a taco bell .
unacceptable .
so rude .
literally , we sat there with a cleared table for _num_ minutes .
we were totally disappointed with how the waitress treated us .
an hour wait at 8:30 on a monday night ?
sorry , i 'll pass .
the food here , in my experience , was below average .
we all found them to be extremely dry and not terribly delicious .
the other people in my party ordered the roast chicken .
sorry , the famous ribs were short on meat and overcooked .
the deli slaw was soaked in vinegar .
wrong thing to do .
_num_ minutes pass , no check came even though our table had been cleared .
maybe it was n't even the groupon .
the prime rib comes with horseradish - very weak and cut with butter .
was n't the best , but way better than the butter !
the barbeque chicken was ok .
i do n't think i 'm coming back to this one .
i was pretty pissed .
that was _num_ % of the period allowed by the groupon !
that is horrific customer service !
you are correct , many other people did not get confused like i did .
i got confused .
i lost out .
calling my review a rant is not good customer service .
worst ribs ever !
their burgers are $ _num_ and up and are not that great .
well sorry mom , not going to happen this time .
unfortunately for her time here she could n't answer our questions very well .
only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food .
ribs tough = these babies will never fall off the bone .
_num_ guys went for ribs all agreed .
too bad the ribs are what you come for .
with the hype surrounding it i had high expectations .
the bread it came with was n't that attractive .
_num_ minutes after ordering the waitress came back and said she lost our ticket .
the food was completely unimpressive , and bland .
then she brought over a basket of toasted thin sliced bagels and rye bread .
yuck ... we asked for just regular sourdough and they did n't have any .
so she brought a basket of french bread with cheese , on the house .
nice gesture but the bread was greasy and flavorless .
bland and boring .
none of us ate more than a bite .
no garnish .
mother in law got what looked like a giant hamburger patty .
totally dry and flavorless .
no onions , no peppers .
the ribs were ok , nothing spectacular .
the hamburger was as expected .
but the mac and cheese was aweful .
lots of dry cheese on top , my daughter would n't eat it .
everything was very expensive .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
i ca n't believe this place is in business .
the food was cold with no flavor .
everything was terrible -i read the above reviews and was surprised .
the room is loud and crowded .
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
big trouble with reservation .
people making reservation were not interested .
the waitress who has been there _num_ years got a $ _num_ tip .
i ordered the burger with fries and then noticed it was $ _num_ .
horrible experience .
the manager was not apologetic at all .
very disappointed .
food was not good at all .
ribs were terrible and tough as can be .
a++ for them .
the bread was sub-par as the bagel was crisp and overly salty .
the calamari was ok not the best and not memorable .
the gold brick dessert was pretty good , but the chocolate was very frozen .
they charge for everything , fries , toppings , everything is extra .
what a disappointment !
overall , the experience failed to meet expectations .
sadly , i 'm in no rush to go back .
i have been dragged here several times .
tasteless , dry yuk !
oh , i almost forgot , i had the clam chowder .
even worst was the texture - clams should be tender and not rubbery .
would definitely not recommend .
our waitress was anything but friendly and not very patient with us .
do n't waste your time and $ $ $ highly overrated !
my wife ordered the fried ( formerly broasted ) chicken .
the waitress we had seemed to be unfriendly and we felt rushed .
with tip we laid out right around $ _num_ and will not be returning .
thanks but no thanks .
even with a reservation , you have to wait _num_ minutes to get seated .
it was dry and overcooked .
last week , i had the ribs .
i was really disappointed by how tough the meat was .
it was almost too much work to get the meat off the bone .
not sure i 'll try it again .
went to don and charlie 's tonight for mother 's day .
not acceptable .
no interest in going back .
horrible customer service .
horrid service with below average food .
definitely disappointing food .
huge disappointment !
had not been back for _num_ years and now i know why !
the prime rib was tasteless and the ribs were tough and dry .
the draft beer was flat and we returned that .
we are extremely disappointed .
what an overpriced disappointment .
no vegetarian choices , so-so side dishes .
by this time i lost my appetite .
very bad customer service .
old and tired with food to match .
the server was not very good to say the least .
she was getting closer but still not rare let alone very rare .
i hate this place .
i do n't understand how this kind of treatment is still acceptable .
i went to d & c the other day for restaurant week .
the ribs were extremely tough and did not fall off the bone .
but i have no idea how they can call these the best rib 's .
the rib 's i buy from the supermarket tasted better .
very disappointed and really hated to give these guys a bad review .
very disappointing .
old place , old smells .
very annoying .
the reviews were _num_ out of _num_ .
i do n't get it .
terrible .
in my opinion , that ruins a small intimate show .
additionally , the service was slow .
this place is pretty gross .
not surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared .
i could n't believe the staff was allowing this to happen .
even worse !
shame on that owner for allowing this to happen .
fuck my ass , she was right .
she looked very busy .
but she just , uh ... it was really weird .
it was a staring contest .
the bartender came up to me and asked if she could get me anything .
when you walk in thus place you are instantly confused .
i finished my beer , asked for another round , and waited _num_ minutes .
did i get a teeth cracking cold brew ?
came here on a friday night and was pleased it was n't busy .
i 'm almost certain the woman serving us was completely wasted too .
ordered the french dip , chicken fingers and potato skins .
other waitresses brought our food - which seemed to take a really long time .
do not give them your credit or debit card !
he is not returning any of my calls .
two weeks before they where out of pizza dough at _num_ pm .
i was glad to see the volleyball courts where going in _num_ degrees .
i need to note , we visited on a thursday .
jerk : are you interested in starting to collect ?
so as you can see , they 're pretty pretentious and blatantly rude .
they will not allow you to view the art without a salesperson present .
yes , i was told the same thing as the reviewer below .
never in my life have i been treated so poorly in a sales environment .
they have no idea how many potential buyers they have turned away .
incredibly rude and impatient .
and not picture worthy , you jerk .
this was _num_ minutes before they closed and never got a call back .
next day still no call back .
frustrating because my son 's sports medicine specialist referred us .
i was informed it was canceled because only _num_ people were signed up .
just nasty .
get off your high horse people !
no follow up .
that is sloppy , sloppy , sloppy .
no note .
sloppy .
no thanks - i think i 'm officially done .
rude , offensive , inappropriate and snotty is all i can say .
`` ... are you kidding me ?
and to act like it my fault for disturbing your glorious day at work ?
do n't forget ... i 'm shopping .
customer service is a joke .
when asked to prove this she could n't .
i am very disappointed as it is a birthday gift from my husband .
what the hell it said open for _num_ more min .
only reason they get one star from us .
it 's very sad and i have no idea how she stays in business .
this is not a place i would recommend .
bottom line , still not done .
the calamari was boring and plain and just disappointing .
the house salad was boring and plain and well ... nothing special !
the shrimp were way over cooked , which just ruined the dish !
oh and do n't forget the tiramisu ... what the heck ... just terrible !
what a disappointing meal !
seafood and veg can be eaten .
zero stars .
three shrimp , and three scallops .
it was alright nothing wow .
unlimited garlic bread ... ok.
however , it has gotten worse and worse since then .
it was uncomfortable .
oh , and the food was disgusting on that night .
they obviously do n't operate well when they 're busy .
very dry , tough ... just gross .
in june , i went to eat for my birthday .
i miss you , uncle sal 's , but not that much .
this was not the case at all .
the food was just okay but the service was terrible .
i would never go back .
this was one of my worst experiences ever .
do n't waste your time or money here .
the food is average but service is horrible .
we have eaten there twice take out too actually .
nothing was offered .
very disappointing .
typical strip mall restaurant in south scottsdale .
looks totally outdated inside .
so not impressed .
you have got to be kidding me ?
cheap bread to fill up on .
and even then it would be subpar .
it was a mess .
at this point , we felt like we 'd been there forever .
bland , tasteless , cafeteria food .
you could probably get better frozen items at costco .
horrible service , rude manager i made reservations on monday for saturday .
arrived _num_ min .
did i mention we are sitting outside in the cold .
this is an italian restaurant , what could have taken an hour ?
should have comped the entire meal .
service is awful !
i wrote a review on sunday and now it 's gone ?
it was about their very , very poor service .
i was not impressed by this restaurant .
i make better alfredo sauce from scratch at home !
the lasagna was pretty tasteless too .
frankly i am disappointed .
service was painfully slow .
i do n't get it .
as for the dinner it was really just okay .
and that is not normal we leave _num_ to _num_ % almost always .
but nothing i 'd rave about .
the service is a bit sad .
not somewhere i 'd go for a low stress , relaxing dinner .
you get eaten alive while waiting for your food .
i agree he is very rude & surly .
could say more , but why bother !
i give them no stars .
a bit on the rude side as well ... service was n't that great .
they proceed to rush us thru our salads .
after every bite `` can i take that for you ?
nothing my mom did n't make for _num_ years for her family .
but the whole staff should be fired .
the other people in our party left as well .
this did n't go so well ... yikes !
lo and behold the menu says it 's an extra $ _num_ to share .
( i would have just not ordered one if i would have known ) .
but this is where things go downhill .
i 'm super disappointed by this place .
i think the biggest disappointment was the service .
my friend asked for the ravioli instead ... should n't be that hard .
not into it .
that was the first and only thing i could taste .
i could n't even taste the lemon at all .
they obviously have zero concern for customer satisfaction or service .
the iced tea was too strong .
our server could n't tell me what was in the stuffed mushrooms .
they should have left out the onions .
and they were stingy with the spaghetti too .
hubby 's sausage and peppers were average .
we took a piece of cheesecake home and it was awful !
sorry uncle sal 's just was not up to par .
awful food and even worse service .
my wife had the fettuccine alfredo and she did n't like it either .
what a waste of $ _num_ + tip for that grumpy host .
not pretentious yet homey feel .
not sure on return .
another bad italian take out story .
eggplant parm and spaghetti was anything but that .
two small bites smothered in sauce .
they lied and did not care .
avoid this cheap tasteless restaurant .
just another rip off joint .
now that i live _num_ minutes away , not so often .
the calamari is mediocre and actually smelled pretty bad the last time i went .
here 's why i 'm the most disappointed in this visit .
`` why so much need for car washing ? ''
getting it washed every two weeks or so feels normal out here .
just the car wash . ''
certainly not worth all the hassle .
the wash itself is n't that good .
last saturday i took my van in to get washed .
he looked inside and told me it would be $ _num_ .
he proceeded to tell me that he could n't do that for me .
and walked away .
the other reviews are correct , this place is horrible .
i dont understand why there were so many other patrons here on that day .
what a waste of money .
will not be back .
i speak from experience , waste of money .
is there a no star rating ?
i just went home and cleaned it myself .
_num_ weeks still no word from them on repairs .
the wash is nothing special .
the service is the worst .
turns out it has an expiration date within _num_ days .
they are going to look for an excuse to keep your money .
horrible service !
horrible attitudes !
i went to this car wash and they forced my automatic doors open .
it caused $ _num_ in damage .
i went to the dealer and had the door fixed ... _num_ .
i already wrote a review about this horrible place .
i ended up with a repair bill of $ _num_ .
horrible horrible horrible .
very disappointing .
they are not very busy , but have been around forever .
they do not go out of the way to make you car shine .
fail .
that was the only reason i picked that service .
he just started and me and said , sorry i ca n't honor it .
these guys lost a customer today .
i had to take the towel to wipe down my own car .
i would give this review a negative star if it was an option .
$ _num_ gets you a car wash and vacuum - nothing extra .
i was completely disappointed with the customer service from the car wash technicians .
do not waste your time and/or money at this car wash .
overall , this will be a waste of your time and money .
i will not be coming back here again and would appreciate a full refund !
i had a terrible experience here and would never go back .
it gets one star because you ca n't give it zero stars .
that is how they get your email address .
extremely rude workers .
no samples were offered on our way out either .
i will not be returning to this location .
then , i asked if one of the pieces i ordered were free .
so i asked why i was n't getting a free chocolate .
so i asked why i would be getting the free chocolate .
am i not tall enough for you ?
rude .
no , on second thought , it 's no shame at all .
the shame is on them .
not a good thing .
they had no record of having towed my car .
i must bring $ _num_ to get my car back .
my husband and i were there with a large group about _num_ of us .
the bartender was extremely rude and the security guy was even worse !
i 'm still wondering why the bartender amy is still there .
the sad thing is , every woman in our group had the same problem .
i 'm truly disgusted by her bad attitude .
first , it is very small .
it is old , think shack .
then there were the hipsters drinking pbr .
they could barely get the car doors open .
and the staff did nothing to stop them .
i will not be returning again .
that was outside my budget so i checked with _num_ independent mechanics .
i also asked for an oil change and a complete inspection .
he opted to pick up the car with nothing but the oil change done .
this is where it goes from bad to worse .
furthermore , my dad looks at everything before taking it in .
first thing he did n't find was an oil pan leak .
his mechanic also confirmed there was no leak .
fourth , oil level is low !
regardless , i just do n't feel i can trust marshall 's anymore .
garbage !
the whole student services department was wiped out .
the associates program is no longer an option .
the administration on the other hand , they just want your money .
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
ok , really ?
i want to be in a learning environment with people who care , too .
maybe i 'm asking too much ... but maybe i 'm not .
get a job washing dishes at a restaurant or bakery if you have to .
_num_ stars .
this place is a total scam !
i went here until i realized it was a scam .
no real education .
they just want your money and do n't give a crap about the students .
it is not worth it .
you will loose going here .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
did not realize until later it was at _num_ % .
this place is just bad news .
i only had _num_ that were worth a damn !
the rest were idiots !
sure they know what they are talking about but they could care less .
i was n't very impressed with this class .
lost some respect for the school after that .
in _num_ years the degree helped me get _num_ job .
crap over priced education .
_num_ days pass , nothing in the mail .
i called the school after hours and left a message .
my suggestion would be to not go here .
this is a school for people that can not get into a real university .
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
i mean that 's been my experience !
chef cones by and says `` what happened here ? ''
attended _num_ for my associates in pastry .
i got the worst infection from the salon !
first time here , no i did not have an appt .
ok nothing new .
then she tells me , she had someone come in that had an appt .
i am now also using tea tree oil to help .
luckily for them , i do n't call the better business bureau .
my girlfriend found this place and it was awful !
the manicure was not good .
turns out it was n't because it came to $ _num_ .
i stopped because i thought it would be fun to have fake nails again .
when i walked in , i was not greeted .
should have listened to my gut .
she finished my nails in about _num_ minutes .
the nails are sloppy , sharp and uneven .
( pictures to follow ) then came the last kicker .
i said that the price list said $ _num_ .
she said `` no , $ _num_ ) .
i paid and left and will not be back .
they are still in pretty rough shape -- -- use caution at this salon !
not cleaned between customers !
empty .
seems so annoyed by me the whole time .
sorry to ruin your empty salon , dude .
massage was worthless .
basically just rubbed his hands around and stared out the window .
no cleaning what so ever !
so gross .
this is by far the worst manicure i have ever received .
shitty , shitty , shitty .
the massage was terrible and he used a tiny drop of lotion .
the guy that did my acrylics was as rude as they come .
i would n't go back even if it was free .
if there was a no zero star this is what this place would get .
if you dont know how to wax , please dont .
no tip !
this was one of the worst experiences in nail salons i have ever had .
when i said no , he rolled his eyes and shook his head .
if i ever looked him in the eye he stared me down .
meh , it 's too `` this is my new haircut '' scene .
seriously - this place is too cool for itself .
otherwise , forget about it .
this was the absolute worst bar i have ever been to .
i heard the music from the sidewalk and would n't even walk in .
what a basic and lame name .
i did not see any reason to go in there .
worst place ever !
the police department was n't any better .
would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
mediocre is a compliment for what my family and i just ate .
and $ _num_ later for two adults and two kids ?
no character .
avoid .
ugh soo disappointing !
ordered cajun chicken salad but got the buffalo chicken instead .
ordered takeout and did n't check it before leaving !
well , the chicken was hella dry and bland except for the buffalo sauce .
too much bbq sauce .
i ordered the scottsdale salad , it was served with raw chicken .
small little place , good beer , but i would n't recommend it .
i do n't know how this place got the reviews it did .
wo n't be coming here again .
heck no .
have they contacted me about the higher price i paid for extra service ?
contact me to offer to refund the higher fee ?
did they lie and email me it had shipped ?
i doubt they could do even that .
f bombs included .
on the other hand , the food leaves much to be desired .
the food here is uninspired , bland , and borderline gross .
nothing was even decent !
_num_ thumbs way down !
our order for shrimp with the paella became squid .
we felt like tourists in a strange place getting ripped off at every chance .
i could n't have said it better josh ( 1st review ) !
i do n't recommend going there .
typical overrated scottsdale eatery .
we had already been to happy hour so were not interested in dinner .
the service sucked !
clearly time has not be kind to this place .
sorry , not planning on go back after reading other reviews .
the spanish cuisine is very much americanized .
the paella , was hardly a paella .
but that does n't explain the previous two visits .
we went here late _num_ and had a buy _num_ get _num_ free coupon .
i am of spanish descent and this place is a disgrace to my heritage .
i had to come on here to recommend that people not visit this place .
they have it all wrong .
the appetizers were some of the worst i 've had in phoenix .
nasty overcooked sausage , stale bread , flat cheap cheeses -- just plain gross .
the prices here are way too high for what you get .
please spare yourself the disappointment and skip out on this place .
terrible .
however , the food was terrible .
it was stuck in the _num_ 's .
the server also charged us for _num_ salads that she just brought out .
it was awful .
it was worse than any drive bars i have been to .
no salads and the bread was served with ranch dressing ( no butter ) .
our drinks remained empty for most of the night including the water .
the food was pretty poor and the portions were horrible .
one glass of sangria each and the bill was $ _num_ .
bad move !
mom was upset enough to write her own bad review of the restaurant .
( i did n't even know she had a yelp account ! )
this includes two entrees , a pitcher of sangria , and an appetizer .
therefore , instead of two , there were three at the table .
so on to the last entree which was a dry aged steak and shrimp .
do n't buy the groupon you will regret it .
hmmm , not bad i thought .
instead , a garlicky ranch type dressing .
he did n't want rice so he got vegetables .
the chicken was overdone , but the taste of the sauce was good .
mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can .
empanadas & shrimp wrapped in bacon .
not here .
the waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer .
just dump stuff in the eggs and you 're done .
the food was ok , but the service was awful .
i dragged my husband there just so we could use it .
my husband was right - do n't buy groupons !
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .
overpriced menu and they wonder why it is half empty on a friday night !
the others are just ok .
one star dinner - i wish i could give this a higher rating .
i ordered it here about _num_ years ago , it was better that night .
i was going to order a different drink , but the waiter never asked .
the steak was `` fine , ' not good flavor but edible .
my _num_ boneless chicken breasts were perfectly uniform under a mushroom sauce .
the chicken was weird .
after two bites , i quit .
gross .
it 's got ta suck to serve such bad food ) .
( it 's really dated inside , to boot . )
a big waste of money !
i wish i would have read the reviews first .
so , we ending up spending $ _num_ !
the sangria was not good at all !
this is the second time i have been there with a groupon .
i do n't know if we 'll be back , which is very sad .
service : nothing special and she overcharged us by double .
bland , and waaaay overpriced .
ps this review has been in my drafts for a while .
this place sucked !
bland food and horrible service .
i would avoid this location at all cost .
food was poor , service indifferent .
i doubt i 'll be back .
the service was horrible .
the waitress spoke _num_ words if at all to us .
she was not happy being there .
water waitress would n't leave us alone .
i felt rushed even though it was empty on a saturday night .
i had an expired groupon that i was going to use paid value for .
however , he failed to understand and was rude .
the decor was outdated .
the problem came when we received the bill .
the food was not that great , and over priced !
the dancing was cool but very loud .
he did n't mention that they bring out complementary bread .
maybe he gets into trouble for not immediately filling up waters or taking plates ?
i got so sick from their food that i had to do it .
please avoid this place if you value your health .
get over yourself .
ra is awful .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
no serious complaints about the food , but the service is just atrocious .
i did n't know ra was a chain .
i liked the crunch of the salmon skin , the flavor was not bad .
ambiance is not bad .
service was really slow .
overall , i would not go back .
i was n't satisfied and yet the bill for lunch was $ _num_ !
ra appears to cater to people who are looking for americanized japanese food .
the food is not great , but neither is it truly terrible .
but if you 're looking for great sushi , go elsewhere .
it was a monday evening and the restaurant was only 1/3 full .
the music was a little too loud and the interior was predictable .
trendy , over priced , typical snotty scottsdale attitudes .
the only thing they have that i adore is their iced green tea .
i 'd never pay that much for shitty sushi again .
we got an assortment of sushi , rolls , sashimi , etc .
the fish was fresh but the rolls were n't very impressive .
they were almost over the top and trying to hard .
( hence the _num_ stars ) .
i think the only authentic japanese item in this place was my watch .
this is the all time worst place to eat sushi .
the food is not good either .
the food finally arrived and it was gross .
i ca n't even finish this review i am getting so irritated !
however , the prices are very reasonable for lunch .
one star because i ca n't give zero .
the restaurant was crowded and the music really loud .
what a mistake .
i was pissed !
a manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit .
find your sushi elsewhere in scottsdale !
service was terrible and annoying and the music is to loud .
i wait _num_ minutes for my food , which tastes fine to me .
all the while , i am ignored by the wait staff .
you 're not that cool !
i 'm not going back , not even on a bet .
there 's plenty of better sushi places in the valley .
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
the sushi itself is nothing special .
scottsdale ra does n't really impress me .
with so many other sushi choices , it 's not a destination of choice .
sushi is bland and not anything to write home about .
we had a group of six and waited _num_ minutes for sushi orders .
empty glasses and no follow up on wtf happened to our order .
i tried _num_ different items but was most impressed with the tempura shrimp .
never again ... if they had a _num_ star i would give it .
i was very disappointed with our service at ra .
it then took almost _num_ minutes to get the check !
way too noise !
really - rolling sushi would take that long ?
this was the worst service i 've ever gotten anywhere - ever !
this place sucks .
the service is horrible .
the manager was worse .
horrible service !
she over charge my meal not once , not twice , but three times .
they gave me happy hour prices for drinks but not for my food .
if i had not would of been over charged over $ _num_ .
i will not be back to this location .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
overall , pretty forgettable .
the vegetarian selections here are slim .
`` yeah , but it 's only like _num_ % eel .
well , thank goodness i 'm only a _num_ % vegetarian , right ?
uninspired rolls , at times with stale fish , mediocre service , tired decor .
service is ok , not stellar .
i am a restaurant manager and have _num_ years of service industry experience .
mistakes sometimes happen , excuses should not .
do not waste your money here .
it made the whole experience a great deal worse .
ra in scottsdale has gone down hill slowly ever since the owners sold out .
one can not even eat their sushi .
they use white flour in the rice to keep in from sticking .
the worst service i have ever had .
not impressed .
imagine how pissed i was .
the spicy tuna roll was unbelievable ... and not in a good way .
the shrimp tempura roll fell completely apart when i picked it up .
fail .
all the sushi was hot no sign of it ever being cold .
my last time here was an absolute disaster .
out of a lot of fish especially for a sunday lunch ... .
seems they 've dropped the ball .
i went on a friday afternoon and it was dead !
the bartender was weird .
the sushi , was sushi , i guess .
overall the experience and food was a waste of $ _num_ bucks .
the bad : the food is n't impressive , especially for the cost .
the crispy roll was n't crispy , more ... the opposite of crispy .
the ugly : ugh , their service !
actually , just keep walking .
reminds me why i stopped eating here before ... .
ra sushi is so-so for sushi .
it 's not spectacular , but usually not terrible either .
i do n't know what was going at the bar .
overall , a so-so experience .
service was slow and in attentive .
the miso soup was very salty and fishy .
it also takes a really really long time to get any sushi rolls .
we did n't realize it until the correct one came next .
no worries , not a big deal .
the flavors were bland , even the on with jalapenos in it .
she looked embarrassed and offered us a dessert .
that is completely unacceptable and unprofessional .
the atmosphere is n't too stuffy and usually entertaining .
i was so disappointed to know it was n't available at this one .
_num_ % dissatisfied .
we had a party of six and ordered _num_ different sushi rolls .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
it was extremely over priced and the sushi was nothing to get excited about .
service was horrible !
over _num_ hours to get food delivered to table .
no , thank you , but no .
it was definitely crowded so we were lucky to find two seats together .
i drank it so it would go away .
i hate that , how the hell am i supposed to eat this ?
the chop sticks could hardly even hold the weight and size of the thing .
so i pick it up ... it falls apart .
the food sucks , the drinks suck , the atmosphere sucks .
sat on patio , tables and chairs way to close .
wait stuff was good but sushi was inconsistent , ie pieces not same size .
rice was n't wrapped all the way around rolls .
overpriced and not even very good .
still terrible for all the same reasons .
i took _num_ friends to lunch here today .
the hostess was no where to be found .
no one would even acknowledge that we were there !
the service was terrible .
however the customer service is a bit lacking .
they told me to take _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later i got my to go food .
sushi was ok , nothing special .
the service was horrible .
ridiculous .
i am not sure if i will return or not .
so just ate at raw sushi for the first time with my new bf .
everything was great , no complaints , except for the service .
the server was overly attentive to the point of annoying .
it made it difficult to maintain the flow of our conversation .
i felt rushed through my meal and dining experience .
the hostesses were not professional and the servers were even worse !
unfortunately we wo n't be returning .
i 've been going to ra sushi for _num_ yrs .
bringing in a new washed up dj wo n't save them .
properly train your servers .
it then takes _num_ minutes to flag someone down and that 's super annoying .
no one wants to pay $ _num_ for shitty sushi .
your specials are atrocious .
i 've provided too many excuses for this place and enough is enough .
the sushi was luke warm and old tasting like it 's been sitting out .
but their service is horrible .
i sat there for _num_ minutes and no one came to me .
another mid age white guy later on sat _num_ seats away from me .
but it 's not .
and then there is n't even an apology .
dude , you 're not busy ... there is no excuse .
overpriced sushi , and not so good .
food is good but service is lacking .
sick service , if you want to waste your time come here .
first thing first , i 'm from chicago ; i love ra .
but i 've been on vacation here in arizona since june .
but when i came back , she was no longer here !
i do n't understand because my server this time was terrible .
i wish you guys would hire her again .
so that makes it comes down to the customer service .
big mistake .
but nonetheless , the edamame and the sake bombs were perfection as always .
the staff is rude also .
do not bother .
this was the worst thing i have ever tasted .
the entire time our waitress was never there , never refilled our drinks .
bad decision .
i will first give you the worst .
gross .
no roll should be so big that you ca n't fit in your mouth .
that just goes to show the chef does not know japanese cuisine .
watered down .
not much flavor .
so , will i come back to this restaurant ?
this was a bad choice on my part .
bad , slow service .
poor sushi selection .
no wine menu .
ambiance was that of a cheap , generic restaurant .
so we stopped going for a while .
not what you want to see !
i could n't even eat it , so gave to my bf .
service- this is by far the worst thing about this restaurant .
this is a total failure of this restaurant design .
i was very sick the night after .
my steak was cooked next to someone 's chicken .
additionally , the steak was very cold when it was served to me .
this place just does not have good japanese food .
even something simple like chicken teriyaki and miso soup were not great .
and the sushi and the sashimi were just not that great .
so glad to be back in la for yummy japanese food again !
the sushi is just barely above average .
they do n't cook the fried rice in front of you .
the vegetables tasted like ... vegetables ... minus flavor .
one star for the most terrible service in recent memory .
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
i literally had to spit out my first bite of sashimi ( tuna ) .
it was the most fishy and rough piece of fish i 've ever tasted .
i apologized and told her that i was unable to eat it .
the food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating !
anyway , i have been twice for a dinner and it has been sub-par .
they do not allow service animals in their restaurant .
we have never been denied access to a restaurant before .
this is not very american .
anyway no go for animal lovers !
not impressed .
my husband and i visited this past weekend for the second time .
when we arrived _num_ mins earlier , the restaurant was dead .
the chef came quickly and our food was all prepared in _num_ mins .
my main complaint concerns the portions of food .
the steak was overcooked and he also received _num_ shrimp .
do n't expect much from this place .
place is dingy , especially for it being in scottsdale .
while the lunch menu prices are great , the sashimi quality remains off .
each time , my miso soup was barely warm , and not very flavorful .
`` , nothing further from the truth was experienced by our family .
disgusting .
i get to visit scottsdale once every _num_ years or so on average .
throwing caution to the wind , we decided to try this place .
you have to understand , this is a hole in the wall joint .
ok , so this hostess brings silverware , chips and menus at different times .
by this time , i am thinking the food better be freakin ' awesome .
the mole sauce was way too smoky .
the standard rice and beans sides were very forgettable .
with that combination met , i did n't really mind the wait .
the place was n't packed and had a good atmosphere about it .
not too hectic , nice and laid back .
the service is what really ruined it for us .
honey , i 've had better mexican food in dc .
the pork tamales was too thick and dried .
the cheese enchilada was a joke .
not an easy job but they made it !
so , they alone deserve a star .
nonetheless , i would n't recommend this place to friends .
food was mediocre .
nothing really all that special to yelp about .
just another mediocre food experience .
if anything , it 's gotten worse .
i mean , really atrocious .
not even bean taste .
to add insult to injury the whole meal was swimming .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
this place was just ok.
i had the carnitas taco special which was two tacos with rice and beans .
when they arrived the tortillas were corn , greasy and soft .
not so good .
my mom 's soft tacos were strangely served upside down .
it went downhill from there .
the mole may have been worse .
canned fish in the tacos ... really ?
no bueno .
a margarita out of a bottle should not cost seven bucks .
wow , was this one a disappointment !
we ( me plus _num_ ) get there and they are super busy .
i asked _num_ times for the tortillas ... that never came .
this is going no where quickly , so allow me to land the plane .
have to pay for chips .
the margaritas are terrible and they do n't have frozen ones .
the meat in the burrito tasted like over spiced rubber .
the staff was highly lazy .
unfortunately , the service sucked .
then _num_ minutes to get us menus , water , and chips .
then , almost _num_ minutes to get the food out .
but , i was with my children on a school night .
this place was horrible , service was the worst i 've ever had !
do n't ever ask for more chips , second basket is $ _num_ !
you 're better off at taco bell .
lazy staff !
there was no attempt at service delivery , making it right , etc .
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .
it was completely wrong .
at least you know going into it that the food will be mediocre .
went with another couple to get caught up over christmas time .
horrible service right from the start .
forever for the check , which was not worth the price .
too bad cause we 're locals who love mexican food .
there are really no words to describe how terrible this place is .
every time i eat here , i swear i will never go back .
the tortillas were stale , cold , and awful .
there were some raw onions .
i 've had just about everything on the menu , and its all terrible .
this place makes its money on the tourists coming to spring training .
i wish i could give it negative stars .
margarita was lousy .
chips were ok but salsa was n't .
chicken mole enchiladas tasted like the mole came from a can .
it 's too bad because i love mexican food .
thank goodness there 's a mcdonalds on the way home .
well , unfortunately what he wrote was n't what i ordered .
and no two ways about it , he was right and i was wrong .
not the best attitude for the hospitality industry .
still , not up to the ratings or expectations .
now we are regular restaurant patrons .
much like the restaurants down in tucson .
but sadly , this is was the only positive for the restaurant .
beans and rice were not good at all .
the sopapillas were good , but that is not hard to mess up .
not worth your time .
food was very good but service was slow .
unfortunately , the food was terrible .
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day .
i will not be eating there again .
i ordered the enchiladas with chicken .
i was so disappointed , but starving so i ate it .
the guacamole was really disappointing too .
the salsa was too watery , just a little heat to it .
one plus is they have pitchers of beer and margaritas .
i will not be returning to this restaurant ever again !
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star , service is horrible .
do n't bother with this dump , huge let down .
lazy staff .
a very poor excuse for mexican food .
after another lengthy wait , my veggie burrito finally arrived .
the service was horrible .
they never told us in advance .
really disappointing .
did i mention the service was horrible .
and they were n't even that busy .
never brought drinks needed to remind them four times for silverware ?
very bad food .
salsa was ok but the eggs were awful how does this place stay open ?
they served us huevos rancheros with burnt fries dried up cheese .
what a disappointment .
however , this food was sub par .
the salsa was watery and i could have made the enchiladas much better myself .
absolutely nothing stood out about this place .
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
green is almost flavorless in comparison .
i should also give props to the server as he was prompt and attentive !
f & l 's is decent , but not my cup of tea .
obviously nobody is there to take care of this place .
food was alright , but definately not the best .
did i say terrible management ?
very , very bland .
service was a _num_ on a scale of _num_ to _num_ as well .
woman said they were already closed but website says open until _num_ pm .
ordered a large margarita , which was okay , nothing phenomenal .
shrimp enchiladas was not up to par .
the enchilada sauces came on the side and did n't taste yummy .
chicken tacos had bland chicken and came on crunchy shells , which was unexpected .
rice and beans that came with both meals were disgusting .
chips & salsa only free the first round .
the waitress at the end also tried to overcharge us .
i left her an awful tip .
_num_ of us ate lunch there yesterday .
_num_ had burritos .
_num_ did n't .
we called the restaurant and they did n't seem to care .
my two sons and daughter in law are all still sick .
what server does n't check in on drinks , especially when the food arrives ?
i also had to go to the bar to get my silverware .
with a lot of options , this place is a no go .
waited for _num_ min for a table on a week night .
and that was the only redeeming quality of the place .
the food was bland , soggy and basic .
unfortunately the food itself was n't very good .
the two entrees was nothing special .
rice was a little dry , beans okay .
let 's begin with the positives .
there are many other spots that could have been created for this purpose .
let 's just leave it at i wo n't be going back .
it was so not spicy and not flavorful .
my chicken enchiladas had the chicken on top of the rolled tortilla with cheese .
that just seems plain lazy to me .
i was really hoping that it would be better .
the food was below average which was very disappointing .
they also forgot our desert .
just an all around lame experience .
i should mail this place my hospital bill .
thought i was going to die after eating at the sh*t hole .
the food 's not too bad .
the only nice thing is the patio .
staff unfriendly , food terrible .
probably the worst mexican food i have ever had .
maybe if we had been drinking it would have tasted better .
i had just purchased those coupons about a month before .
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
the manager came over and apologized , but it was really too late .
i asked so is it americanized mexican food ?
i said to the employee , `` i know bruschetta are twice baked cookies .
the burrito is the worst burrito i have ever had .
i ate one bite and could not eat any more .
the employees do not seem to know anything about the food they are serving .
very bad .
we had been here maybe _num_ years ago and did not remember much .
this has to be one of the worst .
when in doubt , do n't stretch the kitchen .
both our dinners were bad .
not even warm .
tasteless , greasy .
the only condiment on the table was salt & pepper .
to top off the nite , hubby needed to use the restroom .
food does not make up for slow and poor service .
service was extremely slow , appetizers were not even warm .
will not go back !
this place gets _num_ stars from most .
_num_ from me .
nothing special except the patio atmosphere was nice .
margarita nothing special but was $ _num_ .
guac had no flavor .
the service was horrible , the food was mediocre .
for a restaurant located in old scottsdale i would expect better .
i ordered shrimp fajitas and there were no tortillas included !
by the time the tortillas arrived , my food was cold .
right around _num_ hours .
the food was decent but nothing special .
the service was horrible .
dead , but still ants .
, i am disappointed in the service and the cleanliness .
disappointed does n't even begin to cut it .
how he missed it , i 'll never know .
it was disgusting .
not an apology .
not a discount offered .
never returning again .
soggy and bland tacos .
i 'm not picky , but thats just a tad bit unprofessional .
so why the bad review ?
unfortunately my take - out order really did n't hit the mark .
i had the shredded beef burrito and a cheese crisp .
the burrito was in an extremely soggy tortilla .
like soggy to the point of being inedible mush .
the biggest upset was our takeout order did not come with chips .
i really do n't get it .
overall , really disappointing .
i ca n't imagine the need to return here .
i do n't see how this place was so busy .
i came with my husband and _num_ year old son .
so , i went to ask her for one .
we ordered chile rellenos , mini tacos , and carnitas enchiladas with green sauce .
the chile rellenos were made with cheddar cheese .
that is not the way we know them to be made .
my husband did n't even get nearly a quarter cup of sides .
sat down and told the waiter we were only here for one shot .
i have been to this restaurant probably about a dozen times .
we ordered _num_ waters , a pepsi , and a margarita .
pepsi was n't refilled .
pretty much made our dining experience very unpleasant .
do n't bother coming here .
our server forgot to put my order in and got my friends order wrong .
expensive and not that great .
but between the _num_ orders for dinner , we had issues with all _num_ .
service is poor .
ca n't make a cheese crisp with green chilies without it being soggy .
server never once came to check on my or refill my drink .
its been this way the last _num_ times i was here .
i ordered the shredded beef tacos and they were not greasy like most places .
the rice needs a little more flavor , but beans were good .
the food at this place was quite greasy and lacking flavor .
i do not recommend this for visitors looking for authentic mexican food .
got terrible food poisoning !
it just does n't seem like they care .
not so much .
in case of fire in the main room i think you 're screwed .
the service is lacking too .
for a great mexican meal , not so much .
usually great but tonight the service was horrible .
the service was mediocre .
chips tasted stale and like old oil , salsa was ok .
the service was mediocre .
chips tasted stale and like old oil , salsa was ok .
the nachos were sent back due to flavor of oil and ordered something different .
terrible service .
horrible !
i found it to be very bland and flavorless .
i 'm pretty sure it was just sauted vegetables in a bland flour tortilla .
i ordered the dark mexican draft beer , which was served way too warm .
so there you have it , even the beer was disappointing !
only served us and then left only returned with the bill .
do n't let the awesome decor and delicious smells fool you .
horrible service and mediocre , over-priced food !
there were no peppers !
chicken was chewy and did n't have much flavor .
i could get better fajitas at chilis .
will not be going back .
terrible food , terrible service and a depressing place to be .
maybe i came on a bad night .
it tasted like a severely watered down margarita .
the carnitas were very bland and tasted like they had freezer burn .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
while the food was decent , the service was absolutely awful .
no one came to seat us for about _num_ minutes to start off .
horrible service- they could not have cared less we were there .
very disappointing .
went to tee pee mexican food who could not have been more accommodating .
during that last visit the service was so bad we wrote the place off .
you could see why sitting there .
our drinks were dry and chip basket was empty .
no refills , no chips .
he did n't even inquire about us wanting more .
we then could n't get our bill for anything .
it 's a shame .
i see a kitchen nightmares in it 's future .
consider yourself warned .
food was very bland , bland , bland .
mexican food should not be bland .
i do n't normally write bad reviews , but this place deserves one .
so we walked over time frank & luke 's .
_num_ hour and _num_ minutes later we finally got a table .
no apology , no grace or consideration .
gross !
plus my husband got sick a few days after eating .
just gross all together .
i 'd avoid this place at all costs !
the guacamole tasted like the powdered instant kind .
it certainly is n't worth eating here considering the quality of food and cost .
there are far too many better mexican restaurants in the area .
frank just shrugged and walked off .
eateries .
the poor way in which it was handled was very disappointing .
what a disappointment !
i used to frequent this restaurant about ten years ago often .
my hubby and i checked it out the other day while in the area .
food did not taste fresh at all .
beans were bland and tortilla was somewhat stale .
too bad the food is less than average .
stopped in for lunch despite poor reviews .
turned out it was fajita style chicken in a flour tortilla .
the chicken was very bland and a little tough .
my dish was equally bland .
this is a sad review for me .
my grandparents have been regulars for years and know most of the people there .
i should have listened to papa .
poor poor timing in the kitchen .
especially to make an older lady wait for her food , not cool .
no , just some odds and ends they have leftover it seemed like .
it was horrible .
mediocre food .
a group of gals hit this place for a late lunch on a friday .
the service was slow and he was rude and cold .
the service left something to be desired , especially a hot hospitable italian man .
however , it 's been a little while since the last visit .
it was very disappointing .
i was craving pasta with something ... something i ca n't make at home .
i do n't know .
neither did the olive oil - that was a little bit thin , too .
i mean , my food was not bad .
but that 's just it - it did n't blow me away .
it looked like it had cheese on top .
no shit , it 's lasagna .
i have never written a yelp review before .
this has nothing to do with the pasta , which was mediocre at best .
i walked out not that excited .
for me when it comes to pasta , i am a bit picky .
my first course was a caesar salad .
wait take that back .
that was supposed to be my first course .
this left me sad .
my main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne .
where do i begin on this crap fest ?
this my friend is not italian .
my wife and i were starving when we got in .
it 's the only reason this place is getting their _num_ star .
we got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting .
i took a bite and could n't eat anymore .
my wife was so hungry , she ate it all .
she did n't care .
she thought it was gross too .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
it made me pretty sick .
my salmon was smelly ( very fishy ) and overcooked .
he did n't ask why we were sending it back .
overall , avoid at all cost .
the place is not cheap and you are not getting your money 's worth .
where to start , let 's just saw awful !
this time -- `` eh '' .
probably wo n't go back .
unfortunately , the food was less then mediocre at best .
also , their bruschetta was not good at all .
i would not recommend the restaurant .
later on the original waiter came and said he 'd help us out .
later on the original waiter came back to take our order .
another 3rd waiter came back with our drinks about _num_ minutes later .
these guys were all nice but not very on the ball and generally overwhelmed .
meal tickets were getting lost , it was mass mass chaos .
he refused to answer only stating that he would get the waiter .
after reading the menu for _num_ minutes our waiter returned to take our order .
i quickly got up and located my waiter notified him of what had happened .
apologized and stated our meals would be out shortly .
_num_ % higher price for drinks and food _num_ feet from the bar .
they lost us as customers & we live in the neighborhood !
so disappointing .
wedge had wilted lettuce , tasteless tomato and the blue cheese had zero flavor .
overall not good at all .
too bad , used to be great .
what came first , no business or crap ingredients and no chef ?
we also did n't get a menu for almost _num_ minutes .
the food was very mediocre - not terrible , but nothing special .
in my opinion , definitely not worth the hour wait .
the atmosphere and service were fine but the food was disappointing .
disappointing food in both our meals .
save your money , there are several better choices within walking distance .
i tried the chef salad and the quality was just low .
the pasta does n't even taste pasta .
the rigatoni were overcooked and the cheese was bitter and just not good .
the caesar salad was n't that bad , but neither special .
i am sorry but i wo n't come back .
ugh .
they were not wearing any hair hats and it was not sanitary .
my chicken was swimming in butter , i could n't even eat it .
the decor was nice , pretty typical for a small italian restaurant .
a party of eight came in after us and left _num_ minutes before us .
not too happy with them .
not like they used to be .
ruins the meal .
no signs stating the hours of operation .
i really appreciated driving out of my way for nothing .
avoid at all costs should really be _num_ stars .
not cool !
not very happy about this at all .
so i proceed to go every 5-7 days for shots .
my last appointment to this office was back in october _num_ .
uh , i know i 'm heavy .
unless i want to continue doing the shots .
dr. cohen even had dr. lee come in to talk to me .
call me picky , but i like cheese on my pizza .
warning ... make sure to look at your bill !
our waiter was just kinda weird .
and not in a good way .
he was the employee , should n't he have led the conversation ?
the boyfriend and i ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza .
parking was not to great.
the food sucked ... .
they will sooooo not get my money again !
calzone was full of ricotta and cheese .
nope , no flavor .
garlic pizza was okay .
i will not be going back anytime soon .
unfortunately , i have to say i was disappointed in grimaldi 's = ( .
they have no `` signature '' pizzas , it 's all build your own .
i ordered a side of red sauce to dip my pesto pizza in .
it was watery and flavorless , it needed garlic and salt !
so we spent _num_ dollars on a ruined dinner .
i quickly went elsewhere .
no flavor .
too flat .
we stopped recently for lunch and had an excellent pie .
then we wait another _num_ for drinks , and finally the pizza showed up .
so you ca n't get a pizza until 5:30 .
dumb .
bar service- awful .
my friends and i were treated so rudely by not _num_ but _num_ bartenders .
it was so bad , i wish they could get negative stars .
the pizza here is just not very good .
although the former is tasty , the latter is a waste of tomatoes .
so save your money and go to oregano 's where they are not pretentious .
the pizza was bland , as was the staff .
so disappointed .
i just usually avoid it because i feel it is too expensive .
the pizza was done quite fast , however , it look completely disgusting .
i most likely will not come back .
shame shame shame .
there are no appetizers , just salads for starters .
the red sauce has no flavor .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
i had a calzone which was yummy but the service ruined the experience .
our server was friendly but inattentive and inexperienced .
gross !
flavorless and overpriced .
obnoxious .
the place was n't packed , but did have some tables .
we had terrible service .
the food was n't anything special .
i would n't go again .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
_num_ stars only because our server was cool .
i used to go to grimaldi 's all the time , but not anymore .
oh , i should not have asked .
i have no idea why this restaurant has been rated so highly .
anyways we also were told we had to pay for our meals as well .
no guest should be treated this way .
this may be one of the worst restaurant experiences i have ever been to .
horrible service !
we walked along scottsdale rd .
this was very disappointing especially after now reading about how good their food is .
very disappointed !
we booked for a party of _num_ but reduced down to _num_ .
crust was flavorless and limp .
ingredients diversity was not also available .
do not recommend .
in keeping with chain restaurants style , the food is very unimpressive .
my house salad with grilled chicken was lackluster to say the least .
the only plus was the attentive and helpful wait staff .
i wish they would not charge for extra sauce .
other than this , the pizza is like the original .
unfortunately , it seems like the quality has gone downhill as the chain expanded .
plus i feel like the menu used to have more options .
after our visit yesterday i am still disappointed !
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
my moms personal pizza ended up to be $ _num_ .
other than the manager , most else was a zero .
dined here after the cardinals game on a saturday night around 10:30 .
by the time the manager stopped by we were talking about going elsewhere .
eventually ordered a large half garden , half margarita .
no flavor and they forgot the tomato sauce .
thankfully the manager was quick to check in and quickly offered to make another .
the new pie was better but somewhat watery .
the margarita side was better but also need excessive parmesan to taste well .
wish i had taken a picture !
terrible pizza and way overpriced .
bad , bad and more bad .
they could seem to care less .
all in all just bad !
i want to leave _num_ stars !
with the new management , this place has become a lot less awesome .
all kinds even bugs that i 've never seen before .
which tells you i 'm tired of it .
it 's expensive but not worth the money .
the gym has n't been functional in months since i 've been here .
have had nothing but maintenance and pest problems .
after the new manager came in , everything has gone downhill .
you can do so much better for less than what they charge .
calamari , overcooked .
_num_ orders of veal , overcooked .
we ate here while on a weekend get away .
we then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine .
however , we will no longer patronize such rude service .
as _num_ year patrons , we are no longer supporting their establishment .
look at my wait , get the hell out .
wrong .
needless to say , we went somewhere else .
never again will i go back .
the service is outrageously bad .
owner was absolutely rude to our party of _num_ .
i would rather eat at mcdonalds than this place .
save your money and skip this hole in the wall .
the other people in my party agree that the restaurant was terrible .
we too never got an opportunity to eat here .
just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude .
he approached me and said you looking for someone .
he said why are you asking me questions ?
if i could give zero stars i would .
worst host service i 've ever experienced .
asked several times but i do n't think he could add or tell time .
can i give negative stars ?
never have i been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar .
all he said was `` leave '' and walked away from us .
my boyfriend said , `` let 's just get out of here .
this place sucks anyway . ''
what the hell !
what a fake establishment !
very questionable service to me .
there was no wait here on a wednesday night around 7:30 !
too buttery and not enough bread !
no lie _num_ dollars for _num_ ravioli .
yes they were good but lukewarm and not enough for that ridiculous price .
i would not waste my time .
service is garbage .
waiter did n't tell us specials , barely paid attention to us .
gross .
i sent my family tonight for dinner .
leave ?
horrible .
waiting _num_ minutes ?
terrible customer service .
unbelievable .
go to this restaurant !
what a horrible experience we had with a party of _num_ on march 10th .
was drinking beers was rude and extremely unprofessional .
do not go to this restaurant .
horrible .
he had definately raised the price on my lunch meal by $ _num_ !
should we start with the ambiance , people watching or wine selection .
my girlfriend ordered veal piccata and the dish was too salty to eat .
she sent the plate back a second time .
this place is horrible .
i wish i could tell you the chicken is rubber .
confused ?
then my review has served its purpose .
and do not go here if you want friendly service .
the service either ends up great , or crap .
wow i really wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
although the food was pretty good the service was terrible .
decided on grotto because of the reviews but could n't be disappointed more .
it 's not the way we want to spend a nice evening .
if i could , i would give this place zero stars !
the waiter was completely irritated by every question we asked .
with no explanation or apology .
cannoli was good but way overpriced at $ _num_ .
worst dining experience ever .
the waiter was extremely rude .
the worst customer experience ever !
would not recommend .
spend your $ $ $ $ elsewhere .
the short gentleman approved and was so rude and condescending to us .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
do n't waste your time .
one of the worst experiences i 've ever had in scottsdale .
i can not believe all the good reviews here .
and they did n't need our business as they 're always packed .
he also suggested i write a terrible review so i thought i should .
huge mistake !
i would n't give this place another hard earned dime !
cons -- ugh , where do i start ?
honestly , we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place .
our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant .
the management was just terrible .
that is $ _num_ i 'll never spend on a meal there again .
oh , and their bread was extremely hard and cold .
i recently ate at this restaurant and had a horrible experience .
our waiter was rude , lazy and condescending and the owner was even worse .
avoid this place at all costs !
i am so disappointed .
the crepes in the cannelloni were very rubbery and the filling lacked flavor .
our server was and the owner was not here .
the server comes up no apology or anything , but again no biggie .
lastly , we asked the owner of the restaurant he was the worst .
the service not only ruined our dinner , but the rest of our night .
salty canned clam sauce .
terrible cafeteria salad .
no fresh pasta to be seen .
this is college cafeteria italian .
the place screams `` i ca n't be bothered '' with customers .
not only are we disgusted at the nasty bug !
they still write out your bill by hand .
service was tolerable .
i regret spending money to eat here .
it was not prepared as explained in the menu and chicken overcooked .
nothing is worse than overcooked chicken .
the owner is a complete jerk and a drunk .
i will never visit this place again !
the servers are very unfriendly .
so disappointed !
the tiramisu was probably the worst tiramisu i 've ever had .
our fault for not looking at the menu .
but what a rip off .
but definitely not worth it for old coffee and stale probably store bought tiramisu .
the owner of this restaurant is the rudest person i have ever encountered .
i do not often wish i 'll will upon another person .
last night _num_ of my girlfriends and i had dinner here .
i had the chilean sea bass and it was divine .
for dessert we all shared _num_ cannolis which tasted heavenly .
our bill arrived and we know that they do n't do separate checks .
are you kidding me ?
three entrees and i sampled all of them .
was it cooked or was n't it ?
another huge disappointment .
the only thing good about this place was nothing .
never going back .
by far the worst dining experience i have ever had .
i have never been treated more rudely .
when our food came out , everything looked fine except for the ravioli .
there were literally _num_ pieces of ravioli on one plate .
_num_ small pieces of ravioli for $ _num_ .
that 's not enough food for one person .
she does n't care about customer service .
i guess i will stick with grimaldi 's that 's right down the road .
the food was n't even good enough for the prices you are charged .
i 've had better food at olive garden , and that 's sad .
i 'm in total shock .
he had two girls bang in the door .
he was very rude and i would never go back .
i would have called the police but i was visiting my very ill brother .
we spent _num_ dollars and this is how he treats his customers .
this place made my stomach flip !
i have never felt more offended in my life .
so i filled up on bread , which was good .
insulting , dishonest and bottom line an absolute joke !
we had a mediocre dinner tonight .
i have been here before but after tonight , we wo n't be returning .
the waiter apparently did n't like the tip our host gave him .
we ordered and the service was ok as to what happened afterwards .
what we got was way worse .
he tried to make it seem like we were being kicked out !
unbelievable dont go here !
nothing crazy , just a simple dinner and a group of seven girls .
he then proceeded to clear all of our drinks off the table .
the food is terrible and the service is even worse .
never have i been treated so badly by an owner of a restaurant .
he treats his staff just as poorly .
he should be ashamed and embarrassed .
do not go to this restaurant .
what a huge waste of money .
all the negative reviews were correct !
owner is rude , and loud .
if i rated the italian food from 1-10 , it might get a _num_ .
i could not wait to get out of there .
we were a party of _num_ on sunday night at 5:00 .
just not worth it .
the host was an old italian man who was very very rude .
this place honestly does n't understand the concept of service .
weird , we though .
next , a server comes up to use the credit card machine .
so you are n't my problem . ''
who are visiting from southern california .
we walked in and the place was empty .
the waiters that said that he could not do that .
chances are we would n't return to italian grotto .
if i pay you $ _num_ .
stupid !
the staff was so rude to us .
horribly rude and unprofessional .
i 've never had anyone be so disrespectful at a restaurant to me .
_num_ $ _num_ pastas cost us $ _num_ .
as i overheard .
fail .
$ _num_ ] this place was a huge disappointment for my wife and self .
the service was decent but unfortunately the food was served cold and undercooked .
i struggled to find anything i liked about our dining experience here .
the location and the outside dining are about the only positives i can highlight .
the waiter was far from personable and made us feel guilty for asking anything .
so disappointed .
i then approached him after to address is lack of professionalism .
he refused to further address the situation .
i do not suggest going to this place .
portions are really small for a $ _num_ plate .
the spaghetti and meatballs tasted extremely bland .
the only thing i liked was the little romaine salad with the italian dressing .
after _num_ minutes , we were finally seated .
overall , would not recommend anyone coming here .
it was tough and just very unappealing .
police came but were not allowed in .
about three weeks later my place was broken into .
food was terrible and the staff was very rude .
please do not waste your time or money .
for the price of the food , i expected it to be hot .
our food was average , tasted like what you can make at home .
not worth the money .
fried artichokes were alright but pricy for what it is .
the food was ok to bad , and the staff was very rude .
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
next on plate was the fettuccine alfredo pasta .
do not go to this restaurant !
honestly , people should be warned about this place !
we arrive on time - no tables were available .
my dad politely explained that we had made a reservation .
we asked how long the wait was and he estimated maybe _num_ minutes .
avoid !
he threatened to kick me out for saying order up .
avoid this location at all costs .
we sat down and our table was n't even clean .
there was salt all over it and crumbs .
disappointment .
i wish it was possible to give this place negative stars .
by no means should customers by treated in this manner .
in all , you are warned !
this is possibly the worst restaurant i have ever been in .
we had _num_ people and _num_ of them ordered the chicken ceasar salads .
the salad had a horrible fish smell and tasted even worst .
that should tell you how bad it was .
there was no acknowledgement during our visit .
i have never had a worse restaurant experience than at this place .
it was absolutely terrible .
there is something very wrong with the food this place serves .
_num_ ) the owner and the servers are jerks .
_num_ ) we didnt even get our salads or soups .
i do n't care if everyone in your party has n't arrived .
you should still be seated with a reservation before walk ins .
this has been a must stop for years but no longer .
murphy , at the bar did n't .
totally overrated .
got half of a sliced up chicken breast .
waiter was arrogant .
so gross .
the owner was over the top , absolutely rude .
without saying a word we all walked out .
customer service was not so good .
he was rude and it nearly ruined my dining experience .
very poor individual to represent a business .
do n't waste your money here .
i would certainly never come back to this place ever again .
i 'm thinking , you do n't recognize me ?
so the sad thing is , we are n't even tourists , were locals .
we were handed paper menus with food stains and torn edges .
the prices were ridiculous .
the short , greasy guy with long hair does not speak english !
the bread was store bought cold and tasted _num_ days old .
i will not go here again .
not a place i will go back !
terrible experience !
extremely bad karma for charming old town scottsdale !
price was $ _num_ , times two , since we both ordered this .
minestrone soup was mediocre .
$ _num_ , folks .
( this includes $ _num_ for two vodka martinis , btw . )
all these people ca n't be that wrong !
terrible !
luckily i did n't stay and only paid for an overpriced beverage .
was n't very impressed .
we also ordered fish that was way over cooked .
rude and unprofessional , food actually was very good but the server was not .
how this place remains open is beyond me .
i asked for linguine & clam sauce and a fettuccine alfredo .
he then offered me fettuccine & an order of spaghetti & meatballs .
no utensils , no napkins , no bread .
a salad drenched in olive oil and no vinegar .
avoid at all costs , .
one star is too much can you post negative stars ?
horrible !
do not give a penny to this establishment !
i can not believe how this place is still in business .
we were a party of _num_ and my husband 's entree was delivered incorrectly .
brandon was so obnoxious and defensive and denied getting the order wrong .
i could not believe that so many others had the same experience .
so awful !
he answered , `` you wo n't get in anywhere , i recommend nothing .
she explained that saturdays are busy and she tried to smooth everything over .
italian grotto sucks !
no one seemed to notice or care .
again super awkward and we just wanted to get the heck outta there .
terrible service !
i 'm giving this place one star because i can not give it zero .
the most dreadful service i have ever received .
the waiter was ridiculously rude .
( which was dreadful ) .
garlic bread : flavorless ( how is that possible ? )
all in all , do n't waste your time .
he is as rude and arrogant as others have mentioned .
he was out of steak .
the soup and garlic toast were tasteless .
the soup was lukewarm as if it had been sitting out .
but fuck , they should probably be out of business .
worst italian place ever .
it was like almost never ending .
to top it off the food was bland and clearly not fresh .
the food is extremely sub par .
the rest of it is bland .
terrible experience .
do n't recommend .
very disappointed !
our party of eight was crammed into a small table .
when the food finally arrived it 's was bland and tasted stale .
do n't waste your time here !
will never go back to this tourist trap and never recommend it to anyone .
bottom line it was _num_ hours of my life i just wasted .
this place sucked !
should have read the reviews before i went to this shit hole .
worst restaurant in old town !
his food and moral demeanor are unacceptable .
this place is the worst !
shame on the grotto !
unfortunately , the poor reviews were being very kind .
the food was beyond bad .
i am vegetarian so i ordered the spaghetti marinara .
zero flavor , zero effort .
my salad was equally terrible .
iceberg lettuce topped with about a pound of blue cheese dressing .
the calamari was breaded and fried and had no seasoning , including salt .
feeling ripped off .
probably the worst service and food i 've ever had !
the worse service we ever had .
whoever reads the reviews on this restaurant do not go there .
long story short we were celebrating a birthday .
there was _num_ of us .
the waiter was so rude .
the manager was horrible .
she looked like she just rolled out of bed .
it was disgusting .
i ca n't believe they are still in business .
we got thrown out of the restaurant .
i wo n't even give them _num_ star .
do not go to this place !
the employees were n't even doing anything wrong .
very gross !
this place has been open for _num_ years with the same owner , wtf !
so we were walking north and walked by italian grotto .
i wish we did n't eat here .
the ambience was very dark and smelled of sanitation .
the food was terrible .
the minestrone soup tastes like leather .
the pasta noodles were fine however , the quality did not match the price .
food was decent , way overpriced for the size of the portion .
the food was n't terrible .
a little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion .
server was a bit pushy , but i would n't say rude .
$ _num_ per cannoli and the filling tasted like vanilla pudding , not cheese .
mcdonald 's would have been better .
awful , terrible , disgusting !
i only wish she had called me before choosing this restaurant .
this place is horrible !
it was not filling , not good and extremely overpriced .
we ended up paying $ _num_ for _num_ entrees .
i had been wanting to try this place forever .
all in all , i would not return ... ever .
service stinks .
then they threw away about _num_ of the new ones we took in !
always an awkward and rude interaction at this place .
shame .
do n't get me wrong , i love guess clothes .
so rude and condescending .
that was a big no no !
but it mostly disappeared , so it must of been okay .
and their slow songs were boring me .
karaoke on tuesday and thursday and saturday night rocks !
food selection is extremely limited !
bathrooms are a mess .
the nachos were not really nachos .
it was stiff , so that is good .
this place was just really meh .
as soon as we sat down , a woman started singing .
that 's not why i 'm giving this _num_ starts .
we were there a good _num_ minutes total , and never saw a server .
more beer might have saved the situation , in some way .
the service was so slow i got irritated .
i felt ignored by the hostess and waitress i will not be going back .
_num_ stars rounded down .
there was some heavy duty karaoke action going on in the bar .
this place sucks .
there are so many better places in old town than this hell hole .
do n't bother with this place for karaoke .
if you are looking for below average cuisine , this is your place .
this was realized after the meal was over , making my stomach turn .
was disappointing to end up here with mediocre food and service .
another _num_ minutes had gone by and we had not seen our waitress .
no one in the place noticed we left or even cared .
this place is horrible !
_num_ minutes after that the single beer my dad ordered came .
wrong !
it was almost _num_ o'clock before our food came !
my dad 's salad was just as disappointing .
this place sucks a $ $ !
it was seriously dirty from the menus , the floor to the tables .
not a big deal to me , but it could bother some people .
when we did get the food the serving sizes could not have been bigger !
ick .
overall it was a negative dining and drinking experience .
save yourself an unpleasant eating and drinking experience and avoid this place .
there are too many negatives to even consider giving this place a second chance .
service was quite bad .
very loud atmosphere .
more of a type of place you would find in the southwest valley .
was not a regular , but dang .
tonight was my last meal .
this restaurant needs new management .
when we did get seated , the waitress was even more clueless .
i now see that this slow service runs through all the yelp reviews .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
too broad a choice for most chefs , and this one was no different .
the rest of the food was very mediocre and room temperature .
i do agree with her it was rather awful .
the waitress was beyond rude and unhelpful .
no karaoke was going on , so there was no reason to come here !
unless you want to do karaoke at night , do not eat here .
it was n't terrible , but definitely not fresh or spectacular in any way .
the chili or whatever was on my taco salad was down right gross .
i must admit that service every time i dine , is slow at best .
as it stands , it 's only ok at best .
my experience here was so disappointing .
and most of the bar has already cleared out .
also , watch your drinks .
if you 're looking for a good karaoke bar , i recommend looking elsewhere .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
seriously - she was awful .
it was clear that she could n't have cared less that we were there .
we did n't have a server acknowledge us for about _num_ minutes .
it was then another lengthy wait to bet our food .
the food was lacking as well .
the other one would be italian grotto .
grilled cheese that wasnt melted .
soggy bread on all the sandwiches .
my advise your better off going to dennys .
however that is where all the good ends .
we got two meals delivered and then nothing , the server just left .
... and it was awful .
overall , not a great experience and we wo n't be back .
the table was not wiped , and had crusty dried food spots on it .
the server was surly , no smile , no thank you .
however , this place really needs new bartenders .
there was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted .
she reluctantly gave it back .
it takes this much for me to not tip someone .
this was literally the worst service i have ever had .
horrible place to karaoke and food.
do n't waste your time.
spend your time and $ $ elsewhere .
do not go here for karaoke .
not one persons name was ever called .
wait to be disappointed .
it 's so weird .
this bar does n't need you .
_num_ songs , and you 're not going to get called .
lazy dj .
but they do n't need you , so do n't go .
we really came for the karaoke , but we were terribly disappointed .
karaoke is completely biased to regulars .
i got there at 8pm with an empty bar and requested _num_ songs .
i did n't get on til 11pm .
tried to talk to the dj about it and he ignore me .
i was disappointed with the opportunity to sing .
okay , that is one star too many .
we sat for _num_ hours and never did get called .
stay away from this place unless you are friends with the karaoke mc .
the food at this place sucks , their bartenders suck .
and the karaoke is terrible .
horrible !
no stage area due to size .
ridiculous !
bottom line i would never go here again !
and their website says , `` arizona 's karaoke place . ''
how depressing , poor representation of the state .
people , you 've been warned !
it took nearly _num_ hours to have a chance to sing .
restaurant was nearly empty .
anyway we ordered food it was bland .
all the food lacked seasoning .
proceed with caution .
_num_ stars for ambiance .
food was cold and the service was subpar .
service at this place is terrible .
i was fairly wet before i ever saw my food .
unfortunately , it looks like it .
the restroom was a mess .
she clearly showed no concern .
not great especially for homemade , but not bad .
too bad it was a bad experience .
i was here several years ago and it was much better .
_num_ . )
i ordered potato skins sans bacon and fried shrimp .
bad !
also , this was some of the worst service i have ever experienced .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
unfortunately mine was the most severe .
um ... its _num_ outside .
food was horrible and outdated .
our server tiffany was super nice but this place sucks .
worst experience of my life .
no one else was able to sing karaoke due to the long wait time .
the place was absolutely filthy and decor is outdated .
they had a discounted entrance fee of $ _num_ and only one exhibit open !
there really was n't anything all that special there on my trip .
my daughter is nine and already very serious about her art .
photos were a bit disturbing , but not in a good way .
small ... my apartment must be a museum too then .
_num_ % off book sale .
we were more disappointed that they only had _num_ exhibits open .
i have never been so dissapointed with the service at a restaurant before .
i have never been rushed out of a restaurant so quickly .
at one point even stopping a cook .
the food was ehh and no i would not go back .
still , it 's not worth the wait , or really any wait .
overall , i ca n't see any reason why i 'd eat here again .
it 's definitely not worth $ _num_ .
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
the chicken is a healthy choice , but smells better than it tastes .
we told them , half the tables are empty .
then , the servers kept trying to rush us .
when our friend got there , the server kept trying to take our order .
we got the cornbread , but kept getting rushed to order .
it was an unpleasant dinner .
then , they kept trying to rush us out .
if you want to enjoy a reasonable dinner , i 'd find someplace else .
they feel mashed potatoes are a garnish for the steak or fish .
i wo n't be back .
what a shame !
extremely disappointed !
my husband offered to pay for an extra meal , but we were refused .
not by word of mouth and certainly not by any reviews i have read .
this was pretty rude .
they have mesquite broiled chicken , salads , ribs and other items .
it had goat cheese , chicken and all the fixings .
my recommendation is to skip this place unless its a last resort .
as soon as we finished dessert , our water glasses and napkins were removed .
they then put an automatic _num_ % tip for a party of six .
no apology , nothing .
poor customer service .
not accommodating and would n't seat more than _num_ .
he was very rude and condescending .
on a last attempt our card went through .
no apology .
no attempt to make it right .
not even a cup of coffee !
went next door for ice cream and the card was fine !
a new manager is desperately needed !
unfortunately , this was quite disappointing .
it did n't get finished .
the pie itself had none .
this place , staff , management and corporate do n't deserve any starts !
my chicken was bland and red in the middle and my rice was cold .
they did n't tell us that when they served it to us .
so my friend went to talk to the manager , nick .
extremely upsetting dinner .
turns out he was n't .
then very quickly we got our artichoke .
it only gets worse .
she was very obviously annoyed by a late table .
very obviously annoyed .
no apology about the rush or no more beer just a snotty attitude .
epic failure !
you lost customers .
you lost profit .
you lost big money ; big scottsdale money .
the service was terrible .
she said `` im _num_ % sure i gave it back to you '' .
i 'm `` _num_ % sure '' she wont be getting a tip ... .
it ruined the whole experience .
denied service because our party of _num_ is too big ?
they ca n't sit parties larger than _num_ .
this used to be one of our favorite places .
would n't go back !
three of us ordered the rotisserie chicken and ribs .
once i bit into them , i wished i had n't tasted them .
( _num_ minutes later i catch her walking by . )
maybe this whole `` white upper class '' dining experience is n't for me .
we probably should 've just left and spent our money elsewhere .
however , last night we left so disappointed in our meals and the service .
and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant .
$ _num_ plus a plate and we wrap our own leftovers ?
bandera , you 've lost one of your biggest fans .
overpriced and not a genuine steakhouse .
my filet was undercooked and a bit bland .
the bone-in ribeye was much better .
_num_ for a glass of wine was overpriced .
really disappointed for the price .
i 'm just not into the hype ... .
i would stick w appetizers and sandwiches .
they are all way too heavy .
i really miss the grilled lamb sirloin .
management is terrible .
i 'd even go to buca de beppo across the street over this place .
the service was horrible .
our waitress was rude and she could barely be bothered to take out order .
she did not make eye contact with us once .
what another disappointment .
the chicken was dry and cold and the ribs were overcooked .
i asked for a manager , and she too refused to sell them .
she refused .
fries wo n't get a review but the poor service will .
would not recommend this place to anyone .
i then walked to the restaurant and put my name in .
even after over _num_ minutes already waiting .
and walked out to buy him one .
she apologized and gave me the contact information to the collection agency .
i left a message and he returned my call promptly .
so whose fault is it again ?
rush stated several times that i needed to follow up with my insurance company .
they claim they accept insurance , then they do n't .
really just a horrible experience .
only writing my review now since i 'm was n't familiar with yelp .
a teacher walked by and she told her what was happening .
my cut took so long , that the school was about to close .
i had a long layer in the back and i was mortified !
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
it 's hair and it will grow back , but this just plain sucked !
sometimes places need to die ( just like we all do someday ) .
the long anticipated review of chances are .
it 's horrible .
no surprises here fellow yelpers .
so we sit down for dinner -- and order drinks .
i could n't drink it .
and i like two buck chuck !
absolutely _num_ % old people food .
i went there for my moms birthday , and we brought a coupon .
( no ) .
the ribs were not baby back , they were beef ?
i wo n't go back .
it 's a bar surrounded by tables on an ugly concrete floor .
they were very basic and nothing special .
it 's not .
bad .
place was dead .
ordered _num_ domestic drafts , laid down a $ _num_ .
got $ _num_ back in change .
$ _num_ for a draft ?
he did give us $ _num_ back , and he was friendly .
still think $ _num_ domestic drafts for this place unreasonable .
even if they do n't leave , who cares ?
the other time a rather lame duo band sang over tracks .
the beer selection is pitiful .
maybe the worst i ever experienced !
if chances wants to attract a younger crowd they really have to do better .
a bottle of fat tire really should n't be asking for too much .
def wo n't be back for $ _num_ i have found much better places .
disappointment .
this is the worst state farm i have been with .
i talked very clearly i just one year and she said she understood .
she suggested that i can pay month by month hot this year .
her attitude just just just made me disgusting .
i do not recommend people go to that state farm .
it 's the worst state farm i have been to .
is it better than being late ?
i 'm not so sure it is .
now he just waits in our driveway until i get home .
boring .
any time there 's a new song , i never hear it ever again .
and the coffee just is not that good .
so there goes my `` shop local '' thing .
my bad , not theirs .
and , second , this place sucks .
my chai latte was pale and very close to the hue of milk .
and the cappuccino was bad .
yes , bad .
the espresso was way too hot .
the espresso to milk ratio was way off as well .
the atmosphere is boring and generic .
i have no idea how this place has a four star rating .
eh ?
the coffee turned out to be very weak .
i 'm not going back .
my hotel room coffee has more bite .
why ca n't starbucks do that ?
just my _num_ cents .
terrible experience at this starbucks store the few times i have visited .
the last one was the absolute worst .
i ca n't believe that no one else has complained about this location before .
there is absolutely no sense of urgency here .
there seems to be constant turnover in staff .
one barista was friendly though or else i would 've just walked on out .
i went for a cleaning , nothing more .
six months later i get a bill for $ _num_ .
i received a bill for _num_ dollars .
they are nine west boots , worn one season .
i waited _num_ minutes .
the boots were `` spray painted '' not repaired .
should n't that already be done ?
also , the price i paid was $ _num_ more then i was quoted .
ridiculous prices and crappy work .
would try to fix shoes myself before ever returning to your shop !
by the way , the price of this shoddy work ?
nothing special .
the food i thought was too greasy and its definitely not an authentic place .
ugh , this place is terrible !
i seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right .
its salty and very flavorful , but somehow it just tastes off .
i 've tried a lot of dishes here too .
terrible .
it does n't and your marketing sucks .
and it is for sure an `` american '' chinese hang out .
however , the food ... .
it 's like licking a salt lick ... .
ugh what happened to this place ?
crab puffs i would n't even give to the dog .
dan dan noodles had no taste .
horrible service !
when i asked for the manager i was hung up on .
my replacement meal was of the normally expected quality .
my friend that went with me said his meal sucked too .
many fast food places have a reputation of messing w/ cops orders .
forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once , shame on you .
forget them twice , shame on me .
the third time and pei wei is officially dead to me .
unacceptable .
epic fail for this pei wei .
wish the employees were more cautious where they stuff their face .
but all in all , was n't a deal breaker .
i thought this was awful and the cashier was a unfriendly .
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
other than that no discount , no consideration .
i 'm sitting here now waiting patiently for my order .
i feel sorry for the young employee working the register .
i wish they had better management , because the food itself is decent .
i wish they had better management , because the food itself is decent .
it 's a tuesday night and the place is totally empty .
we really feel it 's gone down hill .
thumbs down .
not sure we will come back .
i do n't have time to wait .
where 's my refund for you getting my order wrong ?
condescending arrogant staff , know your job .
do n't waste your time or money at this place .
can we please get some better management in here ?
first timer over at the pei wei .
ugh , this place is just terrible .
this place is really trying to be upscale , but it 's not .
they were overcooked and the seared spices were a soggy mess .
the sauce added nothing to the fish .
mozzarella was obviously a costco purchase ( not bad though ) .
looking for a romantic dining experience with below average food ?
but as we were being seated , we noticed the restaurant was almost empty .
not a good sign .
when we asked to see the prix fixe menu , he seemed annoyed .
i also asked for an ice tea refill , which never came .
i had the pork chop and it was awful .
i regret that decision .
portions are not large ( which was perfect for us ) .
very disappointing .
very nice view but very slow service and unacceptable food .
it was very thin and tough .
and the sonoran potatoes ... omg , delish .
terrible service .
for convenience staying at the hotel ... just go have breakfast .
as to the food , it is hit and miss .
waters were already served when we sat down .
we ordered flat iron steak medium rare with over easy eggs .
what we got was the total opposite .
another mediocre eating experience .
- _num_ star - greeting at door .
+ _num_ star - server .
- _num_ star - decor .
a bit confused , imo .
_num_ star - the food .
not good .
ick .
just not good .
not inedible , but not worth eating and especially not for $ _num_ .
i would not eat here again .
this was just not worth it .
i can not recommend this restaurant .
the decor makes absolutely no sense .
maybe winter just was n't my season .
no entrees excited me and the desserts were extremely strange .
there is no way i would eat here again .
ridiculous !
oh , and $ _num_ for vodka on ice , with olives !
so disappointed because we enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff .
my wife and i used to eat here regularly .
just so-so and very salty .
not child friendly !
we went to dinner tonight as a request from my _num_ year old .
instead of helping out and bringing bread to suffice a child .
the food was mediocre at best .
the pesto was nothing more than chopped mint .
i do not recommend this restaurant .
there are better places here in arizona that actually care .
i actually could n't get the hell out of there fast enough .
the place is busy on wednesdays and fridays .
so my tab came and the total was _num_ !
the bartender was really really rude the whole time and kept yelling at me .
i had such a terrible night after that happened .
dirty and low brow ... .
i ca n't even pretend to dig this scene .
pretty terrible and annoying experience overall .
what 's to say , this place is a low class hangout .
i still am not impressed .
i only had my credit cards ( who does not take credit anymore ) .
i wo n't be back again ate being told to leave .
yeah i did n't really like this bar .
the bouncer was mean to me .
never ever come to this shitty ass racist white trash bar .
no one friendly or legit .
fake biker bar .
it did n't matter , though .
tiny scottsdale women who barely have a bump ?
i managed to find _num_ shirts at ok prices .
did i mention all the moldy pitas in the bread section ?
oh , bought wine , um the $ _num_ kind - it was off !
_num_ % or more less at phoenix wine .
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
i was absolutely wrong .
the two gentleman working the meat counter had less meat knowledge than i did .
it was the most disgusting piece of carrot cake i have ever ate .
the meal was around $ _num_ for _num_ people .
however , the meal was absolutely tasteless .
the turkey had absolutely no taste at all .
the pie for desert was okay .
staff is on the rude side and place is not organized .
a shame , if they fix it i 'll improve my rating .
this is usually my favorite steak house for the money .
went for lunch today , big mistake .
fries were cold and beef dip dry however wifey enjoyed the salad .
where 's the keg i 'm used to ?
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
all three of us ordered the lobster and shrimp summer salad .
big disappointment .
my companions felt it was n't really lobster .
the shrimp was n't that good , either .
if this had been our first visit , we would not return .
suggest if this is the best they can do , _num_ the salad .
went to the keg last night for our anniversary .
hers was ok , a little too rare .
not just a little fat , this was gristle .
we went for the steak and were highly disappointed .
unfortunately , i was sorely disappointed .
it 's like the restaurant does n't know what it wants to be .
bad choice .
boy was i wrong again .
i hate to say this , but save yourself the trouble .
let me start by saying , i did n't pay for my meal .
turns out they do not .
they only have _num_ taps and _num_ of those are bud .
it was also very loud .
that was weird .
the starting prices of steaks here are $ _num_ just for the meat .
bad experience .
do yourself a favor and skip this place .
when the prime rib arrived i could not believe my eyes .
it was an awful grey color .
i took one bite and could not eat any more .
the flavorless meat was so tough that it hurt my teeth .
it took _num_ minutes to get the waiter 's attention .
unbelievable .
our dinner with our friends was a total disaster .
my first experience at keg steakhouse and bar was super disappointing ... .
not looking so good here , we should have left .
the meal was pretty pricey ( $ _num_ ) , and we left disappointed !
i expected better service and better food for the money .
i will not be back and wish i would have gone to longhorn steakhouse .
service terrible .
will not be returning anytime soon .
party of _num_ went on a thursday night .
service was good , but food was very slow .
i do n't get it .
the garlic toast is greasy and kid food .
the bacon wrapped scallops are laughable in size , presentation and taste .
the steaks are grocery store quality .
what 's the big deal about a twice baked potato ?
nothing special .
nothing at all .
i have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years .
was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked .
it was like complete rubber .
it was barely edible .
very disappointing .
i will never go here again , and will advise others to avoid .
basically saying it wo n't help to ask .
the entree 's do not include a salad .
my entre was $ _num_ .
drinks are cheaper too .
huge disappointment and ended any return visit .
two new york manhattan cut steaks and a prime rib .
all steaks were over cooked with one side somehow missing the grill completely .
i actually felt bad for the waitresses .
it appears they are required to wear extremely short & tight fitting clothes .
sorry waitresses : - ( i was almost embarrassed for you .
all else was greatly disappointing .
horrible presentation for the price .
sorry , keg - wo n't be back .
low and behold , our food arrives and neither steak is correct .
so now my husband is eating and i 'm not .
bad start .
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
just a very disappointing visit and lackluster serving from the keg at desert ridge .
... then they charged another tables bill and our bill to our card .
buy they did n't seem to care about the inconvenience of it all .
i dunno if i 'll go back or not .
oh so sad to eat nothing for my birthday dinner !
seared ahi appetizer was ok ... i have had far better .
way too much avocado on the plate with a somewhat stingy helping of ahi .
i ordered prime rib ... that , was a big mistake .
a second one delivered was as bad .
just a total waste of time energy and money .
zero stars not accepted , sadly as that is , my rating .
disappointing .
i wo n't be going back .
i had the teriyaki sirloin , but there was nothing teriyaki about it .
i could n't even tell if the meat had been marinated in sauce .
the meat lacked flavor and was incredibly bland .
with that being said , i ca n't complain about the service .
waited another _num_ for the glass of wine .
server said sorry every time she stopped by and said where 's your wine ?
really is that who you want to run your restaurant ?
then just fyi , only took off one wine cause i waited .
very average pizza .
just did n't care for it too much .
they really did n't give a crap about all the pissed off customers .
yucky !
we tried pepperoni and one with chicken it 's probably cafeteria quality .
i tried rosati 's next door and it was far better for the price .
but there are so many flies in the restaurant it 's almost unbearable .
would be _num_ stars if not for the gross pest problem .
this place has very bad customer service !
i do n't understand why businesses treat their customers that way for delivery .
do n't bother coming here .
management is poor , and i will be filing complaint with az health dept .
they were completely dry all the way through .
i like a little crunch , but come on , not the meat !
they were quite disgusting .
i threw most of them into the garbage .
sorry barro 's , you blew it tonight .
i did not take one bite because it was cold .
an incorrect meal was delivered stone cold and incorrect .
if not , we ca n't help you . ''
but the attitude of the girl on the phone was extremely rude .
wo n't be returning .
but , let me start with some positives .
_num_ bars , if on the slow side .
so if everything is pretty adequate , what drove down the rating ?
but fortunately , the staff took care of that quickly .
not even worth a free stay next time .
ii mean every _num_ inches .
the office chair upholstery is pretty nasty as well .
slightly below room temp is all your getting out of their current appliance .
but the cleanliness is seriously , seriously lacking .
nasty motel .
nasty motel .
now the room was a disaster .
there was wall covering splitting and much of it looked dated and warn .
the bed sucked .
the plumbing in the walls was very loud .
if you value your sleep find another hotel .
sorry , not that good .
tv , bathroom , all that stuff , average .
beds are alright , but seriously , that sheet ruined the stay for me .
they are dishonest !
do not drop your clothes off here , donate them to charity .
i was not impressed at all .
if i could change the name i would call it my mother 's closet .
a lot of the stuff was extremely used and very overpriced .
the ladies that work there were old and not very friendly .
my mother would like it there but i found everything kind of ugly .
i would n't even give the store a second chance .
an employee even insulted me to my face as i walked out the door .
i could n't believe it !
why on earth would n't a manager let customers know _num_ minutes before close ?
a loud speaker would have been a good idea .
i did n't end up with much .
some of these were designer pieces .
on the clothing now that i do n't even go into look .
she was very rude and the customer service was horrid .
too many better stores out there .
when i complained to the owner she was rude and angry .
she told me i am not allowed back to her store .
they are very dishonest .
why , oh why are they so condescending ?
i urge you to take a stand , shop someplace else .
first visit - dressed down .
no service !
this time was even worse .
i was offered no greeting at all .
not _num_ feet behind me followed a second customer , all dressed up .
what am i , chopped liver ?
i just ca n't take being treated so poorly .
you can not judge people based on appearance .
they charge you to take out cash , and give you less cash !
this is something that everyone who loves designer bags needs to know .
i was turned down but offered a $ _num_ gift card for the store .
this is where things get interesting .
in other words it 's a fake !
i spent $ _num_ on a fake chanel bag .
zero stars !
this place would have received more stars had i not had unpleasant experiences .
every now and then , i have to raise an eyebrow .
dishonest tactics have led me to sell higher quality items elsewhere .
the retail was $ _num_ .
it sold in zero days and i got $ _num_ for it .
so my brand new pair sold in zero days and i got $ _num_ .
otherwise , items are hit and miss .
they said it is not something they want and it was outdated .
terrible !
terrible !
north scottsdale location is terrible !
my goodness , was she an unpleasant woman !
was she too busy sitting on her butt in the back ?
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
whoever the owners are really needs to read all of these reviews .
terrible customer service .
lots of clothing in poor condition .
granted these were fairly minimal and normally i would have bought the top regardless .
however due to their complete lack of customer service i decided to pass .
i consistently find the staff here to lack any type of customer service skills .
they are a used clothing store , and _num_ .
maybe i am a snob , but this place was just like a goodwill .
it smells awful , old and stale in the here .
the one i want is $ _num_ .
i was thinking maybe i could find one here .
i dropped off high end , men 's clothing .
disappointing customer service .
just lost a customer for life .
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
i never received any response which i think is pretty crap business .
this is the only bad experience i have had here out of several visits .
not good customer service .
especially after _num_ years and thousands of dollars of business they got from me .
she has no personality and talks to her patients in a condescending way .
i would not recommend this dr. or this facility !
run , do n't walk away !
i am only _num_ years old !
why did you let this disease advance to my feet in the first place ?
i am _num_ times worse than when i first starting going to this facility .
if there was a negative star , that 's what this facility would get !
i am glad i di not get any appointment with this group .
and i just can not believe it it is outrageous .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
i made an appointment that was about _num_ weeks out .
the receptionist could n't give me a reason for the delay ?
she is _num_ years old for god 's sake .
very rude over the phone when i tried scheduling an appointment .
annoying .
the woman who checked me in wasnt very understanding .
if possible , i would n't choose this medical image facility .
i can not understand why there is no manager who can fix this .
this is not during holidays , it is an everyday thing .
customer service is mediocre at best .
the doctor was fine , the front office he had was incompetent .
there were n't any tables available .
it was super awkward .
the outside of the venue was nice but the inside was awful .
they have informed me to avoid this school as much as possible .
if you are looking at high schools in northern scottsdale avoid this one .
this school is terrible .
they have a pretty bad sports program and they have a terrible student section .
they have a terrible educational program .
very arrogant attitude and i learned my lesson the hard way .
in arizona in july , this is not a good thing .
it does n't seem they care much what happens after they have your money .
however , the build process and warranty work did not meet our expectations .
ultimately , the expected quality for the price paid just is n't there .
when buying a home , you have a choice .
this meant they cut corners , and will not stand by their mistakes .
it becomes a fight with the subs .
no pride in workmanship and no pride in selling an as advertised product .
one of the worst customer service and bad attitudes i 've ever experienced .
the owner is very unfriendly .
the wine selection is average and over-priced .
the are hundreds of better wine stores nearby .
probably the worst customer service that i have ever experienced .
owner was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
the was the worst maintained course i 've played on , maybe ever .
i wo n't go back and i will tell people to avoid .
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
i guess we should have actually looked at course before we paid .
since it was a business outing we were kind of stuck .
it was a goat patch .
major disappointment .
totally boring .
if i go back i might try the thai salad or something different .
this is simply not a good place to feed a hungry family .
pizza kitchen so was n't sure what to expect .
i do not think we will be visiting this restaurant again anytime soon .
walked across the street from the hampton inn .
convenient but wo n't go back .
i guess that was my fault .
it was doughy and undercooked with no flavor .
if i go to any cpk again i wo n't order that .
he pours them out and one comes up very short .
i stared at him and shook my head and he ignored me .
the food is mediocre and you should not order any drinks from here .
so , i drank it anyways because i am not the arguing type .
the pizza was n't on a thin crust .
all in all , disappointing .
disgusting .
unfriendly the entire time so asked to speak to the manager .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
what a waste .
bad food bad service .
would i visit there again ?
not a very sanitary vision .
probably was thankful that we turned around and walked out the door .
i got home to find _num_ bowls of pea and barley soup .
needless to say she did n't eat it .
not impressed .
the server was attentive which was nice .
the food , however , was not up to usual cpk standards .
the bianco flatbread had hardly any toppings on it .
service was slow and i felt like an inconvenience .
it was n't even cooked and all the veggies were in a separate container .
it went straight to the trash can .
so disappointed .
wo n't be back .
i would avoid it unless this is the atmosphere you prefer .
but in my opinion there should be no wrong items on a menu .
this place is ridiculous .
moreover , the wine list was terrible .
elements just does n't match up .
the wait staff is cold and at times near rude .
it was way over-cooked and not really spicy .
in fear , i quickly tried the shrimp .
however , as a complete dish it was an utter failure .
i 'll go out and spend $ _num_ on dinner for myself .
in fact , i consistently get better food and service at red robin .
it was our second time , our first visit being over _num_ years ago .
well , unfortunately everything else .
my husband had the short ribs and again , bland .
once again , disappointed .
so not good .
but other than that , so off the mark .
for instance , my salad was swimming in vinaigrette .
so sour !
that 's a denny 's mistake .
the food was ok , nothing special .
server did n't know much about the food either .
all in all , we wo n't be going back there any time soon .
too bad , too , it has a great view .
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
the service was horrible .
we waited over _num_ minutes to have our order taken .
the table was left full of dishes the entire time .
the waiter never came back , never offered coffee , dessert or anything .
we left and will not be back .
scottsdale has too many other restaurants that want our money .
my husband and i looked forward to celebrating our anniversary at elements .
totally disappointing !
we will not return .
the food was unfortunately a huge disappointment .
trader joe 's frozen teriyaki chicken breasts are far superior .
potato chips were not anything special .
another disappointment .
the setting , looking down over the valley from camelback mountain , beautiful .
the food was lousy .
it may be because we ate late for phoenix ( arrived at 9:00 ) .
it may be because we ordered badly .
my husband and i went to dinner tonight , we were very disappointed !
not one good thing to say about the whole experience .
just a thought .
server did n't seem well groomed and needed to brush his teeth .
very very disappointing .
the tuna tartare at $ _num_ was okay but not very flavorful .
i had ordered the scallops entree which at $ _num_ was quite disappointing .
are you kidding me ?
in any restaurant the food should be number _num_ .
very little pretentious , just friendly and helpful staff .
it was terrible , simply awful .
i should have sent it back , i am upset that i did n't .
next time i wo n't be so shy about returning bad food .
i rarely write a review , but i feel in this case i must .
however , the few minutes turned into _num_ minutes .
this is unacceptable considering we did have a reservation !
_num_ - _num_ minutes i can understand , _num_ minutes , not really .
extremely disappointing .
i wrote it there , saw it and then it suddenly disappeared today .
i rarely write a review , but i feel in this case i must .
however , the few minutes turned into _num_ minutes .
this is unacceptable considering we did have a reservation !
_num_ - _num_ minutes i can understand , _num_ minutes , not really .
extremely disappointing .
i rarely write a review , but i feel in this case i must .
however , the few minutes turned into _num_ minutes .
this is unacceptable considering we did have a reservation !
_num_ - _num_ minutes i can understand , _num_ minutes , not really .
extremely disappointing .
in a word , pathetic .
i can only comment on the brunch they presented on sunday .
seems like whatever was left in the kitchen over the weekend turns into brunch .
it was very bad experience .
staff was not friendly .
this was a disappointment .
the food was nothing special .
i would not eat there again , i 'm not that picky .
i actually makes me sad to leave this review .
the state of restaurants in phoenix is pathetic .
was actually somewhat disappointed with our experience here .
i suggest management train their staff and get rid of ones with attitude .
unfortunately we were not happy .
the presentation was even a bit sloppy .
the price was more than half less and our experience was so much better .
we are all so disappointed and expected so much more from elements .
the view did not disappoint .
our server came across rude and uninterested .
the majority of us ordered the short ribs and not one person was impressed .
very disappointing food and service on a very special night .
the dinner turned out to be horrible !
three of us ordered sea bass ( approx .
$ _num_ ) .
the sea bass was dry and felt and tasted like straw .
this was a serious disappointment .
it has gone downhill !
is there a new chef , an incompetent manager ?
i will not be surprised if elements closes .
last night it failed on all counts .
nothing ever changes , its always the same over the past two years .
the wine list is only fair .
pork chop was dry , margarita was not made properly .
until the waitress talked my friends into another type of vodka .
mine was ordered medium rare and there was no pink and no juice whatsoever .
totally tasteless .
two of the nine diners went hungry despite a $ _num_ bill .
very disappointed .
inattentive .
then , we were served a salad that soggy .
our second course was a crab bisque that was almost inedible .
there was an overpowering ginger flavor that ruined the bisque .
this meal was definitely not up to the reputation to say the least .
it was beyond annoying !
without the view , this restaurant would not make it .
unlike any i 've ever had , not in a good way .
so heavy on quinoa content , it overwhelmed everything else .
the experience would have been three star , except for the bathroom .
pee on the floor = bad bad bad !
we were looking forward to it but , unfortunately , were very disappointed .
it felt like they were trying to hurry us out of the restaurant .
the food was only fair and much too salty .
dinner was over $ _num_ with a mid priced bottle of wine .
i brought the problem to the attention of the manager .
waited for condiment until food got cold .
beautiful restaurant , but do n't go on a holiday !
waited _num_ minutes until anyone even greeted our table .
waited another _num_ for our drinks .
they brought out our appetizers with our entrees because they forgot about the appetizers .
they took another _num_ minutes to get those .
they gave us those mimosas for free , which was nice .
last night we stopped by for a couple of cocktails and some snacks .
we order a _num_ korean chicken quesadilla and a _num_ kale caesar salad .
for _num_ drinks and two snacks our bill comes to _num_ .
basically , you 're getting ripped off .
if you like having people insult you , be my guest .
something is definitely not kosher with this company , or maybe just this location .
they can keep that old lady crap !
i got _num_ dollars back .
i would n't even give them _num_ star .
looking through the reviews , i realize i am not alone .
disgusting !
dirty , crappy old bathrooms .
the bathrooms were around bad .
no , no , no .
what a waste of a cool building .
tastes like frozen dinners , like bottom of the line in quality .
also , the service is not too good .
also be prepared for him to forget that he took your order .
the margaritas are watered down and the beers are flat !
i mean really sucked .
the attempt at making fresh guac ' was pitiful .
the bowl of queso - not worth it one bit .
but that 's not all to a good margarita .
actually , just stay away .
do n't bother .
that is my neighborhood .
nypd is some of the worst pizza i 've ever had in my lifetime .
there was a little too much garlic on it for my liking .
you can also get pasta , panini , etc .
if you have a party of two , request a booth .
the table we were sat at was really small and smashed into a corner .
the service was mediocre at best .
there 's nothing really ny about this place .
in other words , their pizza is horrible .
i wish he just told me they were raw .
on one trip i ordered a pizza around noon for pickup at _num_ .
when i got it back to our hotel i could see something was wrong .
the pizza then sat there for seven hours and was then sold to me .
it was probably dangerous .
they refunded my money and gave me a gift certificate for another pizza .
raw pizza sucks .
what a waste of money .
the cashier turned a $ _num_ tip into $ _num_ .
the sauce tasted bland and the crust was not crispy at all .
also , it seemed like the vegetables were overcooked .
i try things over and over , sometimes when they suck too .
i do n't know what it is .
truly they 're better places than this in az .
_num_ minutes later we arrive at the restaurant and it is a zoo .
they gave me a cup for a complimentary small soda while i waited .
another _num_ minutes had gone by and we were finally given our food .
i took one bite and refused to eat any more of it .
even so this is not my complaint about this place .
no , thanks ... .
i have had better pizza and better customer service .
it all went downhill from there .
he was rude and dismissive .
she said it was otherwise ok , but had too much ricotta cheese .
i want to note that the restaurant staff were friendly and cheerful .
as we walked in , we were seating pretty quickly .
when the pizza finally came out , it was over cooked and wasnt great .
today ( at least at this location ) , i was wrong .
unless you 're a fan of poorly executed `` italian food , '' beware !
wow what a total disappointment here !
i tried their meat lovers pizza in _num_ inch for _num_ on menu .
a total ripoff no meat on meat lovers pie !
_num_ inches on each side had no meat .
i 've tried a few times .
had good had pretty bad .
save your money and go to the freezer section of your local grocery store .
unfortunately , my experience with the staff leaves much to be desired .
during football season , thursday night is pizza night .
we would n't recommend going to this location .
our waitress that time had complete disregard for it .
she did n't even write it down just to be safe .
zero stars for service .
never refilled our drinks .
half of my kids meals were never even given to us .
we wo n't be going back .
i literally have never had worse service .
just a bad experience all around .
she was friendly enough , just not attentive whatsoever .
we are so disappointed because the other location was so awesome !
the overwhelming taste was fried batter , not fish .
i was disappointed .
the ratings and reviews on yelp raised my expectations for this place .
this place is just ok .
the calamari and shrimp appetizers were just average .
i would not spend my money here , especially at their prices .
the soup course consisted of a vegetable lobster soup .
i 'm sorry , but that 's unacceptable .
he never once returned to check on our entree or dessert course .
after finishing the meal , the server returned to drop the bill .
apparently they do n't split checks .
i 'm sorry my friend , you should have told us .
razz 's failed on every occasion .
we did n't have a very good experience at razz 's .
for some reason , razz and/or his staff does n't know this .
one of the worst meals i 've had .
this also was very disappointing .
the only thing nice about this dish was the broth which was wonderful .
the shrimp were hard and gummy , the muscles were bitter and rubbery .
i was so disappointed the waiter looked sad !
good food , bad service or actually no service .
no water refills , wine that was ordered never arrived .
i am sorry , i am unsure what everyone was taking about .
this is not the place for fine dining .
it was very dry .
the veggies , where not steamed enough , and mash seemed old .
ordered fries for the baby , and they had an strange oil taste .
another ordered a few other meals , and they were not happy either .
will not repeat .
but , the service was the worst i have ever had .
it started with a _num_ minute wait for my $ _num_ glass of wine .
are you kidding me ?
gas pumps are very nearly useless .
the pumps will not accept debit , only credit .
every time i have gone in , i see customers frustrated with the pumps .
they employees seem to understand how .
no , i wo n't drive across town and use more gas .
sorry , but my experience was not what most of yours was .
i did n't want to just get rid of it .
i went to complete vacuum , and it was horrible .
they have _num_ star .
in any case , i would not recommend this place .
customer service is not a focus of this office .
generally , no one takes responsibility for issues like this .
dr was n't the friendliest , assistants very nice though .
i will not be going here again and would not recommend them to anyone .
after waiting for _num_ minutes i had to cancel and leave .
i 'll update after my appointment but this is definitely not a good start .
they are late calling in prescription .
the only time i ever went was to eat at the italian restaurant .
this was a total nightmare .
she had everything needed & just had me fill out the paperwork .
he had my x-ray & asked me why i think i need surgery .
he should look & see that my teeth are being destroyed without surgery !
are you kidding me ?
i would n't refer my worst enemy to him .
oh , and also slices of plain white bread .
and they were n't good , on top of that .
they would customize the cheeses - at a price .
ugh .
so not impressed .
i should have taken a picture .
come on guys ... it 's a bruschetta , not sashimi .
the _num_ stars are because it was not a good value .
in this case , sadly , i did n't .
never once have i been made to feel very welcomed .
i had a lazy afternoon and was excited to check it out .
so they have a large wine selection ... do n't eat there !
these people are the worst .
just mean for no reason .
i hate dealing with them .
curt and impersonal .
avoid at all costs !
residents need to hire their own attorney to represent them in key problems .
i told them which insurance i use and i was quoted a price .
there was no apology .
so i left .
of course they have n't gotten back back to me .
me : `` hello , i 'd like to schedule an appointment with dr .
me : `` no , i have n't . ''
`` i 'm sorry .
it was n't that big of a deal , but i was quite confused .
been a resident here for _num_ months .
new ownership right after i signed 2nd year lease in july .
since that time service has dropped to horrible levels .
shower head broke off - _num_ days to replace .
said he 'd be back in _num_ minutes .
only _num_ maintenance guy on staff .
now , our washing machine is broken .
wrong !
so it is n't overflowing now .
again , only _num_ maintenance guy on staff .
a week and still no washer ?
but there is neither , just excuses .
i am sick of this .
it looks worse than when it went in .
avoid this place if you value your guitar .
thanks for wasting my time and money chuck .
i went back and the watch was gone .
the room was fine , but i would n't rave about it .
room was cozy , and the beds were comfortable .
however , the room smelled old and musty .
no more , no less .
not the greatest cocktails but they were tasty .
wrong !
talk about a disappointment .
sitting by the fire pits , listening to the live music is super .
then it went downhill .
then five minutes after the guacamole was served , the entrees arrived .
unfortunately , the waiter was nowhere to be found .
however , the spa left much to be desired .
however , this was the worst massage i 've ever had .
first off , the masseuse reeked of garlic ; the smell was overwhelming .
the masseuse apologized saying that he was sorry i did n't enjoy my massage .
that was four days ago and nobody has bothered to return my call .
boo , not very good customer service .
we just checked in and out of the camelback inn .
what an awful experience we have just had .
it could not accommodate our family of five .
they put us in another room , but it was not yet ready .
the rooms in this hotel are bad .
the prices they charge are outrageous for what you get .
i am over _num_ feet tall as well as my two boys .
the double sized beds were not acceptable .
i am leaving very disappointed .
the rooms are musty and old with dirty carpet .
upon check out i inquired about the _num_ resort fee on my bill .
this facility is _num_ star for sure .
the _num_ stars comes from the worst facial i 've ever had .
i lost half of them on my right eye by the end .
and he was immediately apologetic and comped my service .
i run a salon and spa so of all people i get it .
lots of empty stations .
i walked out and did n't finish the pedi .
hotel room was ok .
double sink was nice .
carpet was surprisingly dirty .
the restaurant prices were high ( standard for a resort ) .
therefore the quality to price ratio was very low .
this is not to say there are not positives .
the bathrooms have seen some updating but not to the standards seen at sanctuary .
i check the ac and turn it down and nothing happens .
room _num_ : i am relocated tom room _num_ .
i check through the room and find no issues .
i did not taste anything that i did not like .
breakfast buffets do not require much in the way of table service .
our experience fell short of some basic expectations .
toward the end of the meal , a female manager walked by .
while there , the same manager walked by us .
that was last year ... still no phone call or other contact .
yes the `` staff '' reached out to me .
just able to post that they reached `` out '' to me .
i was very excited to stay at the sanctuary , but left very disappointed .
there is no tub in the room .
beyond disappointed .
i am truly embarrassed and disappointed .
none the less , the girls feel like they were n't wanted .
room service is awful .
overall , i would n't recommend this hotel .
the place is pretty but internet is horrible .
do n't know if ill would stay there again ... ... .
to make matters worse , i saw him talking to other guests about us .
this was not an _num_ and older pool .
after we ordered , they said they never told us they would do that .
spend your money on another one .
elements ' chilean seabass is to die for .
drain in shower smells like back up sewage .
_num_ pool is kind of small .
read good reviews , so decided to spend a weekend here .
room is kind of old , nothing special about it .
_num_ pool is kind of small .
it is not worth to splurge over $ _num_ per night to stay here .
we ended up checking out and will never return .
my wife , toddler son and i stayed for _num_ days at the sanctuary .
management really needs to work on communication amongst its workers .
we fell in love instantly !
yes i have ac at home but this was ridiculously loud !
it was horrible and stressful !
the bed and pillows were hard and uncomfortable !
i got more sleep in the hospital after having my babies !
avoid jade room _num_ or go when it 's not summer !
the service afterwards was terrible .
_num_ different occasions of complete rudeness .
we live out of state and made the mistake of trusting them .
going to sue them this week if i do n't hear from them .
would not recommend this company !
the blue book is $ _num_ .
he insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen asap .
horrible customer service .
none of it was necessary .
are you kidding me ?
i 'm not moving in !
they suggested i leave the car but could n't guarantee anything would be done .
i 'm going to possibly waste a day in hopes the car gets serviced ?
wasted _num_ hrs in drive time , gas money .
my loyalty to them meant nothing .
i 'm not kidding .
no flat screen and nothing over _num_ '' .
this is not a resort or modern in the way you are thinking .
no resort should have that kind of a/c .
if you pay more then $ _num_ you will be disappointed .
we checked in , and the place was empty .
no thanks , just a king room .
we get to the pool ... empty .
boring .
no service and no people .
ill review it next .
this place wasnt worth the staycation or the money spent .
if you are looking for a staycation , this is not the place .
stayed here for _num_ nights , and my room was n't even serviced once .
was not satisfied in one way shape or form .
20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
$ _num_ a day resort fee does not include wifi .
the actual room it self was dated and felt dingy .
a holiday inn would have probably been nicer .
while the staff was mostly great , the room was not .
and they could n't move us from it because supposedly they were booked .
even leaving the window open for six hours did n't help .
would i stay here again , only if someone else was paying for it .
check-in was a tad cold , not very welcoming .
i would say this is a 2-3 star place , and not any more .
i was also disappointed that they did n't provide a microwave and fridge .
are you kidding me ?
probably not .
staff gets _num_ stars - but old dated smelly rooms gets _num_ star .
resort ?
the rooms feel more like a motel than anything else .
a $ _num_ tax on the internet use .
happy hour price was $ _num_ including tax .
i gave the bartender ( nj name plate ) $ _num_ .
he looked at me , like , yes ?
he acted , like oh yeah , i forgot .
no tip for you .
i hate these kind of places .
mattresses on both beds were worn out years ago .
ridiculous and false advertising .
terrible hotel .
the hotel was n't interested .
after they take your money , they wo n't even return a call .
i have no less than _num_ charges on my credit card .
there should have just been _num_ : the room and the mini bar .
this has to be the worse hotel ever !
beyond disgusting !
a bed bug , is a bed bug , regardless !
this place has ruined my whole weekend !
worst stay ever !
worse experience !
horrible customer service !
the staff seems to be just as much as a pest !
not _num_ .
i would never stay here again .
the walk from the lobby to the room requires a ride in a cart .
if you 're paying more than $ _num_ per night , look elsewhere .
would not recommend scottsdale plaza resort to anyone .
do n't bring your convention here !
the shuttle drops us off and tells us to go inside to register .
i hand him a $ _num_ tip and thank him .
do n't let a poor experience in this place ruin your trip .
priceline gave this a _num_ star rating .
fail .
the walls are paper thin .
the bed is n't comfortable .
i would try elsewhere .
disappointing since i was expecting a four star experience .
disgusting !
priceline listed this as a _num_ star resort in scottsdale .
frankly , turning on my phone 's hot spot is faster and cheaper .
gross .
there are _num_ star hotels very nearby for the same price .
horribly outdated , shabby , can hear neighbors , loud wall unit a/c .
will say the staff was friendly though .
the breakfast i had sucked tho .
denny 's served far better breakfast , i 'm sorry .
do n't let the attempt at chatting with me in this post fool you .
dropping them from _num_ stars to _num_ .
if i could give this hotel zero stars i would !
if you want a refrigerator , that 'll be $ _num_ extra .
we wound up staying at the hampton inn in scottsdale instead .
the scottsdale plaza sucks !
dark , tired rooms .
wi-fi is not good .
disappointed not to be giving a better review .
reserved a room here for the navy ball .
he refused .
he knew i was unhappy but said it was my hair 's fault .
she just shrugged and gave me my receipt .
i would never ever ever book another stay here even if it was free .
( which it was n't , even after everything that happened ! )
one of the worst hotel experiences of my life .
this hotel was represented on hotwire as a luxury _num_ star resort .
yet all the negative reviews you read on yelp directly applied to our room .
i 'd give this place _num_ stars if i could .
i 'm also done with hotwire and their misleading bait and switch tactics .
basically i was stuck with this reservation .
did anything crawl into my clothes i laid out to wear that day ?
i hate this place and i will never stay here again .
do n't let the exterior fool you , the rooms are horrid .
even though they charge a $ _num_ resort fee .
my curtains are hanging off the windows and stained .
parking sucks too !
not worth the cost .
but it 's not really .
the toiletries they supply are of poor quality .
they have a shuttle to the airport , but it is not free .
and really is only $ _num_ cheaper than a taxi .
do not rent a meeting room from this hotel !
we were charged $ _num_ a day to have power in our meeting room .
we had to stay _num_ night in scottsdale on our road trip to texas .
here 's my issue and yes , i am partially the blame .
at check-in , i mentioned i have a _num_ lbs dog .
at $ _num_ it 's overpriced and uncomfortable .
they discounted service , but i was still unsatisfied .
service was generic , uncomfortable , lack luster for a resort at this level .
i should have read yelp before booking this place .
the room was spacious but no way worth the price .
silly me , i believed their website .
and the towels were low quality and smaller than any decent hotel should have .
they encourage you to leave it in front outside where everyone comes and goes .
ordered room service and what we ordered is not what was delivered .
and it 's not even a large bottle .
tacky , tacky , tacky !
not a resort .
not more than _num_ stars .
so i do not recommend !
i give this place zero stars !
the room was smelly , musty and obvious cigarette smoke .
this hotel has terrible service especially at the pool .
it was like a bad episode of bar rescue .
staff was rude and apathetic during our stay .
after a family emergency , i had to cancel my appointment at this resort .
what was the most frustrating was that nobody would help our situation .
based on this experience i would never stay here again .
what 's worse is that i had been going to this resort for years .
i 've stayed here at least _num_ times with no problems .
the biggest lacking feature is the most important - the rooms .
priceline does n't care about our concerns and neither does the hotel .
i 'm really angry that we were taken advantage of .
big but not functional .
the worst thing was we found blood stains on the sheet .
the hotel is not four stars as stated .
i would only give _num_ stars .
unfortunately there was confusion with my reservation .
i was very disappointed and it caused a lot of stress .
i will not go back .
not impressed with this hotel .
the hotel is very very old .
i stayed at this property for _num_ days .
upon checkout they told me i had a zero balance .
at this point i 'm totally lost .
i could n't believe my ears .
the most terrible experience .
the customer service was an absolute nightmare at this hotel .
they did nothing absolutely nothing to accommodate us or fix their error .
i would not recommend staying here at all !
emily , the supervisor checked us out .
the only digital channels that worked were two kids channels and several sports channels .
and even those did n't work as the signal was so bad .
most of the channels said no signal .
terrible ... .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
i would not trust this company ever again .
all i know is i will never step foot in that place again .
internet is abysmal and spotty .
the worst motel _num_ is better kept up than this .
horrible for the price , a huge disappointment .
if it was possible to give a _num_ star review they deserve it .
i am going to start with the worst .
i called hotel tonight when i saw our card had was charged .
it is obvious the owners do n't care about their customers .
i do not see how they are still in business .
i am sure they wo n't be for very long .
it smells like old people .
maybe a chicken salad sandwich .
food quality began to suffer as recipes and ingredients were changed .
cheese sauce which used to be made there was coming out of a can .
unfortunately i made the decision to try this place out .
i made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta .
same goes for the rest of the food .
their margaritas are flavorless and weak .
the chips are bland and dry and their salsa is very american .
the plate was covered in a mountain of rice and junk .
i had _num_ margaritas and could n't even draw a buzz .
the place is huge , but pretty much empty when we got there .
the rice was overcooked and hard .
not only did he `` look around '' he sprayed my room !
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .
there are too many other choices around there .
probably the worst bike shopping experience i 've had so far .
generally very poor and rude service .
just replace it , it 's only _num_ bucks .
i was like , you have black chain ?
i declined and whatever .
this was the worst service we have ever seen .
rude customer service .
also , my husband found the brake pads he needed at rei .
lazy mechanics !
that 's just bad workmanship .
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
did not check to see if it was still leaking .
_num_ minutes later when i got back to work it was flat again .
lazy !
people there are rude and talk down to you .
my tires went immediately flat every other ride .
luckily i went to a different , nearby store and was treated much better .
however , this small place crowded store left me wanting more ... more space .
six of us went to dinner on saturday evening to celebrate a birthday .
his response was that he did not have the authority to do that .
another _num_ minutes brought us our dinners .
unfortunately , they were inedible .
one of the meals was so overcooked it had to be sent back .
this whole horrible evening had started at 6:30 pm .
the waitress came running over with our bill .
the six of us went out for yogurt because we were really very hungry .
it was certainly not how we planned on celebrating our friend 's birthday .

by contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy .
i sure did n't get that vibe .
it was more _num_ 's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me .
salmon was unremarkable .
dinners are all ala carte .
nothing was particularly bad , just nothing to get excited about .
at a total of $ _num_ ( no alcohol ) we expected more .
food was average and the wait staff was horrible !
no let me guess what you have !
our salads arrived promptly at _num_ ( _num_ hour after being seated ) .
we finished our salads and sat waiting for our entrees .
overall i will not be back and was n't impressed at all .
no it was n't .
we ate our food and drank our one drink , and waited .
no menu .
no dessert .
no water refills , much less drink refills .
no bill .
first , as mentioned , the steak was not cooked correctly .
when walking in , the decor is old and drab .
the hostess was unpleasant and lighting , too bright .
the food ?
warm rather than hot , and drab .
we will never go back .
pathetic times _num_ !
went using a groupon .
new york strip was simply awful .
poor cuts of meat .
i would never go back .
salad was the beet salad - not bad but heavy handed with the dressing .
potatoes swimming in oil and no flavor .
spinach , again lacked flavor and sat in too much creme .
the only positive about this place was the server .
the food was terrible .
way too much sauce and nothing special .
my husband got the chicken piccata and it was awful .
the roasted vegetables were decent but the garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special .
the decor was seriously lacking .
not impressed and i wo n't be back .
just fyi , it 's mostly an older crowd .
like _num_ older , not _num_ older like we are .
most of the food was bland .
i ordered many sides and all the vegetables were bland .
my advice if you go : try the mozzarella salad .
but for the prices i would definitely go someplace else .
this is the worst restaurant i have been in a long time !
i had a cold so i asked for french onion soup .
it was so salty that it was not edible .
it was terrible .
my husband $ _num_ rib-eye steak was also extremely salty and terrible .
there is a $ _num_ charge for sharing anything .
there are no potatoes or mashed .
they changed the menu to the worst .
do not buy deals for this place at all .
will not go there ever again .
the waiter gave my daughter a complimentary dessert .
i will not be going back due to the tacky service .
the dessert was $ _num_ , the experience left a bad taste .
decent food , but $ _num_ per person ?
$ _num_ glass of wine charged twice for one glass .
turkey dinner excellent but $ _num_ ?
we 'll not be back .
personally , i 've lost all faith in yelp .
given my experience , i now have reservations when reading yelp review .
prices are high & do not get much for the price .
like an item , they charge you anyway .
no service , no one cares !
probably the worst dining experience of my life .
drinks and water served at 8:00 .
fixed price _num_ course menu .
entree was not served until after 9:00 pm .
steak ordered medium was served well done and cold .
sent back and received a rare steak that was too tough to chew .
desert followed but nothing special .
there is no excuse for this .
this experience ruined what should have been wonderful weekend getaway .
i have to say it was the worst groupon experience we 've ever had .
very limited menu is uninspired .
sauce was spicy and unlike any steak i was ever served .
past experiences were good but after this one , we will not return .
we get there for 5:30 reservation and the place is empty .
soup and salad course were fine .
no special flavor .
_num_ ) we do n't do that .
_num_ ) we paid over $ _num_ for dinner .
she ca n't forget that moment .
we will not take it .
prices are high & do not get much for the price .
like an item , they charge you anyway .
no service , no one cares !
the worst place .
expensive and you get tiny portions , there is a sharing charge .
do not waste your money .
to start , i would give zero stars if an option .
the menu is small and limited to very few options .
the service was also horrible i asked for a desert menu twice .
there loss of money .
worst service ever experienced .
terrible , bland food .
shrimp appetizer , bland , no flavor .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
even desert was sub par .
skip this one .
however , from the start our server was extremely rude .
she was not attentive at all .
that said however , the food both times has been bland and very uninspired .
many of the guests that were there were getting ready to leave .
the steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy .
the vegetables on the side are n't worth mentioning .
it was not happy and we left in well under an hour .
just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat .
there were about _num_ fries , wilted and lukewarm .
the burger was simply not good and the server was worse .
i wo n't be going back .
that 's where it ends , though .
well i was disappointed .
disappointing .
maybe i just got the wrong dishes ?
we 've been going there nearly monthly for over _num_ years .
this last time , our service was just terrible !
if this had been our 1st visit we 'd never go back .
homemade potato chips with bacon , cheese and bbq sauce .
how bad can that be ?
but no one ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers .
no , or at least not until we 'd paid the tab .
he then stopped by and gave us _num_ cards .
but , i 've been going there for years and years and years .
starting back in _num_ when we were on a vacation here from chicago .
amateur night is best left for other venues which cater to cheap karaoke .
one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time .
the chicken in the chicken thai salad was dry and hard .
she never made any attempt to make the situation better .
obviously poor training for management and for waitstaff .
the slices were very thick , and my jaw still hurts from chewing .
he came back a few minutes later with our drinks and a cold appetizer .
we placed our entree order and our food was just ... bad .
one order was undercooked , the other overcooked .
the manager on this day handled my cold food issue with professionalism and courtesy .
unfortunately , i have never had that here .
the waiter was bored and too busy chatting with fellow waiters .
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
my chicken was cold and i asked for vinaigrette not cesar dressing .
however there could be an improvement on their brunch items .
the eggs were under cooked and the hollandaise was very bland .
overall we did not feel we received our value today .
wife and i went here one night to try it out .
it is down the road from our house .
the bartenders were very attentive and helpful .
i probably will not go back , just not my thing .
very disappointed in the food !
it was nothing special and very oily .
a very bad excuse for crab cakes .
he ordered the mac & cheese for his side and it was terrible .
really soupy and had a strange flavor .
almost like there was mayonnaise in it .
the only good thing we had was the broccoli side for him .
we left the meal feeling gross .
yes , $ _num_ for a bad meal .
will never go back and do not recommend .
for some reason today we did not have the best service .
i 'm hoping our next dining experience here will be better .
sadly last night was not at all how i had remembered it .
i was just really disappointed in the quality of the food i received .
food was average at best but the worst part was the poor customer service .
in addition , they do not offer a military discount .
unfortunately , i never got the call .
the customer service continues to be lacking with poor follow through .
surprisingly , i am giving this place _num_ stars .
unfortunately our service was not .
even visited the dmv to confirm .
very unfortunate and we are not likely to return .
the food on the other hand was bland .
if this place had better food would of been four stars for sure .
terrible service .
we went with a group of _num_ adults and one child tonight .
food was wonderful , the problem was the service .
not really .
there was no personality to our server .
waited over _num_ minutes for our entrees .
at 12:30 on a monday , it was virtually empty .
she ordered the calamari and i chose the asian chicken .
if i would have paid full price , i would have been upset .
the service was slow and the food did n't have any flavor .
i was really disappointed especially after reading other reviews .
have to agree with katie l. unimpressive .
water and bread was served immediately .
overall , disappointing .
the chicken was tasty but somewhat overcooked and almost burned on the bottom .
went here because of its high rating , but was disappointed .
the decor is blah .
my boyfriend ordered a dip sandwich that was very blah looking .
the meat looked grey and the bun was very thick .
the au jus was sub par and the sandwich was cold .
i would have no reason to go back .
probably the worst italian food i 've ever had at a restaurant .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
you are obviously treated poorly when you buy a coupon that they offer .
a friend asked me about this review , almost a year later .
they obviously do n't care .
gon na keep this really simple because i 'm tired .
bad food .
terrible service !
nasty filet mignon .
the chicken shrimp pesto pasta was pretty good though .
to their credit the food wait time was short .
not that it was n't requested .
would definately not return !
the salads were even bad .
the interior of this restaurant does n't look at all like i expected .
no warm music , no tablecloths , no italian paintings .
nothing offensive about them .
we tried this restaurant for the first time for dinner and were disappointed .
there was no italian ambience .
it seemed very plain and cold .
my husband and i tried _num_ different chicken dishes .
not much flavor , just a hint of lemon .
his chicken was tastier but still bland .
the portion was large on both dishes , but lacked in flavor .
also there was not a varied choice of pasta .
only _num_ types were available .
the bread was cold and tasteless .
that was the only thing i enjoyed .
not even any pictures on the wall , no tablecloths , etc .
doubt if we will ever return to this restaurant again .
there are many other italian restaurants that are better than this one .
the server seemed overwhelmed despite there was only about _num_ occupied tables .
he stated the patio was full and it would be a thirty minute wait .
terrible service .
very rude food server .
embarrassed to have brought my family there .
service was terrible !
my mom , husband and i split a caesar salad .
my dad and i split a margherita pizza .
when it came we should have sent it back .
disgusting .
we cut off the ends and ate the rest of the pizza .
gross .
gross .
this time , the restaurant was n't even full .
of meat and _num_ pounds of bread ?
note : this review only includes a review of my entree .
my aunt ate her dish so i 'm assuming it was tasty .
my calamari was so so .
my issue is with the professionalism of the staff .
she told them she did n't need their business .
you ca n't mess up ice cream - so enough said .
the service here was horrible .
extremely bad customer service !
stupid .
have not been here in such a long time .
i came here on a friday night in february with my boyfriend .
he did n't offer that i could get another , he demanded .
seriously terrible customer service .
it 's not that difficult to serve ice cream and chicken fingers .
this is my first and last time going to this dq .
as you can see from the photo , it was soggy and gross .
it 's just a kid for crying out loud .
needless to say , i will be paying them a visit and contacting corporate .
sad , i miss the old days .
not nearly enough topping !
bathrooms are filthy , which makes me nervous about food safety .
there were only three tables occupied , but the hostess ignored us .
the thermostat on the wall read _num_ degrees .
another table of diners was extremely loud .
overall it was a miserable evening .
to sum up , tiramisu is unwelcoming , hot and loud .
if you want an enjoyable evening out with friends , go elsewhere .
and to be charge more than $ _num_ for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous .
sadly , neither was true at ruth 's chris steakhouse .
heck no !
high prices do not equal good food .
the worst steak i 've ever had .
what kind of restaraunt would do that to a steak ?
i am being very generous here , because the expectations were so much higher .
oh hell no !
no apologies , no manager apologies , nothing .
none of the staff seemed up and happy .
i went because i was given a $ _num_ gift certificate .
this server had more than enough assistance and the bar was dead .
this was not victoria 's fault .
this was done by a gentleman that was of first assistance .
i ordered a glass of dessert wine that compliments chocolate .
they did n't act up what so ever .
very disappointed .
w/ side of spinach au gratin .
i just looked at my mom and said ... i can not eat this .
btw ... spinach au gratin was really tasty .
why go back ?
confirmed reservations were ignored or not honored .
does each visit really have to take _num_ and a half hours ?
the food is ordinary ... no comparison to the capital grille or others .
each and every time we had such bad service we were given free desserts .
they clearly understood that our experience was bad .
please fix _num_ , _num_ , & _num_ above .
after the last time i have stopped going and will not be back .
it could have been any family restaurant in a strip mall .
i did not get an upscale steakhouse vibe at all .
they brought out our salads before we had finished with the appetizer .
it had big chunks of shaved parmesan in it which was cool .
personally , i would have appreciated some seasoning besides butter on my petite fillet .
it was not melted or seared in as i was expecting .
however , the meat was extremely flavorless .
no complaints there .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
so my first visit to this place was back in _num_ .
wednesday not friday or saturday .
no standing .
too bad .
the one and only time flemings has messed up a steak they comp 'd .
pretty sad , nowhere near the hype .
every time they do n't have the food on the menu .
and the third was the cattle that were shipped was bad .
the first _num_ times i thought ok but this is the third time .
do n't you think they should have someone ordering enough food ?
the manager whom is a lady was very rude and could care less .
sunday , november _num_ .
shame on you ruth 's chris steak house , and your chef as well .
and the lobster tails were the same tiny size as my mothers .
dinner for _num_ people , $ _num_ not including the tip .
we requested him again , however he was not scheduled until later that evening .
it only went downhill from there .
the steak was weird tasting .
instead , we got average food and pretty bad service .
look at my other reviews ... we are not super picky and ridiculous people .
probably not the most amazing first experience i 've had at a restaurant .
food was pretty good , the wait service was disappointing .
our waiter was very polite but four of our steaks were not prepared properly .
not even close .
service was n't attentive or bad .
went there saturday night for my wife 's birthday .
they must have had an off night as everything was below standards .
the fries were soggy and limp and the experience was disappointing !
but unfortunately , dont think i will .
we stopped eating there because their service is awful !
do not go eat here or pick up food .
believe me i 've been a manager at a ruth 's chris before !
quite a disappointing visit .
i would say about _num_ % of the filet was a chunk of fat .
that should never be the case with a filet in any decent restaurant .
i would hesitate to go back in fear of the same experience .
ate here during restaurant week and was looking forward to the seafood trio .
so disappointed !
sadly disappointing .
_num_ minutes later .
_num_ minutes after seating the server finally comes to take our order .
worst dentist i have had in my _num_ years of life .
i came to have my teeth worked on , not see a show .
he went in to clean my teeth and did a horrible job .
his staff has no clue what 's going on either .
my shirt was soaked with water from hose dripping down my back .
unbelievable .
horrible .
horrible .
horrible .
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
we sat on down and ordered our food .
we got a crappy sake recommendation that literally tasted like bitter water .
i heard rumors , but i drove by tonight just to see for myself .
sure enough , sign is down and space is completely empty .
do you think it was because of the _num_ star yelp reviews ?
open _num_ hours with minimal choices of entrees to pick from the menu .
do n't come here if that 's exactly what you 're looking for .
too bad there 's really no late night spots in the valley .
took ten ( _num_ !
minutes to get a drink refill and our waitress only had three tables !
ugh .
in my opinion this salon is dark and outdated .
needless to say with these ridiculous layers , i look awful .
she clearly did n't care for me _num_ % but that 's another story .
the atmosphere was clean , so was the salon .
the stylist was a different one , also polite but cold .
he found a million and one excuses to why the hair color failed .
no excuses ... .
very expensive place , do n't waste your money there .
the cut cost $ _num_ but it was more like a $ _num_ cut .
my friend went as well and was equally unimpressed .
i wo n't go back .
this place is out of control lol !
now they call me _num_ days later to confirm the appointment !
i ordered dinner for me and girlfriend at _num_ pm through their app .
_num_ comes still no pizza .
i worked in pizza biz do by this time there was probably one driver .
so _num_ min after my order and it came in cold .
i 'm most likely gon na have my pizza delivered from elsewhere .
received an email after placing my order online stating a _num_ minute delivery time .
there was no effort made to contact me and no apologies offered .
there was a tea party area and a little salon area .
very disappointing for anyone who 's ever had a real tea party .
customer service is awful .
she went in the back and returned with four cupcakes smashed into a napkin .
please avoid this place .
it 's not worth the money , drive or time .
please do n't make the same mistake .
lots of dust and old merchandise .
now to the ugly about this place ... it 's grossly overpriced .
it 's a shame management is so nasty and nickel and dime .
this place is a total rip off !
$ _num_ to dry clean a ladies suit jacket ?
ridiculous !
no thanks .
i had _num_ work shirts that my company gave me and they fit awful .
refused to refund money or even offer to make it look any better .
thank you european cleaners for wasting my time , money , and patience .
i went back second time to give them another try .
do n't waste you time and money going to european cleaners !
some of the teachers are great , others can be very cold .
however , they stop teaching computers in middle school , which i found odd .
in the end , you realize , your child is just a dollar sign .
walking past the charming courtyard , i was rather dissapointed with the inside interior .
wine list is extensive but outrageously overpriced .
food was completely uninspired and pedestrian .
nothing special here .
service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
i wish i could say nice things all the way around .
we also had our choice of _num_ possible entrees .
anyway , the potatoes were left .
value for money - very low .
i was so excited to visit lon 's after reading the reviews .
unfortunately , we did not find any of the above .
( we are from seattle where nobody cares what you wear to dinner ! )
very nice wait staff , just slow .
at one point we received our wine _num_ minutes after the course showed up .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
the veal looked and tasted like duck !
the wines were all very young which is ok if they were good .
the bad : my sister ordered the sea bass which was served with clams .
should n't he have sent out a replacement anyway ?
_num_ ) only _num_ chocolate dish on the dessert menu .
she proceeded to ignore us for _num_ minutes while we waited to be sat .
i had almost the same bad experience as another reviewer .
however , the food has gone downhill .
it tasted nothing like calamari .
the sea bass i ordered was very average .
but , for $ _num_ an entree ' i expected something better .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
some place where they really want your business .
if you 've lived elsewhere you know what i am referring to .
no offer of drinks in the meantime .
no sincere attempt from lon 's at making this memorable .
finally seated _num_ min later !
the waiter could n't even explain why .
why list was crazy expensive too and not that great .
save your money and do n't bother going !
very disappointed .
lon 's was a complete bust .
while the service was just okay , the food was just terrible .
i felt greasy after eating it , which was a shame .
the service was extremely slow , especially waiting for drinks from the bar .
the quality of the food was less than mediocre for high prices .
the entire experience was not a good one .
we went to mcdonald 's after instead of wasting more money on the food .
i did not leave happy , since the food was mediocre at best .
_num_ stars for the ambiance , _num_ stars for the waiter and service .
i did n't even get to sit with my friend to celebrate her birthday .
our service is the reason why this review is getting a lower rating .
since the server never came around , i think she just dealt with it .
my bite of monkey bread and the omelet were both good .
i want to show them off to my friends from out of town .
my short rib was braised perfectly , however , it was dry and lean .
lon 's , here 's some advice from the cheap seats .
do n't want to even give lon 's one star .
it was highly recommended by the concierge of the hotel where we stayed .
this is the worst restaurant meal i have ever had .
there were twelve in our group and ten of the twelve meals were unacceptable .
not only were the entrees horrible the appetizers and desserts were equally bad .
the food was bland and flavorless .
for example my entree was served with truffle gnocchi .
the $ _num_ steak was loaded with fat and cooked wrong .
one of them was sent back , the other only partially eaten .
he could n't have been more rude .
avoid this restaurant at all cost !
although the food presentation was nice , the dishes had no flavor .
i ordered the braised short ribs with truffle gnocchi .
these should be full of flavor and it was bland .
no truffle flavor whatsoever .
it was early august so the restaurant was not overly busy .
for the prices they are charging the food should wow and it did not .
when told to contact the manager , he has n't returned our call .
new lunch menu looks like you 're dining at steak n shake .
prices way higher and portions way less .
all of the southwestern items are gone .
one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had .
we just stood there and off he went !
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
the young man was prompt , courteous and did all the right things .
lon 's is no longer the dining gem as it was in the past .
very sad .
the first bite was so salty i had to spit out .
did n't take a second bite !
the sandwiches were cold , dry and unappetizing and the bread was stale .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
our server jason was the most condescending , disrespectful person i have ever met .
my family and i will never set foot in this establishment again .
unfortunately the service from that point forward failed .
but his off night may have cost lon 's a few new customers .
service tried hard so that counts .
just very marginal in my opinion .
oh , i did mention the fruit plate , did n't i ?
terribly overcooked .
unable to eat them overcooked .
no website or confirmation telling us set menu vs regular menu !
ridiculous !
the food , however , had way too much salt on it .
the food was a major disappointment .
the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
service was dismal , almost as if they had n't expected guests .
we were so excited to try this place out .
our server had _num_ tables max .
not what i would imagine from a nice place like that .
they did n't have a place to properly change her .
so disappointing !
my daughter went in for her wisdom teeth to be pulled back in june .
it is beyond frustrating and not worth the hassle .
this whole experience has made me sick to my stomach and beyond frustrated .
avoid .
they do not honor what your insurance states you owe either .
terrible .
next , the food was miserable .
all of the chili sauce at pei wei 's could n't save the dish .
three of three strikes , shame on us for giving it another shot .
i was heavily disappointed .
terrible food , terrible service .
i ordered chicken fried rice .
the rice itself was cheap long grain rice .
disgusting .
the circle k in the same plaza has bigger cups for _num_ cents .
the lo mein has horrible , bland , no flavor even with extra sauce .
the vegetables with the beef were raw .
my girlfriend and i both ordered off the `` low fare dinner menu . ''
my girlfriend had mongolian chicken with brown rice and a spring roll .
nothing came close to tasting anything like chinese food .
it 's just gross .
i got the mongolian beef and my fianc ordered the pad thai .
they refunded us for our meal but we will not be back .
horrible customer service , sub-par food .
and , rude counter help does n't help at all ... .
a salty tasteless experience .
there was no ginger taste and it was super salty .
a flavorless meal .
do not use their new online service !
what a mess .
this is unacceptable and very disappointing .
i returned home from a summer on the pacific coast to an unfortunate surprise .
went to pei wei so many times and today is a disaster .
ordered spicy tuna roll and the thing came out ice cold .
sushi is supposed to be served at room temperature , not cold .
it tastes like it 's pre-made in the morning or the night before .
the rice was cold and dry .
no no no .
it is not .
worst meal ever .
not sure if they were just off this time or they do n't care .
tofu burnt and dry .
overall terrible .
i had corned beef with eggs over easy hash browns and toast .
my husband had the huevos rancheros , and said it was `` adequate '' .
it was not worth the price or the rude service .
we will most likely not be back .
the oatmeal we ordered had no taste .
generally speaking it was nothing worth coming back to .
_num_ mins goes by and we try to find our waitress .
we said no thanks and left .
that 's not how you treat customers .
they did n't seem sorry , more relieved because they needed the table .
so disappointing .
several times now , they have added hidden fees .
is n't that why we take dresses like that to a dry cleaners ?
i do not recommend this cleaners .
the staff is poorly trained .
they were unable to do that and clerk was rude .
they found shirt and called to pick up which i did .
very rude overall , will not use them again .
mistakes happen and we would have understood if they had been apologetic and accommodating .
i hate this place .
i had gotten a package with _num_ laser hair removal treatments .
however , i read the other negative reviews which were also true .
on my 5th laser appointment , i got burnt .
um sorry , i do n't think so .
however , she did say the technician should not have touched my nose .
not very good customer service in my opinion .
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
so i purchased all _num_ treatments at that time for $ _num_ .
after _num_ treatments you only need touch ups for $ _num_ .
very little to no pain involved in the actual procedure .
the customer service is awful .
the laser techs are very hit or miss .
pretty ridiculous .
waited _num_ more day then called the store .
they said she would call but she did not .
apparently they do not need our business .
do not use this franchise .
we left mid april and still did not have completed project .
ask lots of questions and then go find someone else to get one from .
it 's just not worth the risk .
i would have given a _num_ star for the service .
the guy brian is so rude .
my 1st encounter was not a good one .
he did n't listen to me and set up an appt for weight loss .
wasted my time .
the last visit i had , my appt was set for _num_ .
no courtesy call , email reminder or a friendly text .
treated us like we had never had any landscaping done before .
would not recommend .
i am only sorry i could not give it a _num_ star rating .
absolutely , without a doubt the worst bank i 've visited in az .
i went to this restaurant for the first time during fall _num_ restaurant week .
my recommendation to the restaurant : improve your quality or lower your prices .
do n't bother with this place .
there are much better french restaurants in phoenix .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
during off peak , you can get _num_ nights for $ _num_ .
this does not deserve to be called a resort .
the furnishings and amenities are not quality .
not a resort feel , more like an apartment complex .
their salesmen never let up on trying to get us to buy more time .
bed was comfortable but pillows were horrible .
woke up with headache everyday .
_num_ ) the refrigerator did n't work .
_num_ ) blood stains on both toilets .
_num_ ) _num_ % of the electrical outlets did n't work .
called the front desk , explained our problems and requested a new room .
first night of my honeymoon has been officially ruined .
find any other place in scottsdale .
ok , first i can say nothing bad about the room or amenities .
no call back .
i called and asked them to do so , housekeeping told me yes .
stayed here two nights on a week long vacation .
the water pressure in the shower was horrible and the water was extremely hot .
however since my friend was n't _num_ she was not allowed to sign up .
this place was absolutely horrible .
the fact that the maids that clean these rooms did n't notice is ridiculous .
they also claimed they ran out of pillows and could n't provide anymore .
the only great thing about this resort is the location .
we stayed a week and did n't get one nights rest .
the queen bed was horrible !
air conditioner was loud when it came on and the refrigerator was noisy .
no apologies , no concern .
we had also asked that our dogs had no group time with other dogs .
a vet student should know this or in fact anyone who could use google .
adding insult to injury .
do not go see this vet , what a horrible experience that was .
my family and i ate here a few months back .
the problem was the simple marinara sauce .
no thanks !
i would not recommend it at all .
we will not go back .
the bartender debbie was awesome .
i would have been fine picking my stuff up anytime later .
unfortunately , i do n't think i 'll come back here .
unbelievable .
i spend approximately $ _num_ per month on dry cleaning .
if i could give them no stars i would .
i was wrong !
i took in a jacket to be dry cleaning and they washed it !
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
i called immediately and the owner denied it was washed instead of dry cleaned .
i was a 1st time customer , as this location is in my neighborhood .
i was told all _num_ will be dry cleaned .
_num_ out of _num_ still had white cat hair on them .
this store is terrible !
the worst service i 've ever had !
amazingly terrible service .
i ca n't even say that starbucks has the best coffee and lattes around .
although the drinks get made , the service is terrible .
no extra caramel !
came at night so ca n't account for the view .
we ate there twice last week .
we took our friends for dinner , we all had salmon and trout .
it was okay , not what i would expect from them .
so sad .
our food was obviously of very low quality .
and the service was worse .
i just quit eating .
poor way to run a restaurant business .
they just lost _num_ customers but i 'm quite sure they do n't care .
& mgr .
go out of business .
basically that we could not get water , and it was _num_ degrees outside !
however , my excitement turned into disappointment by the end of the day .
- no gps .
very frustrating .
- only _num_ drink cart for _num_ courses ?
- the course itself was average , the greens average .
i expect much more out of a premier club in scottsdale .
greens were slow and course was overall in mediocre shape .
from my feet she should have been aware .
however , she barely looked at them .
now , there is no reason she could n't have spent more time .
i was very dissapointed .
i will never visit the salon again .
wow , just left this place after a staycation at the westin kierland .
not only were the tubs very dirty but they did a horrible job .
my friend went here for the 1st time , and will be the last .
very disappointed .
my friend was almost done by the time someone started doing anything for me .
i will not go here again .
they should call it a lotion application because that 's exactly what it was .
me had a cold .
i would n't go back nor would i recommend this place !
i went in for a fill with gel polish on tuesday .
it is now saturday and my nails are already starting to peel .
a few of my nails did not get polished to the edges .
i will not go back there .
then looked away and went back to doing what she was doing .
what a total disappointment .
man just so disappointing .
i would have never chosen to go here but my buddy made me go !
i hated to tell him that there was no mechanical bull back in _num_ .
the food was okay ... an outback steakhouse would have tasted better .
it tasted like calamari .
i should not be doing anything before reading the reviews on yelp first !
that was disappointing , but maybe we got there too early .
a little annoying , but the breakfast station line moves fast .
it was ok , nothing special .
no mechanical bull , no activities .
probably wo n't go back .
very disappointed .
do n't come here for the food .
the highlight was the little jalapeno cornbread muffin that came with it .
both were tiny and overcooked .
there was also a piece of toast which i also did not try .
this is a good place to get fat and poor .
there 's not a lot to do .
it would n't happen again for two hours .
ugh .
a burger is $ _num_ .
ate here last night with my husband for dinner .
the place was not busy at all .
half the restaurant was empty .
there were _num_ hostesses standing around and several very bored looking bus boys .
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
a steak house with no potatoes .
so i paid full price for a very sad steak dinner .
on that note , the budget is n't terribly cheap .
and that 's something you should n't try to cheap out on .
the service at thanksgiving dinner was the worst i 've ever seen .
my thanksgiving dinner was so cold i sent it back .
sadly , this was the year i brought _num_ friends with us .
i 'm no bbq expert , but the food at steakhouse was forgettable .
it was n't too sweet .
they were welcoming to regulars and tourists .
it was n't very busy for saturday night .
i wo n't spend any time on the `` town '' .
suffice to say it was disappointing .
the ambiance is not bad .
not sure that would help .
they have no bread service .
so after you order you have nothing to munch while you wait .
but for $ _num_ i expect a lot more .
the chicken was cooked through , but still cold .
not cold , but not even really lukewarm .
i do n't see how or it would have been hot .
i suspect it was reheated .
something is fishy here .
but i do n't buy that it was a fluke .
and doing a poor job of it .
this place is all hype , but they do n't perform .
we wo n't be going back .
next the food ... rattlesnake was no different from popcorn chicken .
it was not what i expected .
the steak and prime rib was dry and the sides were not good .
i spent a lot of money and was disappointed with the entertainment .
overall my experience was _num_ one star .
went here for thanksgiving dinner .
_num_ for adults and _num_ for kids .
i would go back , but i do n't think i would eat here .
not for everyone .
but we really could have gone without .
but there 's not much to get on or do .
and they charge for the some of the shows .
the town itself is really sad .
no man .
do not waste your money or your time here .
went here for easter lunch and shows .
wish we knew that they had bar food _num_ yards past the steakhouse .
but it probably sucks too !
all the employees were rude and clearly did not want to be there .
wish i did n't even have to leave one star .
these people today were truly awful !
they are playing mexican music on 4th of july ... not even speaking english .
there is stuff for sale and over priced food .
weight limit on everything .
they give boring dinner rolls with dinner now instead of the yummy corn bread .
my husband thinks the new menu is better .
they do n't even do the haunted train ride anymore .
the food is mediocre and the town is boring and expensive .
our first time there to visit .
we were very excited by what was presented online .
we were however disappointed after the experience .
the waitstaff were nice but slow and inattentive .
they did n't have it on the site that they charge for parking .
so after having to drive back to chandler and find an atm .
ca n't wait to see what else will happen .
the worst `` _num_ 4th of july event ever '' .
very disappointed .
i 'm disappointed and now searching for somewhere to eat .
a couple of drinks to start , really expensive .
you could n't even tell it was open .
she was sitting there hiding .
the girls were free because they were _num_ and _num_ .
ridiculous .
so this would be $ _num_ for the family .
shoot the fair is a better deal .
the place was dead on a saturday .
the dining room was empty .
she said we ca n't get you in for another _num_ hours .
she did n't care .
it does n't seem like anyone cares to want to have business there .
what a waste .
i would skip this and spend my money in the casino .
wow it was the strip mall carnival of the wild west .
not my scene , but may be yours and families .
food and service was underwhelming !
the worst 4th of july ever !
supposed to open again in october of _num_ .
anything done to the course will be a blessing !
on another visit , i waited over an hour in the waiting room .
he is very impersonal .
i had also visited another specialist and had an mri done .
i will not return to him or recommend him to anyone else .
the worst part of all though was the billing .
they did not bill as routine and i was charged over $ _num_ .
luckily i work in healthcare and l was able to figure this out .
has gone completely down hill to the point where they are extremely rude .
i used to come here all the time .
not anymore .
the service is awful .
i will gladly drive _num_ miles out of my way to the next subway .
next time do n't hire morons .
disgusting .
i ca n't believe i ate the food.
the tempura was okay , but the sauce served with it was rather bland .
we headed out for a nice evening of sushi and left very disappointed .
it was sitting in luke warm water and was wilted .
no salt on top or even on the side for our own taste .
i feel sorry for anyone with allergies to nuts .
the portion of fish on the salad was the smallest i 've ever seen .
needless to say it was promptly returned .
the last insult of the night had to be the worst .
i was really disappointed !
another customer refused to be seated in there while we were having dinner .
it tasted terrible .
he was very indifferent and kept saying no one else had complained about it .
the cucumber roll was boring .
the veggie roll did n't taste fresh .
even the chunks of avocado had brown spots on them .
we will not go back .
$ _num_ bill and i was not satisfied at all .
the service was attentive but the food was poor .
sorry - that 's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi .
we were very disappointed .
but we wo n't be back here again .
went here cause i wanted japanese style sushi .
i read some reviews , people said it was japanese style sushi .
the tuna , blech !
i honestly do n't understand how anyone can give this place any stars .
i only gave one star because i could n't give zero .
i went here based on yelp reviews ... are you serious ?
this was the worst sushi place i have been to .
we then ordered the volcano roll ... absolutely horrible .
skip this place .
hiro sushi is my new go-to .
i 'm sorry to say , nothing was that delicious or memorable .
the asparagus was served plain with a little sesame seed on top .
other restaurants give you steak in a bowl for about the same price .
would n't be back , would n't recommend .
smelled and tasted terrible .
so disappointed .
was hoping to have a local sushi place i could count on .
never went back .
i have gone here for years , but change of ownership this last month .
it is a shame it was great , but i would never go back .
i am not sure they know what they were talking about .
wo n't go back again .
i then brought _num_ shirts back to show him the holes .
they do not care about their residents .
the grounds are not well kept , the residents just throw trash all over .
but she has not done a thing .
my patio faces the green , disgusting pool .
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
and at this point may break my lease to do so .
this company is a poor excuse for an hoa .
maybe they have changed their hours but i do n't go back .
terrible , terrible , terrible customer service .
do n't bother , they do n't want the business and it shows .
terrible customer services .
rude staff .
forced to pay them to package a box they shipped me themselves .
stay far away from these problem people .
however , my recently visit was n't so satisfying .
he then explained a _num_ cent cd would cost me $ _num_ .
rude and careless staff .
no sense of urgency or customer service .
worst fedex location .
the two people that we 're working were absolutely rude .
did n't acknowledge that i needed help .
_num_ minutes later he was finished .
now i 'll tell you about the bad experience .
it really did n't make any sense .
i visited the desk _num_ ( ! )
times during my stay because my key did n't work .
also no adult bar open past dinner .
the customer service was not .
we had to call for toilet paper , dishwasher soap , etc .
this will be a _num_ and no more for us .
the owner has been difficult from day one promising to pay me cod .
every time , he gets a delivery he is supposed to pay .
one is a star too many .
we ordered _num_ appetizers ... the $ _num_ bruschetta and the $ _num_ wings .
i could n't stop laughing .
but i was not impressed by the hh specials or the food .
i really wanted to like this business .
i guess i 'll have to find another place to do my dry cleaning .
no offer to check , just `` i do n't know . ''
pathetic !
i left a rx there for _num_ hours .
stopped back by to pick it up and it was n't filled .
there were no other waiting customers , in the waiting area !
do n't make that mistake if you have to fill there .
i did n't get past the front desk .
i wo n't be making another appt here .
i was not called in until _num_ .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
they can barely handle making appointments .
none of the extreme symptoms were apparent .
i have spent $ _num_ and have recieved nothing from this vet .
once the dog is fixed then you can claim you have a clue .
all i have done at this point is point out my exact experience .
just wanting money .
my wife and i were disappointed with the staff and the veterinarian .
i am really disappointed with this clinic .
do not waste your time with this vet !
but that was the worst decision i could ever make .
i would not recommend dc ranch animal hospital to anyone .
my daughters $ _num_ crown fell out within _num_ weeks .
would not recommend this dental clinic .
it appears they are just after your money .
she is also rude .
that was over one week ago with no call .
horrible experience with billing issues and problems with a new crown .
they never return my messages .
constant staff change .
bad experience !
who the hell pays nearly $ _num_ to get their teeth cleaned ?
every time i went there would be all new hygienists and staff .
no apology from dentist .
obviously , no longer a customer .
but it had a very long way to go in that respect .
some clerks are helpful , a couple of them are not so much .
the menu has changed ... not for the better .
the place was empty on a saturday night !
tried charleston 's for lunch recently .
it was later and not too busy .
seems like man agent needs to shake things up .
night , very crowded , food good for price .
went back with another couple sunday , and it was totally different .
not crowded , no wait for a table .
several entree choices and no more baked potatoes .
sorry wo n't be back .
boy was this a disappointment .
the atmosphere is awful - really dark and heavy in the inside .
the patio was closed , for no good reason .
she repeated and said `` trust me '' .
ugh , avoid this place .
our server was lackluster .
i ordered an iced tea as my beverage and he never brought it .
cheap eats but i do n't think i 'll be jumping to go back .
ok , i have been a regular customer for a number of years .
ate in the bar and we ordered the prime rib and rib dinner .
the ribs were over cooked and dry .
disappointed by charleston 's reputation .
finished drinks and still no waitress .
it took _num_ minutes before our order was taken - at 9:00 at night .
finished my steak , still no cheese .
it was cold at this point .
hate to say , but probably will not be returning .
this place is very over rated .
service was terrible .
i am gluten free and checked the gf menu online .
but she said no .
i did n't want to fight with her and said forget it .
although the the filet was good , i will never eat there again .
here the girl at the door was looking down did n't even notice me .
i went in and sat at the bar , dirty tables all around me .
the bartender did n't say hi .
walked past me to put some juice away in a cooler .
the food was just as good as mesa but the service is horrible .
finally another server asked me if i needed one .
as i left not one person acknowledged my presence .
i wo n't be back to this location .
the service at charleston 's has truly gone downhill .
he really did n't seem to care whatsoever .
sorry not sorry .
the waiter never even gave us a pen to sign our bill !
i 'm sad to say that this place has truly fallen from grace .
was craving a french dip .
the bread was soggy when it arrived and the meat inside was cold .
nothing special .
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
all of this was _num_ .
everything , and i mean everything , was incredibly salty .
yeah , people can die .
what an expensive mistake !
i was served _num_ tiny pieces of fish .
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
it looked flat and it did not taste good .
the bill - over $ _num_ !
so totally not worth it .
i walked out hungry .
sorry mom - i will not go back .
food was great service bad .
the other servers were checking on there tables constantly .
i have been here _num_ different times on my business travel .
i am sitting here writing this review goin on _num_ min .
walked by _num_ x .
_num_ pm local and not busy .
just employees too busy chatting .
lost my business for the future .
maybe they need some lessons from the staff at capital grill across the street .
it was a big mistake !
horrible service !
the worst i 've had in years .
waiter getting our order wrong _num_ times in one visit .
forgetting to ever get drinks after drink order was taken .
waiter sitting on kitchen counter .
gross !
and still got it wrong .
about the waiter , wrong sides , and chicken being very over done .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
no sir .
i will not have dessert .
i wanted out of that restaurant as quickly as possible .
we have to hire another carpet cleaning company to clean our carpets .
my wife came in with a fedex flat rate package .
never going back .
really an average course that was fairly easy .
the bummer was no beverage cart when we played saturday and it was _num_ .
i would not golf here again .
to put it shortly , rude employees , overpriced items , and misleading signs .
first of all , they were quite expensive .
it died a horrible death .
once you make a purchase there 's no guarantee the plant would survive .
what a waste of time and money .
stay away from north scottsdale nursery and cactus .
their plants are healthy and they guarantee your purchase .
after spending almost $ _num_ and feeling ripped off it 's unfortunate .
such a disappointment !
no answer or no information .
what a waste of my time and theirs .
it surprises me that a business could run this awful .
that was not enough to justify the _num_ price tag .
i will not be back .
the areas used to get ready were small .
the locker areas were small .
the waiters that served our lunch were super nice .
the waiter at the spa pool on the other hand was a jerk .
do n't go on a holiday weekend !
only for both of them to leave once the spouse returned .
man , it was just a disaster .
we left early so we could sit down and have a drink .
but alas , a great massage does not make a spa .
unfortunately , i can not say the same of the fitness class .
the class was supposed to be _num_ min long .
i do n't think we got a total _num_ min workout .
we may have gotten _num_ min of actual workout on the surf boards .
the salad itself was a real let down .
the real reason for the low stars is that the treatments were mediocre .
it felt like too much wasted time .
this was not .
super disappointed with the customer service here .
scheduling appointments however , is anything but simple .
truly a shame because the facilities are so pretty .
they could bat a home run but fail to even get on base .
i just visited this spa yesterday and was not too happy .
we ended up having to spend a couple of hours apart .
i will not , however , ever return here for a pedicure again .
literally one of the worst spa experiences of my life .
i was too hungry by that point and disappointed by the subpar service .
my certificate was to include lunch as well as a glass of wine .
horrible customer service at the front desk .
horrible , horrible customer service .
i do not recommend this place .
sadly , the spa is nothing like it was .
could that have been put elsewhere ?
people seem less than friendly here and sorry to say have attitude .
i urge people to not go to this place .
they would never had said anything ... .
i am not impressed by this agency or their policies .
is n't that what is called doing business ?
`` have we offended you ? ''
we left wondering if we even want to go to europe .
now it 's just another greedy restaurant .
all _num_ times dr. howard never took a blood test !
i would never go back here , the vet is rude and arrogant .
overpriced and lacking in communication skills .
yes you heard right they did the work on the wrong tooth .
my husband ordered the halibut ( suggestion from waiter ) and it was overcooked .
he told him it was overcooked .
i would never go to this restaurant again .
skip the grill and drive _num_ minutes down to the white chocolate grill .
is it possible to go below _num_ star ?
seafood , even in arizona , should n't be this bad .
i was embarrassed for the chef .
i 've never walked out on a meal until eating at the grill .
one of my worst dining experiences .
do not waste your money here on a meal .
i am also from california and am always looking for good tart yogurt .
first off , the lady working there was rather stuck up .
she just stood there staring and would n't really answer any questions .
i would hardly say _num_ strawberries are worth _num_ .
as for the food , wow what a disappointment .
next we had some appetizers ... beef skewers and pan fried dumplings .
it was all breading and very little chicken to be found .
overall not a tasty plate at all .
we also ordered the szechuan shredded pork and this was just plain simple .
if jade palace were to open in ny it would close in a week .
so this place literally ruined christmas for us .
very disappointed !
the food was poor quality and fair at best !
do n't waste your time .
stay away unless you are a local who eats here all the time .
worst scottsdale service i have had in the past _num_ years .
ugh ... then please do n't offer thru yelp .
the only thing good was the rice .
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
if you know chinese food this is not it !
waste of money .
this place is really bad .
the food made me sick .
will not be back here .
again , i never once worked with an actual physical therapist .
she was suffering so bad i had to have her put down .
anyway , i lost my confidence in this place .
horrible , that 's how !
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
she is incredibly rude and had absolutely no personality .
slow at the register .
no self checkout lanes .
rotisserie chickens are not fully cooked .
the only good thing about this store is they have a starbucks !
no self check out .
the managers are helpful , especially keith .
very expensive and just ok .
chef did a better job though .
chicken and lamb were nicely done but vegetarian dishes were mediocre .
food , service , everything else is so average .
it was n't horrible , but i wo n't be back .
the waitress had suggested that i substitute half my rice for small greek salad .
oh and we never did get our refill on our tea ... .
this is not what you call service .
the chicken was good but the lamb was extremely tough and full of fat .
basmati rice was prepared fine , but still nothing special .
i did n't see or taste anything that would make me want to return .
save your money and visit another restaurant .
rude staff !
the food was shit , even the raspberry iced tea had no flavor .
the persian ice cream was delicious , it smelled like roses .
finally , my friend asked a waiter that we would like to order .
first , why do you need to get him .
you could have taken our order and then told our waiter .
my beer and my other friend 's ice tea arrived quickly .
but my other friend 's wine just didnt arrive .
but still no wine !
and no surprise because the wine was bad .
then as we chatted , with plates just sitting in front of us .
no apologies , no nothing .
i can not imagine this place when it is busy .
worst service ever !
to start , it took _num_ minutes to get greeted .
waiter was obnoxious and became extremely annoying as the evening went on .
not sure we will go back .
our dining experience was less than desirable & very disappointing .
save your money folks .
there are much better dining options in scottsdale !
the food was very bland .
the eggplant was gross and hard to even get on my fork .
the okra was mushy and flavorless .
my hubby had the veggie skewer and agreed it was very bland & tasteless .
not worth the price .
tonight was a disappointing dinner : - ( .
our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful .
overall a bad experience .
extremely disappointed .
four pieces of hard lamb ... and _num_ % of the dish jasmine rice .
seriously , i can cook persian food much better .
the waiter never checked on us .
who wants to be around someone after eating raw onions -- gross !
i was extremely underwhelmed .
the portions were good but it all went down hill from here .
the salad was extremely poorly cut and was difficult to eat because of that .
i have been visiting this restaurant since i moved to az .
lightly warmed up , and very cold from inside .
i was very disappointed and frustrated .
not even a small dish of desserts .
i 'm not gon na get into details .
i would 've taken back if i did n't live _num_ min north .
if you want persian , eat in house , not to go .
he did n't seem to care for his job .
this place has went down the drain .
ate her again and it is poor food , the service was reasonable .
its ridiculous .
its actually quite disgusting .
management : get a clue !
furthermore , they are a rip off restaurant .
refused for a to go order on new years eve .
if they do n't have enough catering why keep the restaurant open ?
restaurants ca n't refuse to take to go order .
it 's very bad service .
the manager refused to make more reservations , i 'm really disappointed .
arizona has let me down when it comes to american food .
i was thinking this must be the hot spot !
it was extra calories wasted .
this dish would of been better if they had garlic mixed with it .
the beef was not the best quality and was n't cooked to my liking .
the seasoning was off and it tasted like dry grilled beef .
this place has really taken a turn in the worst direction .
this was after the hostess quoted us _num_ minutes of wait time .
others seem to love this place , unfortunately my experience was n't the same .
i had their beef cubes & it was dry .
i could n't even finish my meal .
if you want good persian food , i would suggest going somewhere else .
our night was ruined and we made sure to leave asap .
first of all , they were packed .
things did n't go right from the get go .
this is a $ _num_ drink and my expectations were higher .
usually , it is piping hot .
this time it did n't seem so good .
the circumstances being that the restaurant was simply too crowded .
frankly , it did n't add much to the `` ambience . ''
i had never been here before and had heard wonderful things about it !
the ambiance was nice but everything else was downhill .
no manager came around to apologize during the whole time we were there .
the food was okay but nothing spectacular .
i will not be back and will instead go somewhere else for persian food .
nothing special .
went last night for valentine 's dinner , and was seriously disappointed .
after 30+ minutes of waiting , we were escorted to our table upstairs .
and that was a mess in itself .
but our requests for water and bread were so delayed .
just walked in , tried to order something to go .
i just walked out after a few minutes .
no stars here !
so sad to have had a negative experience here after so many good ones .
owner needs to do something about customer service- attitude is not professional .
it was n't , really .
original , i guess , is one way to put it .
service , overall , was spotty and a bit slow .
recently had dinner at the persian room .
the greek salad was served with a yogurt dressing .
we will return to the flaming kabob from now on .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would !
not family friendly !
this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced !
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
clueless staff led by a clueless manager .
i stopped in for lunch .
i expected the lunch portion at 1pm , since lunch is served until _num_ .
about _num_ ounces , if that .
_num_ ounces at most .
confusion of what servers had what table .
the chicken kabob my daughter ordered was pretty good .
i just picked out the properly cooked edges and left the rest behind .
disgusting .
it 's not because of the money it 's all about characters !
cox is pitiful .
two had customers , one was filing her nails .
lady # _num_ went to the back .
we came here because one of their overpriced boxes apparently failed .
juan way to drop the ball and refuse my calls for an explanation .
really not impressed with the service nor the wait times here .
to me , that is unacceptable .
we cancelled our tv service _num_ months ago .
we went into this store and talked to michael .
it must be a mistake .
_num_ dollars for internet only !
we cancelled our tv service _num_ months ago .
we went into this store and talked to michael .
it must be a mistake .
_num_ dollars for internet only !
it happens , i suppose .
cox is not your friend in the internet age .
they are not interested in quality of service .
so ... bye bye cox .
i called back and they were unable to fix it .
pool specially the jacuzzi is never clean enough .
i 've lived here _num_ weeks and it 's appalling to live here .
less than one star - i live here and the staff is terrible .
the staff is rude and far from helpful .
# _num_ the maintenance tickets dont get done for a long time .
# _num_ .
gross !
drinking smoking pot !
was informed _num_ months later !
everything was fine until something in your apartment breaks and needs to be fixed .
and when u would walk back in the apt it would smell like sewage .
it could b mold infested as we speak !
they do n't inform u each time they let themselves into a unit !
now do n't even get me started about the pool area !
are they doing background checks on these people like they do residents ?
starting july 1st alcohol will not be allowed in the pool area .
this season is not looking good .
but it started out rocky does n't mean anything because it stayed rocky !
it smells last nasty mold all over !
even no it 's still wet everywhere !
awkward !
this place is just short of a dump .
and maintenance _num_ hours ?
terrible management .
this should be the last place on your list to look at .
_num_ months of problems , in and out of the office .
within _num_ hours they would have our problem fixed .
overall , it has n't been the worst place we have lived .
however , we are happily leaving .
the walls and windows were so thin , you could hear everything outside .
which , was n't the first time cops were in the complex .
they did n't even realize he had passed until hours later .
i would n't recommend this place for many reasons .
the place was never cleaned .
we spent hours upon hours cleaning the apartment .
it was terrible .
everything about this apartment is cheap and dirty .
the tracks are so beyond disgusting !
our lease ends november and we ca n't wait to move !
do n't waste your time with this place !
the outside may look pretty but the inside is terrible !
it 's super noisy and inconvenient .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
on top of the horrible front office people .
no one at corporate or the front office care about anything going on .
literally the worst place i can think of to live .
refuses to replace outdoor lighting , making a dangerous place at night .
the new management is awful .
incredibly rude , and slow to fix issues .
however , he walked up to the front desk afterwards and demanded payment immediately .
so incredibly unprofessional , rude , and inappropriate .
dr. c has horrible customer service skills .
_num_ months later i ordered a pair of prescription sunglasses .
non prescription lenses worked much better .
sorry but we have no king bed rooms left .
sorry we ca n't refund you .
customer service is n't really that important to us .
not much to recommend it other than convenient location .
rooms are worn and need a remodel .
wallpaper peeling off of wall .
oh yea , and no chips .
if it does , they do not make exceptions even for lifetime platinum members .
i repeat , do not move here !
dead roach in the kitchen upon move in .
no package service -- website says they will accept packages .
do not rent here .
the people here are very nice but the corporate ethics are in the trash .
horrible management .
i think this manager is very sour about his life .
never smiles and has an attitude problem towards the residents .
so i replied with , why ?
go live somewhere where you 're treated with respect .
guess what , the office could care less !
the place is very out dated and the plumbing here is awful .
so many problems here !
do yourself a favor and do n't fall for it .
worst place i have ever lived !
i am moving out early just to get away from here .
management could care less and say they are doing what is required of them .
disgusting !
we could not wait to move out of there .
there are a lot of available units , there is a reason for that .
my problem with this place is their billing practices .
she just said sorry , no you have to pay the outstanding balance .
the staff does absolutely nothing except sit there .
place is a joke , and the bathrooms are nasty .
warning !
my problem is i never agreed to automatically billed payments .
it left a bad taste in my mouth .
the lack of consistent fees and policies has hurt my experience .
owner and manager attempted to charge my credit card with the additional fee .
they refused my cash and services .
he hung up on me on more the one occasion .
be very weary and go elsewhere .
this is a trainers gym .
i am disappointed .
i have been going for years but recently had a bad experience .
i really do n't get it .
i can not stand the chicken used in their salads .
the staff was not the friendliest and the atmosphere was drab .
our food arrived and it was nothing special either .
the salad and sandwiches we ordered were just average .
my son did n't like the cookie he ordered for dessert .
paying _num_ dollars for a sandwich is n't worth it .
i would n't go back .
how hard is it really to get someone 's name right ?
i said no , i did n't understand you old lady ... .
and she was even pointing her nasty old finger at me !
not nice customer service at all !
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
very bad customer service .
when i was filling out the tip portion , she started rolling her eyes .
bunch of clowns and i would steer clear of these guys .
i got in my car and drove off but i did n't like this .
horrible and rude people .
i said so the add is all bull crap ?
he is an a hole .
here is where it gets weird .
they offered me another deal with another bank at _num_ % interest .
i understand i was upside down on my vehicle , but this was ridiculous .
i became firm and said , they need to change their policies .
thumbs up for that .
i told him they were very important too .
i said to make sure they put full synthetic oil not synthetic blend .
after waiting almost _num_ hours this was very disappointing .
i will no longer be servicing my vehicle here .
poor service !
whatever u do , do not deal with aaron !
avoid this place !
i hate to give this place a _num_ star , but i have to .
i went in to buy a used kia soul .
but this whole situation was completely in the interest of making a sale asap .
i just left .
do not waste your time going to mark kia in south scottsdale !
omg , what a waste of time , lies and horrible customer service !
i did n't even get in .
this was a nightmare !
waited for about _num_ mins .
for the gentleman i had my appt .
first clue that i should have left .
left with a car that was not what i wanted .
not the options i wanted .
not the interest rate expected .
waited for the finance dept in a very dirty waiting room .
i would never reccomend mark kia to anyone , ever .
it was a horrible experience .
horrible experience at this dealership .
store manager and finance manager rude and unprofessional .
way too much to write in detail .
horrible experience from a repeat customer .
will never return again , or purchase another vehicle from mark kia .
some were fixed and some never were .
this was however the biggest mistake ever !
at no time did they tell me financing would be a problem .
i literally spent almost nine hours with this one transaction .
mark kia , your dealership is awful and i will never shop here again .
as for the staff , they are awful and uncaring at best .
do not get a car here !
i called the dealership and was told that this is standard .
if this is standard then i should have been told .
the kia road side assistance strongly advised me to stay with the vehicle .
i have been stuck for almost _num_ hours now .
they will also no be here for another two hours .
its a flat tire !
this should not be an all day event .
one of the worst car buying experiences i 've ever had , awful service .
finally , two weeks after that , nothing has been done .
just overall , bad .
so do n't waste your time going here !
potential used car buyers be warned .
none of the initial numbers that the salesman presented made any sense .
everything about the experience was terrible .
first of all they advertise _num_ oil change .
mine was _num_ .
so i agree to look at another vehicle and decide to purchase .
ca n't trust them avoid this place .
the salesman was very low pressure ; in fact he hardly talked .
knew nothing about the car , warranty , anything .
terrible experience .
not ideal , but not a deal breaker .
when we arrived , they were unable to locate the car in question .
understand , this is not a huge dealership .
that concept has apparently not reached scottsdale road .
one star but in reality they do n't even deserve one .
place is horrible and entire staff is clueless including their mechanics .
but only because i wanted the vehicle and payments were decent .
just kinda ridiculous .
an awful experience .
what a complete waste of my time .
if i could give zero stars i would .
terrible service and people .
just terrible .
do not trust a single salesman or manager at this dealership .
i wish zero stars was an option .
the horror begins after you drive off the lot .
steer clear , you can find better places to work with .
not professional at all !
i went to the store when they informed me of the bad news .
this just shows you how awful this place is .
bad company !
bad employees !
i repeat , do not buy a car from here !
i am a _num_ year old with not great credit .
granted i 've been working on it .
i got a _num_ honda civic .
so let 's skip ahead to the present .
i explained there is no way i can go over _num_ dollars a month .
we were so fed up that we walked out .
decided in the morning , i want this car i will do it .
wow ... what a horrible experience at this dealership !
do they really think that i am that dumb ?
mark kia could have at least done an oil change before selling the car .
they make a bad name for used car dealers .
i wish i would looked at these other yelp reviews before i went there .
anyway , there are too many other places to buy a used car .
do n't waste your time here .
he was not hurry up and get here today today today .
i was assured that there would be no problem .
however , i would run from buying anything there .
elsewhere where i got a comparable vehicle for the payment i asked for .
the trade i asked for and a _num_ % + less interest rate .
worse experience ever !
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
who know buying a car would be one of the most stressful experiences ever ?
_num_ weeks later i have my tags and can not find the plate .
called _num_ times and am assured i will be called back .
eventually i was - no luck on the plate .
bought a _num_ kia soul , horrible gas mileage i must say .
the sales practices are pretty typical of a dealer .
i am however very disappointed in how they presented the vehicle .
i probably would n't have bought the car had i known .
its not worth the headache .
sales rep knew nothing about the vehicle besides the very obvious .
truly ridiculous !
my experience there was just a huge waste of time !
if i could give them a zero i would .
they flat out lie to you .
and even then i am not sure .
the tow package is not an issue either .
we 'll remove you from our list as quickly as possible .
do not look back .
sales manager lies , and have email to prove it above .
most horrible used car buying experience of my life .
they should feel dirty at the way they sell a car .
the listed price is the price and then the regular taxes and fees .
there are plenty of reputable dealerships in phoenix !
he proceeds to try to talk us into financing .
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
like , just say you dont have what i want and move on .
dad got a cashiers check , we paid for it and drove away .
i could n't be happier .
way to go mark kia , your bs ways just lost you _num_ grand .
said they would have it out and ready to look at .
but since your here you might as well look around .
_num_ min drive for a vehicle i was assured was there and available .
will say they were friendly though .
no call backs or follow ups to update you on the process .
customer service is absent at this dealership !
but horrible customer service .
and can never get a hold of anyone .
left a message with name and number and never received a call back .
why 'd they let me make the appointment ?
why did they call and say my car was ready ?
the 2nd time was an oil change no issues .
why i ca n't choose zero star ?
they do n't deserve a star !
what a shame to have been to this store .
shame !
i am very upset that i wasted my time at this place .
it did n't reflect your business values .
because your value is you do n't care about your customers .
yeah , your customers are cheap and their time is cheap too .
you just get sick of sitting in a dealership .
he said he 'd check , but never returned .
once the vehicle was there the inside condition of the vehicle was horrible !
everything in it was either broke or just plain missing .
the pictures on the website showed no major issues with the interior at all .
the amount of money they were asking was unreasonable .
do n't bother wasting your time !
not professional at all .
so disappointed .
same money down , lower payments , better car , much better experience !
my partner and i do not know much about cars .
follow up with the gm has not been pleasant either .
i only managed to force down half of it .
plus , he said the meat was chewy and low quality .
each day that i enter scottsdale i die a little inside .
h & r block located at _num_ n scottsdale rd .
scottsdale , az _num_ .
after a little over an hour all was completed and filed .
at the end i was presented with a bill of nearly $ _num_ .
i painfully paid and was grateful to be done with it .
however , i was shocked to see the amount of the bill .
this is no longer the case .
i 'll never use them again .
the first time , i believed it was a mistake .
the second time makes me think that this is a habit .
ok , yes , the beer list is incredible .
ugh .
my so will have to get his papago fix on his own .
no fried food , no ranch , no business being a bar .
the beer , scene and employees deserve a higher rating .
it 's cheaper than four peaks , but in no way as good .
also , wait staff was slow and rude .
my friend said his beer was ok , so one star .
i think dog food right from the bag would be better .
i should have noticed because no one was eating .
too bad .
i keep going back to papago , hoping my dining experience will change .
i walk in and sit down , wait , then wait some more .
just last week my husband and i decided to try papago one last time .
he served our drinks quickly .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
they were rolling their eyes when he looked away and had bad attitudes .
i would much rather go out of my way and go to four peaks .
the only problem was , there was nobody behind the bar .
there was n't an employee to be found .
shortly after that , all of the employees came pouring out of the kitchen .
horrible , horrible experience .
im not that pushy .
but you blew it last night .
we ordered beer and beer bites .
one hour later , no beer bites and we had to leave .
you can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough ?
do i look stupid ?
specials are not mentioned .
wait time is long .
four peaks would get _num_ stars compared to this .
dumpy dive vibe as soon as you walk in .
bartenders were nice but seemed amateur .
wo n't be back .
there was n't one and they had forgotten to set any aside .
we ordered a pizza and it took _num_ hours to show up .
it was ok , but not worth the _num_ hour wait .
their food is not good .
he said sure no prob .
is this guy insane ?
i normally dont do that if you buy a beer ?
to my face none the less .
first off it does not stand out in anyway .
the decor is an old library mixed with a rundown dive bar .
not a fan .
not so great food and service .
i like the environment but it can get really noisy when busy .
the cheese sauce it came with did nothing for the dish .
the avocado slices on the salad were not ripe and were rock hard .
the worst part was the bacon .
i would n't recommend this place .
the bar has n't been cleaned in who knows how long .
this was a terrible experience !
it was hard to find , and should have stayed hidden .
i sat down at a table and started browsing through the menu .
she never even came back to give me a bill .
i have never had service so bad before .
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
it is not like they were slammed or anything , just poor service .
i unfortunately will not be back due to this experience .
do n't like this review ?
take it up with your consistently bad servers -- enough people have consistently complained .
i want to like this place but i just do n't .
this is my third time here and everytime service has been slow at best .
do n't know where to begin .
service was very slow .
crap , crap , crap .
it was saturday 1:30 pm .
after a _num_ minute wait we received our food and the sliders were meatball .
on the bill she did change the charge to meatball ... .
the bill was $ _num_ and not worth half that .
all in all , it was disappointing .
immediately when we walked in and had a horrible feeling about this place .
awful ambiance and bad location .
the music playing was 50s music which does n't make sense for a bar .
eventually she did and she was very rude .
terrible experience here this afternoon .
get some to go or elsewhere because the service here is bullshit .
no worries though , we just wanted to grab a couple beers .
the servers were inattentive the entire stay but were very friendly .
we did n't order any food so i ca n't comment on that .
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
had a hop not and did n't even finish it .
could n't wait to leave .
disappointed .
i was greatly disappointed .
after we got our appetizer and drinks , our server abandoned us .
disgusting .
i 'm not sure i can return after that discovery .
as they say , bad pizza is still good pizza .
long story short : come here for beer , not food .
we had places to be so unfortunately , i left hungry .
the staff is rude and not very intelligent .
you 're probably better off going around the corner to the british open pub .
food is way below average .
tastes like everything came from a packages or was frozen _num_ minutes before serving .
a vintage guitar .
missing the board .
my bored mother in law .
i 'm sorry .
it was hard to stick around and peruse the material past of strangers .
do n't make me .
this place needs more than one or _num_ check out counters .
the selection of hot fish and shrimp dishes were more than normal .
unfortunately there was not really anything else i could get excited about .
soon as i walked in at 3pm the people seemed sort of rude .
i was so hungry i didnt care .
they charged me $ _num_ which thought was high .
everything at the buffet was just awful .
this place is horrible .
the sushi was worse than the stuff you buy from the grocery store .
the teriyaki was dry .
there is nothing that would ever get me to come back to this place .
i hate , hate , hate choosing from old nail polish colors .
i should n't have a better selection at home .
this is a wide spread problem among nail salons .
i have even walked out because of it .
the massage chair next to me had an upside down chair in it .
i could also smell the stench of sewage , not a comforting feeling .
these few things made the place seem unclean .
also , i am naturally blonde , as in i have no eyebrows .
what were they going to do , wax them off ?
i have to fill in , not take away .
this is definitely not a place i would recommend .
the lady giving me my pedicure cut me twice !
although the owner was very friendly the lady giving me my mani/pedi was rude .
i will definitely not be going back .
little did i know that wait time was for me .
they pass up a lot of business people won ' [ t wait .
i was not impressed at all .
( is n't that standard for a pedicure ?
i really needed it done so i obliged .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
i felt like that was unfair , very , very unfair .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
this has to be the worst nail spa in arizona !
it was so awful i did n't even let the lady polish my toes .
i walked out .
i left the store and went straight to another nail salon .
i never received such a horrible pedicure in my life .
i ca n't even call it a pedicure .
sad because they have a nice location but the wrong staff .
they screwed up my nails .
the tech could n't get my gel polish off .
needless to say my nails were breaking within a week .
not satisfied and will not be returning .
i could not cut the rack of ribs with a steak knife !
with all of our spring training choices ... to give them money was criminal .
in all , this is not my type of place .
no stars for the tired , drab & dusty interior .
very disappointed .
needs a complete interior update overhaul and face lift .
needless to say we will never go back there !
not worth the money in any way !
this review is purely about the poor service experienced at this legendary location .
that was enough to get our party of five to get up and leave .
the service was lousy , main tv was out , management could care less .
simply put overrated .
my steak was almost rare , i asked for med well .
the only thing good was fast service .
i guess it does n't take long to cook a rare steak .
i hate writing bad reviews , but this place missed the mark several times .
i made reservations for 6:30pm on a monday night .
either way the service was not good .
our appetizer was also cold , and not even good .
how do you mess up potato skins ?
went here last friday and was wondering if i would ever get served .
a half hour food ticket is sad .
was n't fantastic .
it made my stomach hurt .
the inside of the restaurant felt sleazy and i definitely would not return here .
when she walked away they left .
we left shortly after .
needless to say service was horrific and environment felt like a strip club .
does n't matter anyway , this place is now permanently closed .
i hate jamba attitude .
i had almost forgotten how much i do n't really care for jamba juice .
also , most of their menu items are n't really that healthy .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
i generally like this location , however today the staff changed that .
no one smiled or seemed upbeat .
the smoothie itself was awful tasting .
it did not taste fresh or sweet .
walked in and stood at the counter to order .
i walked out .
thanks for nothing , jamba juice .
this was by far the worst jamba juice store i have been to .
as a _num_ year old that is a big deal for me .
far worse however was the service .
i would not eat here again as there are far better options nearby .
rude customer service !
definitely not worth the wait though .
terrible customer service .
my friend i recently went here to eat .
if you ask me it was unprofessional and unsanitary .
i will not be eating at this location again .
what a horrible experience .
_num_ of us total .
another _num_ minutes pass food finally arrives .
burger had little to no frys .
requested more fry 's we never received .
no refills we 're ever given .
both servers could of cared less if we were in the building .
had to go track down the server to get our bill .
the worst service !
horrible customer service !
terrible to-go service !
two times in a row , my order has been completely wrong .
the first time i was missing an entire sandwich and a side of fries .
i will not be doing business with this location again !
dear manager hire more cooks wow one hour wait .
fairly busy , sunday morning after church .
waited about _num_ minutes , no big deal .
horrible service !
mashed potatoes came out dry as all hell no manager in the building ... .
makes it hard to call and place an order ... called _num_ times .
poor customer service poor attitude all around poor experience .
nasty place .
i would not recommend going here .
he gave me no refund and accepted no responsibility for the problem .
i do not recommend anyone going to this place !
the photo i took proved useful in catching this shop in a huge lie .
worst experience ever here !
i 'll never go back and deal with this shady place .
the place is always crowded !
he looked at me like i did it or something .
not even in another state .
he listens to me but looks at me like i am lying .
i have not even seen the facilities !
what is so wrong with me getting a _num_ day pass ?
no thanks la fitness !
hiding the free weights is n't a fun game .
liar , liar , pants on fire .
fat trainers .
other than that , it 's awesome .
_num_ ) sales staff is extremely pushy .
no , i just want to work out .
_num_ ) parking is a pain in the rear .
not a big fan .
never , i repeat , never go after 4pm .
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
this past weekend , the mcdowell location of la fitness hosted a vip event .
whoever thought up this event gets no stars , in my opinion .
for me , going to the gym does n't equal social hour .
idiots .
edit : i had to knock this place down a star .
i feel like it has gotten even worse recently .
it 's like people think it 's hand soap and do n't touch it .
is this gym gross , dirty and smelly ?
it 's close to me , it 's cheap and there 's no contract .
ugh it gets so busy during the peak hours .
ive had to wait for a cardio machine several times .
parking can be really annoying too .
thank god for places like _num_ hour fitness .
can you say worst gym ever ?
do not go to this la fitness , or any other for that matter .
very shady practices here .
do n't be fooled .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
it only gets worse .
i went online and it was literally impossible to cancel that way .
i told them that this was not possible .
( i assume .
oh , the kicker : the email said i still owe them $ _num_ .
however , nowhere on the pass did it state any of these restrictions .
equipment looks outdated as well .
no towel service .
desperately need to update their equipment .
hard to believe this gym is in scottsdale .
afternoon eye candy very weak .
this place sucks and the staff are rude !
that 's what i was expecting when i walked in .
that 's not what happened .
i walked in and told them i had a guest .
excuse me ?
no , i 'm sorry .
the customer service here sucks .
you might even lose me .
seriously , avoid talking to staff here !
if you are a committed fitness freak - avoid this place .
i did n't let them waste another second of my time .
cost was n't an issue for me in any way , shape or form .
you may want to revisit your sales techniques la fitness .
horrible idea !
he said he would have to grab the store manager to assist us .
then secondly he was completely lacking what makes a business , customer service !
the gym as a whole is just grimy .
rude .
a week passed and i never received such confirmation .
monday came and obviously i was never contacted .
needless to say i will not be coming back .
machines are constantly breaking and weeks before repaired .
still broken .
a week later ( today ) , still broken .
in short , i was told no , no , and no .
i spent several phone calls and over an hour trying to get it resolved .
if something breaks it usually takes a couple weeks before the machine is fixed .
equipment is in decent shape , but it is rather crowded .
they are worse than bally 's was .
i 'm sure they will suffer the same fate .
however on this occasion i did n't make it past the front desk .
sucks , because this is the closest gym to where i work .
oh well , off to see if planet fitness is any better .
they would apologize and say it would be handled in 5-10 business days .
after _num_ months i lost my cool and they transferred me to the corporate .
this place is full of incompetent con artist !
poor service .
i 'm having a hard time getting to like this place .
that 's the only reason i gave it that second star .
i will never recommend this gym to anyone .
needless to say i was extremely angry .
incredibly underwhelming .
scan your own self in , whatever .
i paid _num_ down and _num_ a month or something like that .
look , it 's cheap .
people never wipe them down .
_num_ ) the locker rooms are dirty .
no cleaner used .
_num_ ) no free wi-fi .
_num_ ) .
overall , disappointing gym .
could be so much better !
worst .
dirty dirty dirty !
they have _num_ basketball for court .
staff said b/c they 've been stolen .
wasted space of _num_ squash courts !
a cycle room that is _num_ % empty .
aside from be super dirty and expensive the staff is rude .
im was so embarrassed to even bring a guest there .
i was very disappointed .
i 'm dropping my membership and i will never go back .
not going to point out names , but the sales manager is a jerk .
all my friends pay much less here than what i was offered .
it is terrible and i do not recommend this gym .
this is not the gym for you .
if you have a membership trip another la fitness .
virtually all of which were in use .
no _num_ lb .
difficult to even walk , much less use equipment .
very unpleasant sales associates .
very creepy !
i wo n't get into details .
_num_ % of that inventory comes from these `` new '' owners .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
avoid this einstein 's at all cost .
based on the staff that day , it does not surprise me one bit .
i would recommend starving over going here .
for starters , this location is not set up very efficiently .
jumping forward , the bagels are really , really boring .
it 's not their fault really , but sad nonetheless .
this location is awful !
horrible customer service .
not one employee smiled at us or greeted us .
this being said , i was extremely dissapointed in this location .
the entrance is awkward and they are usually understaffed .
unfortunately i would have to sum up my experience as crappy both times .
are you kidding me ?
i 'll start by saying i used to love einstein 's .
for fear of food poisoning , i did n't eat it .
it 's obvious the employees do n't care about the customers or the service .
i 'm not a fan of this walgreens for a few simple reasons .
the old lady at the checkout is extremely rude !
the manager is ever more rude !
worst one around !
what !
instead of driving home i decided to wait in my car .
i was feeling terrible .
this made me wonder what she 'd been doing for the last hour .
is n't that the whole point of having a drive-thru ?
boy , was i wrong !
this place was terrible !
they did n't have any quality items for sale .
all of their stuff was junk .
besides the lack of product , the service here was terrible as well .
this experience would never have happened at their vegas stores .
i live within two blocks .
not so easy .
i did n't even eat it .
after placing my order of their `` new '' bacon swiss chicken sandwich .
i just was n't happy with the service i received here .
and they only get the second star because of the service department .
just not worth it .
and they were not pleasant to deal with .
i was not happy with the service department .
talk about torture .
i sat back down and another _num_ minutes go by .
are you kidding me ?
i stated in the survey exactly what i stated here on yelp .
worst car buying experience i ever had !
i tried to make it easy by paying sticker price .
it only got worse .
i 'm still waiting on my 2nd key .
he tells me , it came in but it was the wrong key .
i wait a couple more weeks , hear nothing and call again .
a week passes , no key , no phone call .
do not go to volvo of tempe !
total nightmare !
finance tries to bend you over .
the only other volvo dealership in town is much worse .
service department is the worst of any luxury brand !
this is by far the worst service .
i never heard back from them , so i called them a week ago .
but ac still not working properly .
should they not have checked before they gave me the car back ?
it 's pitiful really .
this place is a ripoff .
they quoted a price for a problem and fixed it .
scam , inflated prices , work not done on time .
this place is dishonest !
and that is just the part , add another _num_ for `` labor '' .
so , the work was not done on time and i was way overcharged .
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
for $ _num_ you do n't even get the dryer !
this is the worst car wash i 've ever been to .
will be going to another car wash .
absolute waste of money !
firstly it would n't take my debit card .
then it would n't take my cash .
absolute shit .
worst car wash ever ... can i just give no stars ?
anyway i should have just left after the change machine too my money .
this car wash sucks !
i have been here three times and left angry each time .
no more chances for them .
took my money , nothing .
no attendant .
at least try to pretend to give a darn .
i 'm the only car here .
really disappointed in the experience i had tonight .
when questioned , the employee was incredible rude to us .
extremely disappointed .
i will not be bringing my business back here .
okay , so i 'm not gon na `` review '' this sonic .
i mean , it 's a sonic .
it 's either drive-thru or walk-in , like any other fast food place !
sorry ( this ) sonic , but i 've experienced better .
so sad that the old sonic is not around scottsdale .
no refills on drinks you have to buy another drink .
staff is not very nice and hate the drive thru .
will not go back .
because its the only place open to get an ice cream float .
consistently wrong orders even when asked to repeat the order back .
after _num_ pm , no shot .
uh , uh , you mean the store manager ?
your products are not horrible but your service is the worst .
total lack of caring .
it was gross .
all together this was just terrible service ... .
this place does horrible work .
they 're looking to rip you off - not help you out .
do not take your car here even for an oil change .
i wish there was a negative star because that 's all this company deserves .
i recently brought my car to them and explained my problems and concerns .
they drove it and told me they were n't sure what the problem is .
but for $ _num_ they could tear the transmission apart and let me know .
i am a single mom of _num_ little ones and make very little .
i 'm so glad i went and had a second opinion .
however , this experience went pretty smooth .
no thanks .
um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
he says my coolant is low .
i do n't believe it .
why would something be wrong with my car all of a sudden ?
that just sounds like complete b.s .
i will never return to this jiffy lube .
my experience here was unpleasant .
despite my stating - i do not want anything above a standard oil change .
$ _num_ dollars for a standard oil change ?
i was n't going to pay for that .
i quite possibly will never go to another jiffy lube .
i do n't mind paying extra for convenience but that 's a little ridiculous .
sad that there is no local contact to express my concerns ... .
this takes me about _num_ minutes on a honda car .
horrible .
it was interesting but not that exciting .
overpriced , greasy , and not really that british .
avoid this , pay less and get better food in tempe , at rula .
a lil disappointed with the place .
the beer was definitely overpriced , as was their shots .
we all had different things , and the food was greasy and gross .
i do not recommend this place and i wo n't be back .
the food is typical english food , heavy and greasy .
in england they do n't serve nachos .
have n't eaten here in a while , i 'm usually in for drinks .
the chips had an `` old oil '' taste .
served with choice of peas or slaw , and tartar and ketchup .
worth _num_ bucks , but not near _num_ .
the beer on tap is super cold !
they came out with _num_ small containers of hot mustard , which i love .
they are not sausage rolls anymore but _num_ or _num_ slices of one .
my wife and i came in for lunch on a friday afternoon .
the service was very slow .
i had the fish and chips .
the fish came out very soggy and chips were soggy as well .
this came very dry as well .
i know my friends like this place .
the waitress said it was n't .
no paper towels in the bathroom .
not impressed with the onion rings ... too greasy with an unpleasant aftertaste .
they had very little sauce and were overly unimpressive .
flavorless and crunchy , yes , crunchy .
i would suggest they remove these off their menu .
its not for the faint of heart though .
service needs severe work .
and it was n't immediate either .
plenty of other places in the area to direct your hard earned money towards .
sorry guys , yet , not really sorry .
this has just been consistently disappointing .
they were very rude and took forever .
the bartender did n't even know what channel it was on .
no one else in the pub seemed to care either .
change your name if you do n't even have the british open on !
this was by far the worst experience i 've had .
the man in charge said they normally wo n't replace scratched tint .
clearly their aggressive pricing comes with poor quality work .
it is not a quiet complex .
so i guess they are not roaches .
bad .
and fairly empty .
no cell reception !
few people get cell phone reception in our 1st floor apt .
it does n't feel clean .
ick .
maintenance staff is rude and ca n't be bothered .
overpriced dirty units with old inefficient appliances .
it was an overall unpleasant experience in the one year i lived here .
there are a bunch of native american 's that frequent this establishment .
not much to say about this old little hole in the wall .
horrible customer service .
i was originally told _num_ days .
i am never using them again !
( took _num_ days to do a simple bumper hood repair . )
so i am going back for a third time at getting my car back .
i left a message almost _num_ hours prior expecting a prompt call in return .
to no avail .
waste of time going here .
she made my day even worse then it was !
they also refused to cover the damage they did !
would absolutely never recommend .
poor experience so far .
progress is being made and we should have our call by the weekend .
another man was also waiting , at the hot chicken dinners to go area .
... because you will not find that here .
filling , somewhat greasy and cheap !
no thanks , i took my business to fiesta burrito .
poor service is my pet peeve , no matter where it is found .
i got stomach upset after i ate their carne asada burrito .
figured i 'd try a chorizo and egg burrito .
i was wrong .
wrong .
while i waited for my food , i went to load up on salsa .
i tried the spicy salsa and the roasted peppers salsa .
there was very little flavor to it .
ok , another bite ... .
however , that did n't help with the flavor at all .
as a matter of fact , i only ate 1/2 of it .
overall , it was a very disappointing dining experience .
i will never give them my business again .
the food is bland .
i 've given it many chances and each time they get my order wrong .
bland , bland , bland .
i 'm sad to say that super burrito `` fell off '' .
i felt so bad , i cooked up something for her at home .
the food is okay but there drive thru is hell !
i could n't remember why i stopped coming .
no check in or explanation from workers about length of time .
so no breakfast for me until i can go for lunch .
purchased a number _num_ meal beef taco with enchilada and beans and rice .
spent about _num_ to $ _num_ on all this food .
currently waiting for my food in the drive thru .
used the drive-thru so i ca n't comment on the cleanliness .
however , do we tip at taco bell ?
the bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty .
i wish i would have eaten the taco first and skipped the bean burrito .
i ordered the _num_ fried tacos .
if i go back i 'd would try a different dish .
a rare yelp disappointment !
the rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans .
my carne asada was rubbery and just average at best .
quality is bad but again , i dont expect much out of these places .
not impressed , the burritos were small , lukewarm , and sort of bland .
i feel like i tasted more tortilla than meat .
i tried the chicken , carnitas , and carne asada burritos .
they must have changed that recipe ... one part salsa with _num_ parts water ?
its awful !
the customer service is nonexistent !
it 's extremely awkward !
it was definitely not worth the price at all .
i know regulars would agree .
why does this place have such good reviews ?
we drove through and the order was wrong .
no flavor whatsoever .
everything was very very plain .
not impressed .
i would n't recommend it .
i am a bit bummed at the wasted food and money .
the food was bland , flavorless .
ugh messed up my night .
in fact , the _num_ stars represent the value per dollars of the food .
_num_ stars for this place is insane .
az people - you know better mex food !
i came here on a whim today with a craving for mexican food .
the inside of the restaurant was dark , quiet , and unappealing .
avoid this place at all cost .
fiesta burrito is meh .
as an arizona native i 'm picky with my mexican food .
i did n't like the burrito at all , unfortunately .
the carnitas , however , was dry and fatty .
i could n't even chew through some bites .
i 'm not really surprised with my experience at fiesta burrito .
it 's cheap and quick and similar to most fast food mexican joints .
carne asada had almost no flavor or char ( appeared to be boiled ?
which they attempted to mask with guac and pico .
beans and rice were sub par and bland as well .
the only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive .
i wo n't be coming back .
even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland .
star _num_ : how were the portions relative to the cost ?
stars _num_ and _num_ : how was the food ?
however , the goods essentially stopped there .
the eggs were bland , the cheese basic , and the steak questionable .
not good .
, which was really disappointing .
no stars granted .
star _num_ : would you eat here every day if you could ?
no star granted .
my husband and i have been going here for _num_ yrs .
i didnt even take a bite out of it .
nasty , i will not be coming here again .
the surrounding area is very dark and a bit hard to see .
the burrito was n't bad , but was a bit bland .
nothing really stood out for me .
not impressed .
would n't go back .
nothing really seemed to go together .
one had dried mustard or melted cheese all over the back of it .
it 's kind of rude .
we could have dealt with the food going downhill and the prices going up .
but not the horrible treatment .
it did n't seem very professional .
it felt chaotic and rushed .
ok , i 've only been once .
the gf and i were in search of a happy hour in the area .
big disappointment .
service was slow and it was n't even busy .
whatever it was , we wo n't be going back .
the one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers .
my corona was $ _num_ and the bud lights were $ _num_ .
it made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership .
what a really weird group of people here .
i did n't really care for the food .
i highly doubt i will ever be back to this weird ass place !
when and if it is busy , the waitresses are n't always attentive .
most if the time it is slow .
when we got there , it was pretty empty .
there were _num_ other tables that had people .
the staff was nowhere to be found .
the chili dog was bland .
i ate it all because i was starving , but the chili tasted weird .
when we left though he said it was bad .
so it 's busy and loud with all the traffic .
i never saw her taking a drink order .
attended a going away party on the patio .
there were _num_ servers who occasionally made their way to the patio .
she also got the order wrong .
the drink my wife ordered was watered down .
the steak tacos were passable , though i 've had better from del taco .
i 'm not even kidding .
third time back here service was horrible .
this place has the worst service you can imagine !
what makes me angry is the waitress not telling me i was being charged .
i always worry this place will go out of business .
this place is horrible .
terrible meat department , limited selection of produce .
honestly i would give this place zero stars .
unfortunately , i ca n't agree with the other reviewers here .
i will no longer ever come here again !
rude !
terrible !
my first visit was pretty standard .
this is where things got bad .
that happened _num_ times in about two hours .
horrible customer service !
and way over spent of this repair .
very very sad to have encountered this experience here .
he gave me the coupon !
the guy known as `` little brandon '' here totally screwed me over .
all of this was supposed to be installed at my 8am appt today .
so i showed up and nothing was ready to go .
do n't bring your car here for anything other than an oil change .
they might even screw that up too , not joking .
worst experience ever .
totally rude behavior , i guess they have too many customer .
i can help , i will never go back again .
if you want your order to be correct , call another franchise .
i hate hate hate this pizza hut !
this experience really made me appreciate quality chicken wings from just about anywhere else .
gross wings do not order !
she 's just not very bright .
is zero stars an option ?
when the pizza arrived it was cold .
this has to be one of the worst experiences of my life .
the driver could n't get into my gate with my code .
still sadly disappointed in this location , i 've never been so let down .
i 've posted a picture if you 're not convinced .
wow ... who would 've thought ordering a pizza could ruin your night .
you would have thought i was his long lost enemy .
i can not believe how rude he was just to create an order .
i never leave reviews and i am fairly patient person but wow .
the pasta is disgusting .
it came out very overcooked .
and apparently you do n't get marinara sauce with your bread sticks .
terrible customer service .
_num_ thumbs down for this location .
place sucks .
i 'm not upset , i 'm just extremely disappointed .
they tell me it 's going to be 30-40 minutes for delivery .
extremely unhappy with this place .
i have never experienced anything like this in my _num_ years of chiropractic care .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
he said i bought this on sale so there 's no returns .
a picture says it all .
big mistake !
our mistake was not going down there to see their stock !
but their inventory was questionable !
i wo n't go back .
very disappointed .
i had to follow up in person at the nursery to state my concerns .
appalling .
the owner was terribly rude and spoiled it .
are you kidding me ?
not that i would ever be crazy enough to give them my business again .
i spent over $ _num_ at their store within a month .
terrible customer service !
do n't give this guy your business !
very bizarre experience .
this is where it got weird .
all while this was going on , an old man ( barry himself ? )
all while the old man stood guard over the whole affair .
barry 's however , did n't do this .
is there a negative star option ?
but he did n't say we were done .
walked outside , and he was on his cell phone smoking a cigarette .
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
so here i am , letting yelpers know about my experience with them .
when i went back with my wife , the treatment was completely different .
i do n't know why i came to eat here .
i ordered _num_ loaded potato grilled but received _num_ .
these guys had no idea how to fix the washer .
and fixed the washer in _num_ minutes .
service call was $ _num_ .
he looked at my refrigerator and immediately found the problem .
no worries , i will call back at 8:00 .
no call back .
no answer and it went to voice mail .
advice to companies , answer your phone or return your calls .
very bad service .
do not us this business you will be sorry .
this is not how you do business .
_num_ weeks later i called and he said he had n't gotten to it .
i would not recommend that anyone take any sort of equipment here .
they had it almost _num_ yrs .
i handed over $ _num_ and brought it home .
they had n't even looked at it !
i will never step foot here again .
fortunately that has not happened yet .
i dragged my friends here kicking and screaming .
the pancakes were disgusting and bland .
i would n't even think of it .
large and in charge baby .
disgusting food , disgusting desserts .
those , well ... those were pretty awesome .
sick is the only word to describe .
the stuff looks like its been sitting there since _num_ .
dirty plates , silverware , walls , floors , everything !
coke was out , ice ran out , cups ran out .
never again , hometown .
ick ick ick .
food is watered down , greasy , soggy , and bland .
methinks not is completely an accurate statement .
i know i was here years ago and it was not bad .
but , oh my god !
run , do n't walk .
i never like buffet 's but this is horrible .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
how the mighty have fallen .
time was this buffet was plentiful with good choices .
the pastas were cold except the mac and cheese which was tolerable .
then someone comes and does not even great us .
once paid we look at the selection and where very disappointed .
the food was very bland to just awful .
i have been to other hometown locations , this one was the worse .
horrible mistake .
everything looked like it came straight out of a can .
it was horrible .
it seriously looked like a crime scene .
i would never go there again .
the food is as bad as all the reviews here say .
and yes , the bathrooms are as disgusting as other reviewers have mentioned .
this is a disgrace to the word , food .
the dining room needs a major overhaul .
my double cheese burger and medium fries were trash worthy .
slow service and occasionally rude people working .
pretty much worse experience i 've had with mcdonald 's .
play area was ridiculously hot seems like ac was n't working .
and customer service was not very good .
will not be returning .
worst mcdonald 's ever !
the people are rude and do n't speak good english .
hell if i know !
do n't go here unless you 're ok with mediocre service and terrible management .
sometimes i think they ca n't be serious but i guess i thought wrong .
it will be in _num_ minutes .
i 'm getting my breakfast smoothie !
it will be in _num_ minutes .
this is too close to my house so i 'll be back .
came at _num_ am and there was one person eating .
hmm , something wrong with this one ?
the burger confused him , i guess because it normally comes in a meal .
had to wait _num_ minutes for a burger and fries .
not good service there either .
too messy .
as i walked to the counter , my shoes stuck to the floor .
nasty !
not professional .
too bad .
these guys are way too inconsistent .
even the district manager would n't return my call about terrible service .
i wo n't be back ... mcdonalds right down the road from me !
i could have had a cookie .
went to redeem a birthday coupon .
do n't give this dq your business .
rude gentleman this exact visit .
unfortunately , after that it is just ok .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
$ _num_ for _num_ people and no cocktails .
i have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before .
i was craving it .
it looked dry and over cooked .
how do you screw up steak this bad ?
i am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down .
the food was below average and the prices high .
do not waste your time or $ $ $ there .
happy hour was dreadful .
i did not dig the crowd either , not a very happening place .
i 'm comparing it to other seafood restaurants period .
this to me was very disappointing .
nope , only appetizers at the bar .
no salads either .
so unfortunately , my first experience was not so good .
with $ _num_ for a _num_ 1/4 lb .
instead we received dishes that ranged from ok to awful .
the escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic .
if he visits the salt cellar his first stop should be the kitchen .
it was the most disgusting place we have been too .
the soda 's were flat and tasteless .
my halibut was under cooked and fishy tasting .
this place gives scottsdale a bad name for quality restaurants .
any tourists from out of state , , stay away from here .
long story short , i was disappointed with all of those .
both our dishes were just ok ... not worthy of the price .
but i wo n't be back .
hubby had a _num_ lb .
they have absolutely no idea how to make a dirty martini !
not needed at all , the place was empty .
such mediocre food .
even with the groupon it was way too much $ for what we got .
i recently dined here for a special occasion .
i will not be dining here again .
wow , were we wrong !
it certainly can not be found at the salt cellar .
the meal started with bread , which was meh .
a seafood place that does n't serve sourdough ?
the bread was very plain , even though one slice had olives in it .
for an appetizer , we chose crab cakes .
pretty mediocre for $ _num_ .
it was over cooked , mushy , and tasted old .
the hollandaise tasted like plain butter .
pretty bad , but still a little edible .
disgusting .
i did n't eat any more of it .
our waiter did n't even raise an eyebrow .
either it 's poor service or it happens all the time .
for a meal this quality , save your money and go to red lobster .
i could not have been more wrong .
my husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables .
i have never payed _num_ drinks not included for food that was so terrible .
unless of course you like bland inedible food .
go to red lobster you 'll have a better meal at less money .
good service , but below average food .
unfortunately , it made our experience a disappointment and we wo n't be back .
i figured the _num_ stars were just people being cheap well i was wrong .
shrimp toast : lots of flavor and that flavor was salt .
this was the worst trout i have ever had .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
food , absolutely horrible .
my expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood .
after all , they were charging _num_ bucks for a ribeye .
veggies , blah .
we were disappointed at the decor -- or the lack of it .
salad was drowned in dressing .
the price of the dinners simply does not justify the quality of the experience .
we gave it a _num_ out of _num_ .
wo n't be going back .
no way !
they will get no money from me .
rude , rude , manager .
this restaurant is way over priced for the quality of food presented .
no redeeming value for anything on the plate .
it 's not worth the walk downstairs .
it was n't very good .
i very disappointed considering the reputation they have .
i would not come here again .
if i could give less than one , i would .
baked stuffed clams , hot and the stuffing was bone dry !
$ _num_ for a bread basket that you get for free everywhere else ?
the salads we ok garden salad nothing special .
the lobster meat was very sweet but again fell flat on the seasonings .
for desert we had the chocolate lava cake .
what a disappointment !
for seafood there is a lot to be desired !
sad indeed for a seafood restaurant that should be better than the rest .
us and i use that term lightly was dale .
i am thinking its time for mr personality to get another job .
seriously , my baked stuffed shrimp was overcooked .
my husbands halibut did n't seem like halibut at all .
our third party had lobster and clams and he thought it was terrible .
rich food does not mean good food .
i ordered the lobster and steamed clams , and the clams were very good .
the lobster on the other hand could only be described as disgusting .
rude & arrogant people !
they completely ruined it and made no effort to correct it .
i 'll be sure to spread the word about your establishment .
this restaurant was horrible !
the vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance .
how do you screw up a baked potato ?
the dessert , chocolate lava cake , was n't even good .
but i have given it several tries and i just ca n't recommend it .
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
so is your stuff any good ? ''
but really bland '' .
at which point he walked away , never to be heard from again .
everybody says the economy sucks .
cocktail was so bad we had to send it back .
i was so disappointed with the salt cellar .
my hubby had the scallops and lobster which were average at best .
my husband and i went to the salt cellar for our anniversary .
it kind of ruined the entire evening .
needless to say , we will not be returning .
the food is abysmal , way past dated .
if i could give this restaurant zero stars i would .
it was that bad .
it was like taking $ _num_ and burning it in front of me .
i though this was decent of them .
the group of us tried several items .
the lobster , i was told was o.k but nothing to rave about .
my sister and i also split the crab legs and filet .
unfortunately , this is where things take a different direction .
let me just say , money is not the issue here .
it was just , eh .
i wish i could give salt cellar zero stars .
two rounds of drinks and about _num_ minutes later , we are seated .
was extremely rude about it , too .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
told me i was wrong and we need to leave .
the food was out dated and over cooked .
way to own up to your mistake .
unfortunately we had to learn this tasteless lesson on such a special night .
good seafood does not happen in the desert .
i ordered the swordfish with mango salsa .
the mango was very tart and overall bland .
my husband had the salmon oscar which is served over bread pudding .
salads served with the entree were boring and even the dressing could not help .
we were truly disappointed .
if this place was in chicago it would lose business to red lobster !
the wait staff was attentive .
anyway , just a disappointment .
i first ate at the salt cellar as a child with my parents .
seemed dank .
seemed depressing and old .
he sent it back , and it came back the same way .
finally he just ordered straight bourbon .
my fianc had oysters and i had halibut ceviche .
the ceviche had a very sour taste and was loaded with red peppers .
i could n't finish it .
nasty !
no lemon flavor .
it was just bad !
too much sauce and it was just awful !
the baked potato was decent .
i felt sick from the nasty hollandaise so we got the check and left .
disappointing !
salt cellar is stuck in the past and in need of a makeover .
too bad .
not impressed .
its dark , dated and overrated .
seriously dont waste your money .
the food was bland and did not seem fresh .
ok that was just the tip of the iceberg .
did not get bread until main course and several requests .
we topped off our own wine glasses every time .
our table was a mess .
plates would n't get cleaned off unless i asked .
and do n't order a cappuccino because it 's definitely asking for too much .
the salmon was fresh but bland .
to pour salt on an open wound , this bland dinner cost a fortune .
salads were pretty bad with just iceberg lettuce .
the broccoli was very undercooked ( think chain saw ) .
overall , not a good spot for foodies .
ok ... trying to breath here .
zero seasoning and over cooked .
my girl friends steak and crab legs were bad as well .
do not bother to order anything that is not prepared as steamed or boiled .
disgusting .
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
as we sent everything back , seriously inedible .
worst sea food in phoenix .
and then ten years later ... still lousy .
baked potato and mixed vegetables as a side , again - unimpressive .
seared blackened ahi , quality was good , blackened seasoning was way too salty .
my advice : spend your money elsewhere .
veggies are frozen and the salads are out of a bag .
i could get fish out of the cap canal that taste better .
my husband made reservations for us online for dinner , for my birthday .
during our entire dining experience they made no mention of my birthday to us .
( why even ask the question when we made the reservation ) !
not romantic at all .
shredded the crab way too much .
the customer next to us had the lobster and was also big time disappointed .
my partner ordered a steak and it was a bit cold .
so so disappointed .
i 've been meaning to visit this restaurant for a long time .
needless to say that i 've built up my expectations over time .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
the new england clam chowder was so watery .
it was a bowl of soup , definitely not chowder .
the best dish for the night was the jumbo shrimp pasta .
not much presentation but it was tasty .
i will not come back again .
it was n't worth it .
this review is not related to the food , weird i know .
this time i knew better !
dress ruined !
very disappointed and will never return .
ugh , this place is lame .
we 've eaten here every year for the past ten years .
this year was such a disappointment .
had to wait _num_ minutes for our table .
once seated , the service was very slow .
the end of the meal , no mention of it being our anniversary .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
i had half a dozen oysters and the new england clam chowder .
went this evening and had a more than terrible experience .
asked for blue cheese stuffed olives .
one came with mushrooms ( soggy ) the other none .
manager tells me they do n't cook their fish all the way .
at this point i 'm done .
are you sure you do n't want desert ?
he never uses salt and pepper out but did tonight .
one of the worst meals ever .
think _num_ or _num_ or even _num_ times before going there .
bad food .
bad service .
but make sure to check your bill !
i had the beef wellington , and so did my daughter .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
probably would not eat here again .
nothing flavorful and under salted food over salted crab water .
escargot was only item worth recommending .
atmosphere was quiet and there is nothing modern about it .
no one called me back , no one said anything .
are you kidding me ?
i ca n't be away from them for _num_ and a half hours !
not only that , they used previous patients as the excuse .
rick ( a really cool and attractive ) female bartender ... is sadly missed .
a very dear friend of mine worked here for ... almost a year ?
it 's usually impossible to find parking .
i 'm sure if i was still in college , i 'd like it .
i wo n't be going back here , its just depressing .
_num_ stars .
whether they were understaffed or what , i do n't know .
the bartender chick snapped at me and screamed `` no more pitchers ! ''
that bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
cheap ass drinks could n't make up for it .
i might be back , but i 'm in no hurry .
trash .
trash .
trash .
this bar is a complete waste of time .
i do not like the size of the dance floor .
the parking sucks , too .
the drinks are cheap , though .
its dark , the drinks are cheap , and theres room for great bands .
i can not stand dudes in girl 's jeans .
more wasted money .
it was the worst starbucks i 've ever been .
there no is proper place to sit .
are n't they all pretty much the same layout with relatively similar menus .
there were only two employees .
i do n't really get the crowd here .
drinks are cheap and the staff seems pretty friendly .
you guys got ta get it together so people do n't leave in frustration .
i walked around yesterday at at and was extremely disappointed .
i walked in anyway , despite thinking i was in the wrong place .
the selection was poor in my opinion .
i 'd prefer to just keep buying mine at nordstrom .
they have some sexy costume stuff , but that looked cheap too .
the store made me feel dirty and cheap .
glad i walked out empty handed .
upon entering i realized something was very different - there was hardly any suits .
zero !
lame .
the prices are okay but not the best in the area .
the alcohol section is large which is useful for a party .
i do n't recommend the wing bar , not worth it .
never have enough registers open so i started going to frys instead .
but , this past week i have gone into ace hardware _num_ times .
i did n't even bother to ask for help this time .
she did n't hesitate to completely ignore me and pick up the phone .
i will not go back to ace hardware again .
staff at checkout is unhelpful .
since i still had questions , don promised to return the call .
two hours passed without a phone call so i contacted the store again .
unfortunately , don had gone to lunch .
i left my call back number , again .
upon returning from lunch , don called , but he was rude .
immediately , i knew that don did n't want to extend our conversation .
they advertise as a _num_ star hotel , but the quality is definitely sub-par .
avoid this place at all costs !
why did n't they knock on some doors or investigate the matter further ?
they would n't even comp our room !
there is a cozy little bar and a restaurant .
room _num_ a/c does n't work too well .
also , do n't get a room next to the stairs .
the sound of children playing does n't bother me so much though .
when i tried to call back , she refused to answer the phone .
the restaurant is only open for breakfasts .
this place was terrible !
the room smelled like old popcorn when we arrived late in the afternoon .
the place needs to be remodeled badly and i would not stay here again .
i will not be coming back anytime soon .
they initially told me it would take about _num_ minutes to get it done .
so my _num_ minute oil change turned into _num_ hours and a scam .
went to midas to get an oil change .
they would n't ruin their reputation would they ?
they told me they could do it , no problem , within an hour .
price was _num_ .
another $ _num_ bucks .
i 'm glad to see there are other negative reviews on here as well .
very unhappy with this place .
i switched to advanced auto on mcdowell and it is much better .
absolute worst auto care place i 've ever been to in my life !
this was a $ _num_ job .
this was another $ _num_ to replace .
had no choice really so had this done .
it would then take a second to get up & go again .
i had to make an appointment and i was there about _num_ minutes early .
very disappointed .
they will rip you off .
the following day i took my jeep into midas for a quick oil change .
i was hung up on before i could finish my rant .
called back , no answer .
avoid this place at all cost .
i completely believe i was overcharged and i will not be returning .
i inform mike of a noise i 'm hearing coming from the drivers side .
almost $ _num_ out of pocket .
a few days later , i 'm hearing the same noise .
so i take it in this am for a _num_ appointment .
about _num_ minutes later , i ask if they 've found anything .
james says , we 'll let you know what we find .
after about another _num_ minutes , he comes over by the waiting area .
i gave them one star because that is the worst i could give them .
they deserve no stars .
there was no signs of a radiator leak until i took my car in .
they also handed me a laundry list of things to fix .
i was told _num_ min to and hour .
they then tried to sell me other things such as alignment .
it was ridiculous i waited that long .
i 'm glad i only bought _num_ groupon cause i wo n't go back .
among this list is an alignment sheet saying my car is out of alignment .
i tell them my situation and instantly they asked if i came from midas .
apparently they have been getting this a lot from midas customers .
do not fall for this scam !
my experience was bad .
cheap store , quality of work _num_ .
cheap frames , cheap lenses , rude staff !
they claim excuse after excuse , not to fix there cheap quality lenses !
they tire i had to buy because mt tire got ruined was way overpriced .
would not recommend this place .
i left bummed out .
well , $ _num_ later i have ac !
how did advanced auto come to the conclusion that my compressor was bad ?
they saved me $ _num_ .
really bad business !
the greens and the grass around the greens were in fine shape .
if you just show up it 's $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
believe it or not , that 's too much dough for this place .
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
come for the driving range , do n't come for anything else .
the place smelled of dogs ( as to be expected ) .
in the meantime , i read tracy 's yelp review about their experience .
she was not pleased with this request .
she stated that no one had ever requested this before .
only had grooming done at this hole in the wall dirty place .
that should have been a clue for me not to take him .
i 'm convinced that this is the smallest peter piper in existence .
it was so rude .
it 's bigger than a chuck e cheese and the staff is way friendlier .
avoid this location at all costs .
each game is two coins which is too much if you ask me .
the bathrooms are old and gross .
lost a long time customer !
also mentioning he gets a $ _num_ tip for letting people sit there .
( which is why they get two stars ) .
came on a sunday , which was pretty dead .
the charge is _num_ dollars to enter and you get two ten dollar drinks .
with much hesitation i paid for my gf and myself 's entry fee .
worst mistake i have made in a long time .
i told him i just wanted my money back .
he refused and said the owner does not give any refunds what so ever .
called over a skinny tall skin head to help kick us out .
do not waste your time !
wish yelp had zero stars .
this place was the worst establishment i have every seen .
lost their lease .
i went in , the place was dead .
go back _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes later and my car is still sitting where i parked it .
i get frustrated and leave .
it still takes them _num_ minutes to do a basic oil change .
do n't bother .
i have waited _num_ hours and still have not had my car looked at .
unfortunately , the adjustments he performed on me made my condition worse .
much worse .
recently ordered a meal from my location for a christmas party .
the tip was _num_ dollars .
if i could rate this location less than one star , i would .
they never returned my calls .
again , no reply .
no apology .
no communication from hertz at all throughout this entire process .
lack of professionalism throughout the entire ordeal .
worst customer service .
do not rent a car from here , worst experience ever .
_num_ week later they charged me $ _num_ for gas .
but i was grateful and left it at that .
one month later ... still no credit .
one week later ... still no call .
i 've given up at this point but talk about overall bad experience .
and it was the manager ( shawn ) that we were dealing with .
she could n't have cared less .
poor customer service and car experience .
big mistake .
i just signed up to yelp after reading all these nice reviews .
i really needed to let everybody know about my horrible experience there recently .
i tell her that i 'm going to buy around _num_ dollars of food .
anyway , i order .
there are two long disgusting hairs in my burger .
she says i 've been rude since she told me about the coffee .
she is a waitress not a lawyer !
she 's wrong !
no other establishment has given me an issue when i bring my coffee in .
do n't believe me ?
when something feels wrong , remember this post .
just not this one .
try to get that burger for under _num_ or _num_ bucks .
they keep getting negative reviews filtered .
you are not getting accurate reviews here .
why would i come back and check here ?
i hate coming to this sally 's .
eh , fairly small store .
um ... oh and the body jewelry is very expensive .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
also , breakfast is free , drinks from 5:00 to 6:30 .
but by turning the air conditioning down to _num_ .
and they only gave us two towels .
worst .
no problem , i 'll just turn up the heater .
phone line ... completely dead , so back over to the office .
dead phone .
failure to honor the breakfast package .
do n't do it ... you 'll be sorry !
what room do i get , of course the highway side .
the televisions are over _num_ years old , tube televisions with horrible viewing .
the cable cuts out every _num_ minutes and goes to a blue screen .
really run down .
shower barely had hot water .
for the most part , it was n't too bad .
i called the front desk but they we not helpful .
the cold nights with no heater were no fun .
it was a nice little additional bang for your buck .
too bad .
run , do n't walk vw !
people are incredibly condescending .
i even got called `` buddy '' which is plain insulting in that situation .
i had to wait _num_ hours for a tow truck out in mesa .
avoid financing with them at all costs .
a deal is not a deal at chapman !
dishonest !
i am not sure if they treat everyone this way or just women .
wow , i wish i 'd checked yelp before i went to chapman .
we wo n't be going back .
worst experience in _num_ yr history of auto shopping !
but when they came back with the offer it was an absolute insult !
this is why i think car dealerships are disgusting .
i have never felt so offended in my life .
couple days later , it was just as bad .
not true .
i will not bring my dog back and advise everyone else not to .
terrible customer service .
he is only _num_ yrs old so this should not have happened !
would never go back and never recommend .
my poor dog was in so much pain .
horrible place .
never had any issues ever with all my other dogs at the vet .
it 's not worth saving a few hundred dollars .
i feel bad for going the cheap route .
i told him the price was $ _num_ on the can .
i though this might be wrong and just checked myself .
and ive been here a dozen times , just knot icing this now .
bad form .
do n't get me wrong .
when i walked into vision quest , i was greeted by .
unfortunately , that time has come and gone .
what a disappointment !
what a disappointing experience .
the employees are very rude and do not look at you .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
vision quest , just for the record , you suck .
this place has awful customer service and a bad attitude .
no thanks .
i wo n't be back .
i walked that store twice looking to see if i missed something .
there could n't have been more than _num_ ?
capital t for terrible .
it 's really a shame .
those days are long gone .
now , it 's not .
no business .
i made arrangements with my job so i could be sure to attend .
not very professional , vision quest .
what about the time i wasted ?
come to think of it , so is my business .
this time , at least at the time i visited , no .
sure , the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it .
good , but not good enough .
had i listened to other yelpers i would n't have wasted my time .
they looked old and many had worn covers .
at least they gave me a laugh .
no further explanation .
not worth the money .
not personalized or warm at all .
customer lost !
unbelievably horrible customer service .
an absolute waste of time .
they deserve no one 's business .
new resident to az , called in with a few questions .
pathetic customer service .
do not support businesses that do not understand customer service .
i suggest going elsewhere if you feel like being treated as a paying patron !
lady runs a 3rd party dmv with her dog which is extremely aggressive !
believe the negative reviews because the positive ones are probably by friends or family .
went here to have a mobile home title transferred .
i sit down and peruse yelp reviews .
me , i guess i should asked the right question before sitting and waiting .
i asked can you tell me where i can get this done .
terrible service and rude .
shannon is so rude !
so i have used this place twice to title a vehicle .
i will not be giving this place anymore business .
she then charged me another $ _num_ .
that is part of doing this job correctly .
this lady is absolutely rude and does not act like a small business owner .
molly maids is pretty hit or miss for a cleaning service .
seems a little long to me for such a small place .
whatever you do do n't sign up for information !
i would n't hire them even if they paid me to do it .
they pushed away a customer .
for some reason , it took them almost three hours .
very overpriced , inefficient and nothing special !
hands down , the worst cleaning ever !
in short , exactly what i needed .
run , do n't walk , away from this company !
huge mistake .
_num_ hrs , and $ _num_ later , not much to show for it .
however , they took _num_ hours to clean _num_ sq .
then at _num_ i left to drop my car off .
and stuff was n't done .
i was very pleased .
it was getting so late on a saturday night that i almost fell asleep .
terrible service and an ice cold pizza !
no sorry for the long wait .
does anyone have the number for pizza hut ?
he did n't have my mt .
he apologized over and over about something he had no control over .
whoever answered the phone was completely rude .
wtf is wrong with this company !
what the hell did i just eat .
advertise and deliver correctly .
order garlic parm breadsticks and get dry breadsticks .
order chicken and get no chicken .
so unless you want to be refused service , try another location .
i spoke with the manger as well because i was truly offended .
they did n't even say sorry .
hahaha this place is a joke !
not a good one either .
there are no bikes !
there was no one there to show us around .
like no one !
no awkward old guy .
totally not what i was looking for but at least from same family .
so i quickly signed the papers and took delivery of the bike .
after i got back i noticed that they overcharged me $ _num_ .
calls back .
about these issues after checking with derek - no call !
first , i walk in and say `` i have an appointment . ''
_num_ minutes pass so i walk back to the car place .
so fifteen minutes after i came back the car is done .
i ca n't believe any of this .
never coming back or recommending first class auto to anyone that i know .
highly suggest pep boys across the street though !
this is not a lie , just use it as a warning .
he will cheat you like he did me .
what you can do is refund my $ _num_ .
no i know you ca n't and wo n't .
walked in first thing in the morning for my saturday appointment .
i was talked down to in a way and really not taken very seriously .
was a very cold and unwelcoming experience for a first time customer .
it was way too hostile , too quickly .
the cost for _num_ minutes of work + diagnostic was $ _num_ .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
morning to have it looked at .
my initial thoughts were `` great , so i just spent my sat .
americanized chinese food that is overwhelmingly average .
not pleased .
but the food that i received was sub-par .
it just did n't have any flavor !
the lo mien noodles were ... awkward .
other than that the food was not great and barely good .
wontons were mush , and tasted terrible .
the king triple delight was just so-so .
very average , not great flavor , but not bad .
what is up with that out here ?
ca n't you just charge me extra ?
anyway , i decided on the rice bowl size .
this was the better dish .
they gave us two plates of white rice that were approximately three cups each .
maybe other dishes on the menu are better i do n't know .
i 'm so hungry , why wo n't you bring me my food ?
totally ridiculous , i will never order from them again .
they seem to be really inconsistent .
overall , unless you are desperate , i 'd try somewhere else .
you may get lucky , but if not then you 'll regret it .
god , that was a mistake .
and i swear to god , they were spaghetti noodles .
never going back .
i probably would not recommend going here again .
the food i was served was nasty .
i will not go back there .
however , today i ordered from here and the food deserved zero stars .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
if you are a chinese food junkie like me , try another spot .
this is the kind of place which gives chinese food a bad name .
it was actually hard to tell where the chicken was hiding .
the lunch specials are n't so bad ... .
but the food is your typical fast food chinese place .
greasy , saucy , mediocre .
try the sesame chicken .
the pepper steak is really overly sauced up but not too bad .
the fried wontons are yummy but the egg rolls are super bland .
i 've had this feeling one too many times .
it 's seriously too big to even swim in a tank that small .
it literally ca n't move .
terrible .
the food was just the worst .
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
the egg foo young however was the worst i have ever tasted .
it was like a bite of a dense veggie patty .
so , word of warning - that is how they prepare egg foo young .
this was just bad enough that i had to write a review .
i wish there were zero stars .
china wok is getting _num_ star simply because of extremely poor service .
they said _num_ miles is was very , very far away .
it was difficult to eat !
i got no response but some yelling in another language i do n't understand .
more yelling , no real response .
so i state my order again hoping this time they 'll get it right .
am i met with an apologetic response ?
strike _num_ !
poor form china wok .
just such a disappointing experience all around .
we all ended up throwing everything away .
the bad : well ... .
they were too hard to even break apart .
i would n't recommend this place .
terrible customer service .
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
the egg fu young was horrible .
the edges were so tough i could n't get my plastic fork through it .
gross , gross and gross .
service was awkward and food was horrible .
so nasty , if i can give no stars i would .
things quickly went horribly wrong once i placed my order .
is this remotely close to how one should appropriately handle a food safety issue ?
i went to jiffy lube instead .
nothing snapped off .
i have never waxed my car . ''
it 's uneven all over .
ok , i 'm done .
i can not get a consistent haircut from these folks .
these past _num_ times , i tell the lady my simple hair cut .
and they do n't even get that right .
but this last chance was the last straw .
but _num_ in a row ... .
the fool is me .
really slow and not great haircut this evening .
i would not recommend this place .
seriously , girls , _num_ stars ?
neither were satisfactory .
the actual mani/pedi was sub-par , at best .
she did an okay job with the cuticles , but nothing special .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life !
he looked rather angry that i did not leave him a tip .
okay , so i did n't thoroughly research this nail place prior to going .
i was also a rushed `` walk-in '' client .
yes , i tipped but not overly .
butt hurt bc you did n't get tipped to your standard ?
i came for a full set .
that is what started to piss me off .
no problem right ?
he started rushing through my nails and acted rude .
i ca n't complain about the quality so much .
how embarrassing for that establishment to beg for tips .
i waited for my nails to dry and i walked out .
but do n't worry it does n't end there .
here now getting a pedicure ... and it 's awful .
he just rubbed the lotion on .
and he did n't get all the crap off the bottom of my feet .
only thing that was `` okay '' was the paint job .
sitting here now , and getting a pedicure with my sister and my mom .
they started doing my pedicure and stopped to take someone else .
she would push my moms hands out of the way and just plain rude !
she was beyond rude , my lady was even rolling her eyes .
hello , it 's all women who were not even paying attention to her .
i will not be back and do not recommend them for anyone .
made a reservation for _num_ during restaurant week , confirmed the day before .
am i stuck in some weird dream ?
was i really just served cold duck confit ?
am i really eating it ?
did i really just wait _num_ minutes for someone to take my credit card ?
service was slow , and the server had a slight attitude the entire night .
she was brought a plate of _num_ bite size slices .
the waiter said no , that 's not true .
it 's wrong . ''
-- no host stand was a bit awkward for me and guests .
just uncomfortable .
did we go through the wrong door ?
for the entire dining room ( _num_ tables ? )
it 's all about the food ?
do n't serve it , you lazy assholes !
-- rib eye not trimmed , huge chunks of fat .
we were sorely disappointed .
waited _num_ minutes with no apologies or explanation .
so obnoxious .
walked out and will never return .
you know , i wish i could write a review of the food .
i 've tried to dine at this place on _num_ separate occasions .
the first time was admittedly my fault .
ugh .
the second time we tried to go , it was closed .
still , we gave them another chance .
called after they opened at 5:30 but got no answer .
called _num_ or _num_ times and even left a message but nothing .
we were so incredibly disappointed .
it was my favorite restaurant in all of phoenix .
the focus was on presentation , not on providing a real meal .
but alas , even here the restaurant i loved the most was sorely disappointing .
and this was for a very special occasion .
what a disappointment .
the problem was the food .
everything we ate we could n't really taste because of all the salt .
luckily the free yelp corkage coupon is accepted !
called to try to make a reservation , no answer .
this it 's pretty ridiculous .
it appears the only way to eat here is one of these special events .
do n't think we 'll waste our time again .
this place was disgusting and should be shut down for so many reasons .
i 've been here twice to try to get takeout .
i gave them two chances and two fails .
it was actually pretty bad .
so , i read reviews and thought i would try out their delivery .
truth be told , i did n't even get to the order .
he told brian that the delivery guy would be there in _num_ minutes .
i gave it a one because i could n't give it anything less .
it 's a step above pf changs with a lower price .
prob the most screwed up restaurant in scottsdale .
nobody can talk as loud and as much as this guy .
the consistency was slimy and weird .
i would not recommend this place .
when i gave up , after several minutes , i walked out .
they lost my $ _num_ order and i hope yours too .
but i really hate when i leave a place feeling used & played .
the restaurant is too small to be loud .
the problem is the bartender .
generally never had a problem until today .
why do n't you know the menu ?
i wo n't be coming here again .
i felt bad for the other servers , they seemed embarrassed .
worst chinese food ever .
wrong .
do not waste your money and time .
service was bad !
around _num_ degrees .
i kind of think this place is highly overrated .
not so good .
the service is always horrible and the sandwiches always take forever .
its little mistakes that make this place a hassle to visit .
if you are in a hurry for lunch i do not reccomend this place .
the choices are limited and it is outrageously expensive .
wo n't go back there anytime soon .
the sandwiches were mediocre at it 's best .
the sandwiches tasted bland and cold cuts were dry .
even though the sandwiches were delicious , we are hesitant to return .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
i arrived _num_ minutes later .
my meatball hero was ready but the calzone was not .
hmm .
i 'm not so sure about this one .
i consider myself to be a sandwich snob .
the bread was n't really that great .
the meat was n't anything special .
i was expecting my socks to be knocked off .
everything seemed stale and old .
however , tonight , i ordered a soup , they were out of .
the cashier refused to make more of the soup of the day .
after waiting 10-15 minutes to hear the news , he offered a dinner salad .
i went up to the counter and spoke to the owner .
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
it 's not that hard to please the customer .
not a big deal , do n't attack the customer .
that 's unacceptable .
wo n't be back .
`` i 've been going here for _num_ years and it was incredible .
my sandwich taste like its been sitting in circle k for weeks .
get better , you 've lost a loyal customer .
this was my second time this week to experience defalco 's .
really dude ?
the rest of it is just cucumber and onions .
lame .
my dad and i split a whole combo sandwich .
that was not the case tonight .
sorry to say that i do n't think i will visiting this establishment again .
very disappointed for my first and last time coming here .
thankfully , i did not think the cheesesteak was that good at all !
there is no excuse for ignorant management .
service is really slow .
they acknowledged me , but could n't send anyone to help me .
i was seriously disappointed at the size of these sandwiches for the price .
i ca n't imagine spending $ _num_ for one of these half sandwiches .
the flavor of the meat was n't too bad though .
the mushrooms were nice and the cheese sauce was really good too .
the meatball sub was n't anything special to me either .
not sure i 'd ever really come back .
the food was okay , but the service was terrible .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
but overall the food was not memorable or worth the drive .
the italian sausage sandwich was ok .
no apologies no cares .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
was nasty .
the espresso was atrocious .
it 's beyond words how bad it is .
really awful .
this was explained as a computer error .
maybe i missed something here , but i was n't impressed .
it was greasy , very salty and the order was wrong .
will not go back .
i have no idea why people rave about this place .
ordered chicken parm and mac and cheese .
mac and cheese , same deal .
literally watered down and tasted like nothing .
i tried to taste it , it literally tasted like nothing .
it was good , extremely reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread .
not being rude here it just was reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread .
horrible sums this place up !
stale bread with stale toppings .
i will not give them a second try .
the man took _num_ minutes to help me .
he chose to ignore me .
after that i did n't even want to order , i simply walked out .
the other is the italian cold cut which i will try .
price is n't bad and decent value .
this place has gone downhill very fast .
what a disappointment .
ever !
no thank you .
for horrible service .
i went to counter and placed my order .
i was completely disappointed .
philly cheese steaks mediocre .
the place was disgusting , too many employees standing around doing nothing as well .
it was actually uncomfortable to be stared at while we ate .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
worst italian beef sandwich ever .
no taste no flavor to the meat .
this place is very cramped .
prices are too high for what you get in this no-frills place .
i ordered a margarita calzone and the toppings cost $ _num_ .
after waiting in line _num_ minutes i ordered the italian combo to go .
waited another _num_ min for them to prepare and off i went .
to start , what they call `` toasted '' is just warmed up .
no way i can recommend this place for sub sandwiches or deserts .
the same time i bought the sausages i also purchased meatballs .
it probably should have been closed .
the food was nothing special and actually below average .
no napkins or silverware was provided .
nobody bother to check on customers .
maybe a bad day , but still unacceptable .
just not worth the money or time for that kind of experience .
i could n't find an italian in the place .
the food is _num_ % canned garbage .
they serve there meatball sub on a hotdog bun .
make sure you have your toilet paper very , very close ... .
not only offensive but over the top rude .
i walk around checking out the stuff even walk by them and nothing !
do n't bee fooled the do have a large array of water as well .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
when you walk in you cant leave with out getting a drink or two .
the website says nothing about the store being closed .
they recently decided that they do not rotate tires if they are remotely worn .
shame on you discount !
total con artists .
rude !
rude !
rude !
i could not believe the poor service and how long it took .
maybe it was because they were n't selling me new tires .
i wo n't be going back .
last may i had become suddenly ill and lost my balance .
mayo phoenix will not .
i 'm rolling my eyes at you .
not once did he ask me how i felt , symptoms , etc .
the entire appointment took _num_ minutes .
er staff was just awful !
after being admitted the nurses were n't any better .
i had skin cancer - diagnosed and operated on by physicians at mayo .
mayo turned out to be a nightmare for me .
i made the appointment and gave them my insurance information .
i was just trying to find a primary care physician in my area .
i go to leave and there is no co pay due at the time .
worst customer service practice i 've ever encountered .
i was charged $ _num_ for those _num_ minutes .
when i asked what was the follow-up , she said there was none .
no treatment , no suggestions , nothing .
this gave me no life .
went immediately to another hospital where i was admitted .
oh my goodness ... it is a total nightmare !
this is not of their doing and we know that .
how does this place maintain such a stellar reputation ?
especially given the reviews here , i am probably lucky to be turned away .
my husband and i went in for a _num_ buzz and a bang trim .
they 're crooked and there are multiple stands that are too long .
it 's a shame .
i wish i could leave negative stars .
the employees here clearly hate their jobs .
that was the case for me tonight .
i stood at the empty counter and waited .
she makes eye contact with me then quickly looks away .
i wait a few minutes longer .
i just decided to leave .
this is not the first bad experience i 've had here .
it 's just horribly ran .
no explanation -- nothing .
two months later i received a missed appt bill of _num_ .
also would n't take a coupon because it was n't presented on arrival .
never had either of these problems at any other jiffy lube .
terrible experience with the staff .
they were not willing to show an apartment .
no thanks .
i do not smoke .
if one of my guests smoke outside , that is none of their business !
although the perfect apt doesnt exist , i would recommend looking elsewhere .
they decide to expand their store and in the process kill a small business .
but i 'm quite literally here _num_ times a week .
no more .
it 's horrible .
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .
terrible customer service .
a full set takes at least _num_ - _num_ minutes .
no apology .
no respect for my time !
i would give zero stars if i could .
this place is the worst .
unbelievable .
i was told they will see me in court to see who wins .
on principle alone this company really disappointed me .
avoid this place !
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
the change in management is a disaster .
keep the desperate summer coupons coming in the mail .
after you fire the managers you might see some profit .
this has got to be the worst car wash in the area .
been going to this car wash for a few years now .
it gets slower and slower every time .
not going back .
this place is the worst .
made my wife so mad that she left and went to another place .
they are rude and do n't care if you leave .
went in a few weeks later the attendant tries to charge me $ _num_ .
i am shocked that she did not get in the car and leave .
you have to pay money to just sit in the chair , thats ridiculous !
the guys who greet you are horribly obnoxious and pushy .
no , no , no .
ugh .
the car did not look any different than a regular car wash .
this business is the epitome of bad business practices .
my wife drove off without letting these thieves touch her car .
if i could leave _num_ stars , i would .
if you 're looking for something like clean freak , this is n't it .
had a _num_ % coupon , so i got the fancy wash plan .
the outside looks great , but the interior was awful .
never wiped the seats down either !
i had a coupon and was being pushed towards the higher priced wash .
i had a coupon and was being pushed towards the higher priced wash .
very disappointing experience .
i will not be going back .
three hours later the job was done .
in particular the bathroom was disgusting .
there is just no way i will return .
they tried other upscale items too .
look at other reviews and i agree with how bad this place is .
high pressure sales and poor cleaning .
not coming here anymore .
i feel like i wasted $ _num_ on nothing .
high hygienist turnover with inconsistent questionable billing ... nice facilities .
i used this dental shop for over a year .
there is something wrong going on here .
nothing but ultra thin cardboard ... ... .
domino 's , have no fear ... ... i 'll never be back .
if it had been possible to give zero stars , i would have .
raw uncooked dough in the middle .
bland , boring and pathetic toppings .
and now i will tell you what added insult to injury .
i wo n't be ordering again .
therefore , i make my own .
_num_ folks were sitting at the small bar .
already not good .
the food was not good and not worth the price .
then i opted for the penne with chicken and mushrooms in a pink sauce .
how can you mess this one ... well it happened .
terrible !
too expensive for bad food .
order a seafood pasta and the seafood was old and smelly .
avoid it like the plague .
honey 's pasta was really disappointing .
it just did nothing for either of us .
it seems my experience with good veal is extremely limited .
should i learn my lesson ( s ) and just stop ordering it ?
plus , i would rather not have mashed potatoes with my italian meal .
chicken over cooked , tough .
nerve to serve chicken with boxed potatos and canned beans .
very disappointed .
i do n't think so and i will never go back here again .
we had pasta and it ended up costing us _num_ dollars , ridiculous .
i think think the restaurant is in obvious financial trouble .
this is my first _num_ star rating !
unfortunately , i came for food and not the ambiance .
it was n't cold at all and definitely was n't worth the money .
it deserves negative five .
first off i went there to grab lunch and i ordered my food .
the health inspector needs a surprise visit .
i called the manager twice and left messages but no response .
no wonder the place is a shut whole .
where i 'm from spoiled me i guess .
i 'm used to seeing strawberry in it and more cheesecake .
i ended up throwing it away .
they also served people who ordered after me first .
i 'm never going back .
first off the lady that was working today was super rude and mean .
the older lady who ended up helping was horrible .
the sizes were not clearly marked and the woman did n't care .
there are a few reasons why i never go to mcdonalds .
_num_ -- bad food .
_num_ -- which i just experienced , is an incompetent work force .
unfortunately i live right by this one .
well , not so much .
she hands me my drink , then she hands me the receipt .
i 'm not pissed about being charged $ _num_ .
i 'm pissed that my time was wasted .
i stop at mcdonalds perhaps three times a year .
i do n't like mcdonalds food .
i 'm no loving it !
so i am taking my business elsewhere .
unfortunately this ups location is less than friendly or helpful .
try the location near fry 's in fountain hills .
do not rent a po box from this lady !
i have had numerous rude run ins with her .
zero customer service .
she was yelling at me across the store in front of other customers .
i drove all the way over there from chandler and it was n't out .
a simple `` i 'm sorry , what box are you ?
never a i 'm sorry or even really offering to help .
so yes the old owner was horrible .
with my standard box , i now can receive _num_ packages or be charged .
worst ever !
there are much better places for breakfast .
i have to agree with shannon w this time .
the hollandaise sauce is disgusting , and the ham needs to be sliced much .
much thinner , the eggs benedict should be avoided .
no excuse .
terrible service with very unfriendly waitresses and staff .
i 've been to better breakfast joints !
the food is nothing to write home about .
i really have never experienced a server like that in my life .
that 's all i have to say about this one .
this location has serious wait staff issues .
we ate there in january and the staff is rude and slow !
the hostess was not nice whatsoever .
i never reviewed it because i felt a loyalty to the other store .
i was annoyed , but ate it anyway .
the other day i ordered _num_ strawberry pancakes .
but they did n't cut the price .
i ordered corned beef hash and eggs .
hash was cold , eggs cold .
this is just typical of what is going on there .
on a side note , this place used to be crowded .
now the place is always empty .
_num_ or _num_ tables occupied .
maybe i am not the only one who feels this way ?
there was not wait whatsoever and the place was packed on a saturday morning .
this place is horrible !
the past several visits , though , have made me stay away for good .
they seem to be everywhere , even indoors .
that 's not good enough .
it 's become bad , really bad .
it was just a little strange .
horrible service !
not the first time service has been less than average !
heck , they do n't even carry green peppers any more !
calorie counts are no longer listed , even though the website claims they are .
worst service ever !
once we got our food my mothers was cold and was n't right .
huge disappointment !
the coffee was horrible .
pancakes the worst i 've ever had .
the eggs are not cooked properly and lack salt .
with below average coffee i wo n't be going back .
the main problem was inconsistent and nonexistent service .
our server , piper p , seemed like she 'd rather be anywhere else .
piper was nowhere to be seen most of the time .
the coffee here was terrible as well , no taste , just bitter .
overall , a horrible experience on june _num_ , at _num_ pm .
i was very unhappy not sure i 'll go there again .
three of the four plates were served cold .
the fourth was forgotten entirely .
did n't make any sense .
it took _num_ minutes to get our food .
my kale salad had no kale , just mixed greens that were pretty wilted .
boyfriend 's oatmeal was cold .
waited awhile but she never came back .
regardless , there are plenty of better places to go for breakfast .
our server must have been having a bad day or something .
the food took _num_ minutes to come out and was completely cold .
the potatoes were undercooked , and there was a hair on the bacon .
this place could be my go to for sunday breakfast .
how can you mess up eggs ?
serve cooked eggs cold .
unless i 'm in the mood for cold cooked eggs .
i like their web site , and claims of quality , and pricing .
i also could not smell any hint of dry cleaning fluid odor .
so i do n't know if it was cleaned or not ?
however , something happened recently that may change my mind .
this place is very reasonably priced and in a convenient location next to albertsons .
no one at the front register , drive-thru or cook stations .
this place is always dead .
perhaps if there were people that actually worked , they 'd have more patrons .
the worst coffee in the city of tempe .
this happened to my coworker this week .
do n't count on using their wi-fi though ... it sucks .
the service is unfriendly and super slow .
however , their drinks are awful .
my bad for ordering something they did not stock .
i ended up with a gigantic , tasteless mess .
this has happened numerous times .
stock your cafe properly and i will give _num_ or _num_ stars .
not because they were special or anything but because it was really cheap .
that sandwich really is a joke .
he does not respect anyone 's time other than his own .
no need to add further stress to the procedure .
there are plenty of professional , customer friendly dentists to choose from .
i was very disappointed .
everything was generic and bland , at best .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
there were no other customers in the restaurant .
wo n't be going back .
are there any authentic chinese restaurants in scottsdale ?
does anyone know what authentic chinese is ?
i 've seen them only in seattle and nyc .
avoid ordering any of the soups ... ... their pretty poor .
it was horrible .
i 'm still sick from those few bites !
it was like an asian spring roll with chunks of italian sausage inside !
grateful even when i am paying .
no wonder the place was ( not ) hopping on a saturday night !
simply one of the worst meals ever .
waited more -- complained -- was offered a glass of wine .
waited another twenty minutes for dinner -- same thing .
cold and mediocre .
unfortunately , the expectation did n't meet up with reality .
he gave no explanation so i tipped as usual .
very disappointed !
do yourself a favor go elsewhere !
just not impressed .
low quality ingredients in my opinion .
rubbery chicken and beef , high prices for the quality .
have been here twice , and there will be no third visit .
sorry george , but you need to improve your food quality .
what an awful , awful experience with take out from here .
i have no idea of why i was stupid enough to just walk out .
every time i order from them i swear i 'm never going back .
the quality is not there when it comes to the price .
every time i order food , something is always overcooked .
the food here is `` hit or miss . ''
after waiting for _num_ minutes , he gave up and left .
pity , because the food was good .
if you have an allergy to msg like i do .
it 's really obvious that msg is and everything .
i 'm always amazed at americans love of really bad chinese food .
it was over fried and very hard .
_num_ ) shrimp fried rice .
something that even a chinese takeout place should not be able to mess up .
it tasted like dirt .
and the shrimp obviously was not fresh ... and very salty .
vegetables used are frozen ... their not fresh .
i 've eaten here before and ate the buffet .
i 've eaten better chinese food at airport chinese faster restaurants .
it 's really expensive ... for what you get .
no fresh vegetables ... everything frozen ... and loaded with msg .
we basically wasted about $ _num_ on food that day .
all of it had zero point zero taste .
plus every protein was over cooked !
since we 're never going back there 's no point .
i really do n't know how this place has an average rating of _num_ .
the only reason they get a _num_ is because the food was packaged nicely .
the buffet is not worth it .
the gravy was entirely too sweet and had absolutely no heat like we requested .
it was also too oily .
very stingy when i asked for my money back .
wo n't be back .
i then realized that my whole mouth smelled of onion .
but this was onion , onion , onion .
if i could have given you _num_ stars or a negative review i would .
this should have been a huge red flag when i first walked in ... .
_num_ minutes later she came back and said they are still working on it .
_num_ minutes later we were eating tacos i made at home .
so they are not wheelchair accessible .
just bad service and not handicap friendly !
only one word sums up this food - - awful !
what a waste of money !
what happened to the scottsdale location , does anyone know ?
went recently on a saturday , bad food and bad service .
i tried the buffet today and was very disappointed .
who knows but i rather spend money on gas than another meal here .
this is where i would eat if i hated chinese food .
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .
this is not as good as it used to be .
will not go back .
too bad , this place is so close to where i live .
it was expensive , portions were small for the price .
tasted decent , but very bland .
hours later my boyfriend and i are sick .
upset stomachs all night , it was pretty awful .
not worth it for bland food that makes you sick .
the food was ok , nothing special .
soup was bland , almost had no flavor .
old lady at cashier desk needs some training on customer service .
she said something that i could n't understand and hung up .
i ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza togo .
nice people but crappy pizza .
barely enough cheese on pizza .
not going back .
unfortunately this pizza hut was our favorite ... and i stress `` was '' !
but the last few months since that managers transfer it 's just been horrible !
my husband felt bad to complain a 2nd time so he brought it home .
so i left my name and number for them to call me back .
they had an opportunity to correct my issue and instead they lost a customer !
but avoid this store at all costs !
i am not going here again .
i do n't have this issue with other subway locations .
they simply state _num_ minute parking .
unfortunately the management company would not work with them & locked the doors .
the staff do n't appear knowledgeable .
just go to walgreens for deals .
front cashier , older lady , was awful !
several minutes later another tech came to the window .
like its my fault that their customer service sucks ?
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
customer service in pharmacy is non existent !
rude and inept !
wish i did n't have to give even one star !
this place is a rip off .
when they do , they do n't ring up the discount price .
when i called , the guy claimed someone must have switched the tag .
liar , i read the tag , that 's why i knew the price .
walgreens corporate should send secret shoppers .
this is by far the worst walgreens pharmacy that i have ever been too .
warning to all customers !
this pharmacy is terrible .
the employees at the pharmacy are rude and disrespectful .
uh ... what ?
do n't worry , it wo n't happen again .
you just lost a customer .
disappointed .
bull crap .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
one of the worst customer services experiences ever .
she did pay half the vet bill in a somewhat timely manner .
wish things would have worked out because it is a great concept .
i just picked up my very stressed out dogs who were literally drenched .
completely unbelievable .
in short , do not trust these people with your dogs .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
to be clear , we never apologized to karen .
if not , look elsewhere .
there was never a third coupon , as karen continues to lie about .
terrible .
this woman lost my dog after one day and i never found her .
and obviously you ca n't put a price on a lost baby .
i would n't leave my dog here !
the place looks very nice but they seem very rude and not very knowledgable !
however , it seems to be more profit driven than service driven .
i was not informed of any of these issues when i picked them .
i called and spoke with the owner and was disappointed in the conversation .
some compassion would have been appreciated .
unfortunately , the owner does not carry these same qualities .
i looked too `` soft '' .
i told her i felt uncomfortable but she insisted i try .
she was making the dogs yelp when she did this .
i would not recommend taking your dog here .
so ridiculous !
i brought in a bridesmaid dress _num_ weeks before i needed it .
after waiting _num_ minutes ( this was a good sign to me ) .
she said she was too busy with prom dresses .
had she told me this i would have gone some where else .
i was annoyed because i need to press one of the dresses .
the cost was $ _num_ ( i thought that was a little expensive ) .
showed up to pick up dress on friday morning and not done .
no apology and not even an excuse .
will not return to this business .
not reliable .
after today however i will never go back !
needless to say i did not have my dress for my trip .
however , customer service was awful .
so i did n't appreciate the attitude .
why do n't they have a tip line on the credit slip ?
wo n't be back .
i heard good things about this place so i stopped in for a pedicure .
i felt the pedicure was rushed and i could n't really enjoy it .
i wo n't be going back .
well let me tell you ladies , do not let her do your nails !
you 'll have to go get them redone like i did .
sooo unbelievably rude .
i 've certainly had worse but i was n't thrilled with my gel mani/pedi .
my mani lady was super nice but the pedi lady was definitely not friendly .
$ _num_ with tip for both .
second problem , thin walls !
so horrible !
third problem , horrible parking !
i was sad when it did n't live up to the hype .
i doubt i will go back .
unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
why ca n't the foundation sell their work for them in the museum shop ?
my friend and i booked _num_ back to back combo tours .
my dad jokes there was vodka in her water bottle .
twice our rooms were n't cleaned .
hallways elevators filthy from construction work .
i will not stay here again .
i 'm really disappointed .
the waiting time in the clinic is too long .
no one even checked in on me until my hubby had to say something .
nine patients checked in after me and were seen within _num_ min .
i was told that this was for _num_ year of personalized care .
poor customer service .
business must be good or they would not treat patients this way .
a half an hour went by , still sitting there waiting .
so i went to the front desk , asking `` how much longer ?
do n't think they even noticed to be honest .
terrible customer service !
i really hate doing this but i feel i have no choice .
i have been a patient for _num_ years and probably wo n't be anymore .
there have been other issues but i wo n't rant about it here .
the vet , older women , had a horrible bedside manner .
my baby was throwing up blood .
not impressed to say the least .
clubhouse was empty .
we pay for our rounds , and get _num_ mins to hit some balls .
we get to the tee box , no starter .
not a big deal , the guys were cool .
they 're busy , it 's my day off , no big deal .
server got _num_ of _num_ wrong .
get the food , fries were the best part .
get the check and the _num_ % is automatically added .
no wonder there was bad service .
it 's too far to be treated that way .
no drink cart or halfway stop on white wing .
and oh yeah , it takes _num_ mins to get here from north scottsdale .
i would n't play here again if you paid me $ _num_ .
the last response from rio verde : `` maybe you should consider moving . ''
absolute joke !
however , lately my visits to this store have been a huge joke .
additionally , they used to have so much more of a selection .
do n't waste time or money here , go to a different store .
but i got ta tell you that i am very disappointed in them .
went here yesterday and was extremely disappointed .
horrible .
this einstein was a terrible experience .
never knew bagel sandwiches could taste so incredibly mediocre .
not even a message on the voicemail that said they were n't open ... .
honestly the worst einstein 's i 've been to .
been there twice and my eggs were gray .
money wasted !
horrible experience !
it was almost _num_ inches longer than her shoulders !
they were so rude and i was so appalled at this kind of service .
will not be returning .
i wo n't even talk about how poorly the place is now laid out .
five people waiting to get their haircut , one dude .
not a huge fan at all .
fair prices , odd hours .
i wo n't be coming back .
door was locked .
this place is n't a that great .
they 're burgers are terrible .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
this another place that i would give no stars to if possible .
after seeing that first off , i would n't dream of ordering food here .
total meal was $ _num_ for three people and the food was awful .
my wife also had the salad bar and she said that was bad too .
i 'm just hoping i do n't get sick this evening .
you 've been warned .
loud , obnoxious music .
ra does n't serve sushi .
they serve pretentious hype .
give me an experience that does n't make my ears ring .
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
oh , then ignore my rating .
this place is overly trendy and the sushi is n't very good at all .
i absolutely could not say it better than alicia b .
it is loud music , loud people , over the top decor .
i got the `` oh , ok '' but i was skeptical .
no other fish with that ? ''
so , they were out of the toro .
no apologies , just `` we do n't have that . ''
in the end , all the better i figure .
the tempura was the only thing that was close to good .
the uni was gross .
i took one bite and left it there .
it was slimy and not fresh at all .
this is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats .
ok on top of it being a horrible experience , the fish just sucked .
really , terrible quality , terrible selection .
shame on me .
i will not be fooled again .
it 's loud , obnoxious crowd , and way too expensive !
all in all , bland and definitely overpriced .
i 've been to ra a few times and the sushi is alright .
the last time i went though the service was horrible .
also the two times i have been there the place has smelled like mildew .
i dont think i will go back .
this place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant .
the selection of sushi is disgusting .
i do not know how the came up with their menu .
the one thing i was looking forward to was the cinnamon tempura ice cream .
this dessert was the biggest let down .
it was so bitter .
that 's it , ra - you 've lost another customer .
your service completely sucks for lunch .
what a disappointment .
we spoke with the manager _num_ minutes before arriving and all was well .
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .
the service was terrible , and it was n't that busy .
not pointing in any general direction mind you .
so we sit there , and sit there .
this was my first attempt at a sushi restaraunt .
ra was really not much better , and the service was ... ok .
every single time i 've gone the service has been awful .
it takes them forever to get your drinks , orders , etc .
and whenever i have gone i have had unfriendly and uncaring servers .
i 'd recommend the ra in ahwatukee or on val vista and the _num_ .
lol , this place is hell .
oh , yeah it can .
it 's cheap , i 'll give them that .
the service is pretty bad .
i 've had a couple bad experiences .
i have no idea what was going on but it almost made me sick .
very gross .
several other times the music is just too loud .
ra is the worst place to go for sushi .
but can it really be bad ?
bottom line : there are better places , and there are worse .
i was visiting az from california yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place .
it was terrible .
the service was slow .
would not recommend .
horrible experience yesterday .
one of the worst experiences i 've had at a restaurant .
i went there with _num_ friends from work friday for lunch .
the place was only 1/3 full .
yes !
- _num_ minutes later his boxed up food is n't there yet .
- we get our check and it was incorrect .
and the _num_ free appetizers were not free on our checks .
it was absolutely ridiculous .
we were laughing at the situation the whole time .
the worst service ever .
over priced , mediocre and bland sushi .
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
and ra sushi is at the bottom of that list .
not the service .
this is exactly what ra is for sushi .
service for drinks were pretty good but for food , below average .
the waitress did admit to forgetting his order which her honesty was appreciated .
till then , spend your thirsty dollars elsewhere .
too damn expensive and the service usually sucks !
the food is good but not worth this much frustration .
i love sushi , but try to avoid the ra sushi restaurants .
the fish , was n't horrible , but definitely nothing to write home about .
i would never of my own choice go to eat here .
loud , loud , loud .
otherwise , it was $ _num_ for dinner the last time i went .
so , you know , props .
and for the high price point , this is really a turn off .
the sushi on the other hand is just meh !
it 's good but its not what i consider real sushi or quality sushi .
coming from la and san diego , this would be pathetic sushi !
i would not go here during regular hours and regular prices .
wrong !
extremely poor service .
just an overall poor experience .
pricy , and kind of unclean .
also , im not much of a sushi eater .
drinks were slow to arrive and poor lighting outside made it awkward to order .
when the food arrived , it was simply lacking .
all in all , i wo n't return .
i mean , my god .
is n't this a japanese restaurant ?
the menu is absurd .
went into ra to grab a drink with a few friends .
what the ... probably wo n't be back .
if i was reviewing the bar - _num_ stars !
i think that this place has the worst service !
my husband and i visited ra for happy hour .
unfortunately , the whole eating experience was underwhelming .
we also ordered the seared tuna and the citrus yellowtail tapas .
lastly , we sat on the patio , which is a back patio .
just bad .
horrible , thirty minutes for drinks and an hour thirty for food .
simply horrible .
horrible , inexcusable service every single time i have gone .
staff is ignorant of its customers , slow and never seem like they care .
i called in an order for pick up , it was a thursday night .
the woman taking my order told me _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes ?
rude .
i was ignored by the bartenders and other staff members .
for another _num_ minutes at least !
_num_ minutes later my order was finally given to me .
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
a couple of buddies and i were craving some sushi .
wo n't go to any restaurant that has less that _num_ stars .
my first bite was super crunchy .
i do n't know how the manager didnt take care of the whole bill .
horrible horrible horrible !
in a more than necessary rude tone .
personally we did n't try any of the food because we had eaten earlier .
we 're not supposed to know which sushi is which , the servers are .
no one made complaints on any of the sushi itself .
however based on what i saw , i know i 've had way better .
now the bad stuff .
the menu tries too hard to be cute and sexy .
most of the the wait staff could easily sub at starbucks or applebee 's .
they do n't even offer real japanese wasabi .
then i glance at it again , and keep walking .
most overpriced sushi i 've had .
no , no , and no .
the service was n't great either .
place is clean though and i do love they 're happy hour .
i guess it 's my fault for giving it so many chances .
slow !
ordered _num_ sushi dishes and a round of drinks .
sushi took _num_ minutes to come out and the drinks took _num_ minutes .
the place was n't that busy , it was steady .
i would fire management at this ra .
this response is not acceptable !
the food was bad .
completely tasteless , poorly prepared , and had a bad texture .
do n't trust a sushi place without a single japanese person working there .
sushi was tolerable , but the service was miserable .
unless you want to wait an hour for your food , do n't go .
if you just want the food , then this is the place .
we waited almost _num_ min ... not one staff member acknowledged us .
we left , no service at all .
ra should be embarrassed by this location .
came for lunch , it was dead but service was on point .
my only problem , small case if food poisoning .
i wish it was pickled just a little longer .
will never be going back to ra on mill ave .
after over an hour and a couple drinks i never even got my food .
the service was the worst .
service is hit and miss , depending on time of day .
the service is literally terrible every single time .
avoid this location .
awful service awful food .
so disappointing , other locations are significantly better .
and did but waste my precious time for lunch .
very disappointing .
i would say it smelled of urine or a dirty bathroom .
went to ra sushi today for lunch .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
for almost $ _num_ including tax and tip i 'd rather eat somewhere else .
the food is absolutely amazing but the service is terrible .
it ruins ur experience and you just think twice every time you go there .
you save a whole _num_ on some items .
others are $ _num_ off .
so disappointing !
the service was horrible ; it took forever to get anything .
i would definitely not recommend it !
i 've only have had one fast experience when it was completely empty .
nothing special .
i tried this place a couple months back .
did n't understand that episode .
went to ra with some friends monday night .
he made a lot of jokes and tried to make our experience better .
we felt pretty ignored and uncomfortable during our dinner monday night .
food is good , is n't an issue .
i gave two stars because the service was horrible .
our server was disconnected & cold .
food is pretty pedestrian , location is a plus .
barely any sashimi all salad .
compared to old town , the give next to nothing .
how disappointing .
not a big fan .
also , there seems to be some sort of bug problem .
it was so gross .
it somehow tasted stale and musty .
get off your high peaks .
it was nothing special .
my bad .
i should have walked out right then ... i knew better .
it 's loud , not air conditioned .
i like garlic , but this was bad .
what the f is that all about ?
so disappointed to have to write this !
the waiter was horrible .
terrible food .
bland , bland , bland .
but too tangy for my liking and not spicy enough even when ordered hot .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
sauce was horrible and the steak did n't have a great flavor !
r u confused yet ?
this lady was so rude i am never going back .
moral of the story is , do n't forget your id .
and if you do , do n't go to four peaks .
it 's always busy , it 's cramped , and loud .
not so .
the server was n't buying .
who i talked to did not even mention that the kitchen was under construction .
such a disappointment after a long drive and we really got our hopes up .
if i could give it a no star i would .
i do n't care what the food and beer is like .
i like the outdoor seating much better than indoor .
not unless invited by good friends .
lately , just simply awful lazy servers , cold fries _num_ of ten visits .
but i know i wont ever get all three .
i 'm not sure how this place has a _num_ star average rating .
the brewery atmosphere is standard .
the night i was there it had a lot of screaming kids running around .
the food is not a reason to go there .
we ordered their most popular items and they were nothing special .
that said the food and service was pretty respectable .
not the worst breakfast i 've ever had , but for $ _num_ ?
the mimosas were okay , but small and difficult to mess up anyway .
sorely disappointed in four peaks ' brunch .
i am not a bar person at all .
overall , not impressed !
i would never come back .
no ac , really ?
i know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me .
but the spinach salad was bad .
excuse my french .
apparently , silverware is to much to ask for .
by the time she had any interest in my experience my food was cold .
i just want a fucking steak .
this immediately pissed us all off and ruined our experience .
sometimes i get a great waitress , sometimes a terrible one .
my friend had to spit out the calamari .
i thought the quesadilla was gross ( had the taste of processed cheese ) .
and the parking situation , oh lord , do n't get me started .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
the `` beer bread '' is basically a thick flour tortilla .
it is nothing special .
needless to say , we wo n't be returning here anytime soon .
probably not the best choice for summer .
the blt was just as sorry .
i do n't remember tasting any pesto in the mayo .
tvs are on and people are chatting .
a very happening place .
maybe its me , but i do not find the plates very appetizing .
fans ( not ac ) are not on .
they have less than ten , albeit their own .
no free dessert , beer , or anything .
food and beer were good , but the service that night was awful .
sure you waited _num_ minutes for a table when you see plenty open .
or maybe i want my id back to leave .
i wrote down my address , phone number , date of birth .
still he was unsatisfied .
yes , very fishy .
the second star goes to the only thing they are able to get right .
horrible customer service .
came a few weeks ago for dinner on a particularly cold night .
there were 5-6 serves standing there ignoring us .
very disappointing .
so it 's been awhile since my last visit here .
the parking is always a nightmare and there is always a wait .
just do n't get it .
the waitress was rude and not attentive .
parking is just dumb .
no thanks .
overrated , you can stop reading now that all you need to know .
save yourself the trouble and your business elsewhere .
you gave dirty looks the entire night .
food and beer was fantastic , but it was not worth that terrible wait .
the food is mediocre and so are the drinks .
worse then the food & watered down drinks was the horrible horrible service .
needless to say i got no reply , no apology , nada .
their nachos & spinach artichoke dip are n't bad .
therefore , _num_ stars .
unfortunately , the 8th st location sucks .
would give it zero .
actually my bad , i really did n't think about it .
i asked where i could wait .
so , i asked if i could grab a table to wait .
want to know why they get a bad review ?
there were _num_ open tables and no one in line .
i do n't even know if i want my beloved kiltlifter anymore .
i 'm not a fan .
their beer is n't my favorite , and their food is sub-par .
i went to four peaks on wednesday night around _num_ pm with my boyfriend .
our server was checking in on every other table except for ours .
based on their silly little policy , i guess this would make sense .
it was a serious mess .
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
factor in the heat and it became a health hazard .
a little customer service goes a long way .
the crust was too thick and you could barely taste the calamari .
worst wings i have ever had .
it was that bad ... bar food at its worst .
we were seated immediately .
it was pretty noisy inside with the music and other noise .
i do n't eat bacon .
do n't get it if you do n't like the taste of beer .
i do n't know how you make a medium well burger that fast .
i can keep my money and spend it elsewhere though .
bouncer however , very rude and looked like he wanted to fight us .
horrible brewery .
just awful customer service .
you are a horrible corporate monster .
only giving one star because i ca n't give zero stars .
wings were good though , but it was hard to order them .
our waitress walked away from the table mid conversation , i was appalled .
very disappointed with this place on my most recent two visits .
called ahead to ensure he could get in with me , manager approved .
wasted time because of poor communication and inconsiderate employees .
they did away with garlic cheese beer bread ?
not wanting to wait for a table , we sat at the bar .
we got there at _num_ , was n't that busy .
i saw _num_ go by once i finished my meal .
i thought i was going to be sick .
carne asada tacos are beef marinated in soy sauce powder and brown sugar !
it was at the alcohol sugar stage already !
still having my husbands bday gathering here in a few weeks !
i informed him we were just trying to enjoy my visit .
said , `` i am an officer , you are a fucking private . ''
it 's loud , crowded , and loud !
there are security guards during the weekdays .
the first time my ex got food poisoning over a salad .
the second time , i had a hamburger and fries .
serve was quick , lots of beer options , and lots of condiments .
cheese on everything but the shit beer .
i do n't know what the deal was but our server was horrible .
very disappointed .
they should have comped that pizza .
unacceptable .
i would n't suggest eating here , there 's no reason to .
its hot as hell in here !
so very unfortunate since i wo n't be back .
now i can barely drink _num_ or _num_ at the bar .
this sucks because i like the food and love the staff at _num_ peaks .
_num_ stars otherwise .
unfortunately , there seems to be a turn in their business .
i ca n't explain what has happened , but it truly is sad .
hate the ambience , i 've been a few times .
too loud .
full disclosure though , not a beer fan in the first place .
i tried _num_ different beer styles here and all of them were very subpar .
fyi not friendly on the dog patio .
they do not really cater to food allergies .
i am not sure if the kitchen is in the same education .
they brought me a burger with bun and cheese so i sent it back .
my husband 's stomach got sick after eating their spinach & artichoke dip .
disappointing .
sounds so hard to screw up right ?
well it was disgusting .
the pickles were disgusting .
worst combination for a chicken sandwich .
so watered down you would n't need s water with your food .
terrible customer service and will not be returning .
no big deal .
there was tons of empty tables the entire hour we were there .
beer is sub par and the staff are extremely rude .
i tried three different beers here , and they were all not good .
the fans were on high making the place cold .
food was highly average and certainly not worth the wait .
this place used to be a lot better .
not sure where they are heading but it 's not good .
it really was horrible .
i only gave _num_ stars because the service was decent .
but i would n't venture back there again .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
four peaks , you need to train your employees on general people skills .
this used to be one of my favorite places .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
i can only imagine how he treats his poor employees !
i do n't think i 'll return to four peaks .
it 's so loud inside , so prepare for that .
sorry , four peaks .
but that did n't happen since the kitchen is closed .
this place is one of the worst sushi joints in town .
blah food .
tuna roll - overwhelming vinegar taste .
spicy scallops looked like cream corn and tasted like mayo + sriracha sauce .
and these were pretty basic selections - not the fancy rolls with _num_ ingredients .
that said , they were n't awful - but simply nothing memorable .
this place fails on both counts ... .
nigiri : fish was stale .
the rice was disgusting .
rolls : we did n't finish most of the rolls .
i was seriously going to write something a lot worse .
average food , average service , rude employees , high prices .
i ordered a seaweed salad , medium sashimi combo , and an iced tea .
for $ _num_ , i expect a lot more .
this happened to me not _num_ minutes ago .
( never mind the mediocre food ... . )
- the sushi is too small .
my god , it would take eight rolls to fill me .
i wanted to like you , sushi _num_ .
sushi _num_ was a borderline experience .
i was disappointed nobody came to her aid .
wow this place has gone down hill big time .
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
it was all bad .
the salad was bland except for the taste of bad tomato .
the spicy tuna did n't taste anywhere near fresh or right .
and the salmon which was just bad .
another piece was chewy and hard to get down .
so not authentic and a lot of the stuff does n't taste good .
spend your money somewhere else .
these douche bags made us pay our bill twice on sat .
yeah ... no .
it was gross , tasted old and bad fishy .
really ... people eat that crap ?
it tasted like butt .
it just did n't taste fresh .
worst sushi ive had in arizona !
the egg drop soup was old and tasted like feet .
the could use music , better lighting , and better service .
the bad : consistency is not common here .
i dont think i will return to sushi _num_ !
even the miso soup tasted like dirty salt water .
this is the worst sushi i have ever had .
on top of that the service was awful .
i hate to say it , but seriously ?
it was horrible .
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
the miso was nasty as well .
too many onions and the seaweed used in the soup was nasty .
plus , the service sucked .
i 'm never going here ever again .
sushi sucked .
oh , and the parking sucks too .
waited _num_ minutes for food to be served , on a quiet afternoon .
party of one , but they added _num_ % gratuity without consultation .
dingy atmosphere , not appetizing when you 're ordering raw fish .
do n't waste your time or money here .
i despise fake food .
leave it out altogether if the real thing is too expensive .
there is a lot more i could say but i think this is sufficient .
worst sushi ever .
i hate when sushi looks dried out right when you get it .
but hey , i 'm from ca .
i am not a huge fan but i have had worse .
my order was on a sunday so adjust your opinion accordingly .
when i stepped in to grab the order , the restaurant stunk .
to be fair , the order was ready and the employees were nice .
again , the same stinky smell followed me home through the order .
the rice was old and tasteless .
even the california roll i ordered was really bad .
i never thought anyone could make that one bad .
my husband and i ate here twice .
the first time , my husband was very pleased with his plate of albacore .
last night we gave this restaurant a second try and was not thrilled .
i ordered chicken teriyaki for $ _num_ and could not eat it .
the chicken was so dry and the food was cold when it came out .
the rice was hard and dry as well .
my husband order a plate of albacore again .
nothing special .
i guess i 'll post another review when we get our food .
the ambiance , however , was definitely lacking .
as a general rule , i avoid sushi in arizona .
the fish quality is usually pretty bad and this was no exception .
if i come again , i 'll probably get all vegetarian sushi .
finally , you have to pay $ _num_ for wasabi .
i have never in my life seen a sushi restaurant charge for wasabi .
just like yelp says , i have experienced better .
we were there _num_ minutes before the closing time .
the miso soup was very below average .
it had a fishy taste , which was awkward and did n't smell pleasant .
the service was pretty bland , nothing special .
prices were n't bad either .
overall , i probably wo n't be back in the near future .
wow terrible place here !
the host did n't acknowledge my group for at least five minutes .
our waiter would disappear & left us for _num_ mins after giving our bill .
not to mention we had to wait _num_ mins for three rolls of sushi .
sushi _num_ was a favorite of mine but it has become completely overpriced !
their sushi happy hour special are just a $ _num_ off .
if you want some nice sushi , stay away from this place .
all you get here is cheap cheap cheap for pretty expensive rolls and drinks .
this place is not worth the money or craving of sushi .
i left very unhappy .
i felt so uncomfortable .
all that has happened to me multiple times there .
also , their rice is almost always too dry .
seriously -- why bother .
no draft beer .
happy hour price is $ _num_ off ?
do a good one or dont bother to do one at all .
sushi is mediocre .
freshness is mediocre .
their quality of sushi , going straight down .
after looking at them i quickly lost my appetite .
wish i could say differently .
sad , this place used to be good .
but their sushi was just not good .
just did n't seem very fresh .
service was not too good either .
miso soup was cold .
sashimi tasted old .
did n't even eat half of my order .
it actually was one of the worst mixed drinks i 've ever had .
nothing my date ordered was very appetizing .
overall , their seafood tastes old and fishy .
gross , gross , gross .
just ... no .
slow service , gyoza came out cold .
i 'm disappointed this time here .
i ordered shrimp tempura they arrived soggy .
i spent about $ _num_ for _num_ people .
poor excuse for a restaurant .
showed up with a party of _num_ and they basically refused to seat us .
they do n't want your money .
rolls were not good and fish did n't taste fresh .
i 've never been , it 's close to my place ... why not ?
- the presentation of the rolls was horrible .
i mean i get it ... mistakes happen .
if i enjoyed the experience then the money would n't have been a consideration .
nope , this is n't a place for me .
we came here tonight , waited _num_ minutes for a server and left .
no one even looked at us .
the only plus was that they thanked us on the way out .
pretty disappointing if you ask me .
and like the salad it was just ok .
if i could give this place zero stars i would !
today was utter disappointment .
i should n't have to get up and ask where my order is .
they did n't even know they screwed up until i said something .
the manager did n't quite seem to feel too bad about what happened .
let me just start by saying i loved sushi _num_ until tonight .
other people simply got fed up & left .
as an employee of a very professional restaurant , i was shocked .
shame on you sushi _num_ , the worst restaurant experience i have ever had .
i remember the food being pretty decent , however the service was really sub-par .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
my soup was also cold and i literally only walked a block home .
the worst part was the service .
the girl that took my order was so rude !
philly cheesesteak not good .
cheap dried up luke warm meet .
not served as described on their menu .
i 've never liked going here , pretty terrible food and service .
i walked in around _num_ or so and the workers jumped up .
but still for _num_ bucks i think it should fill me up .
i regret giving a tip .
could n't even finish the food .
even still , i was n't really interested at that price .
i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .
yeah ... except for the $ _num_ worth of bull on the sticker price .
the customer service in the pro shop is terrible .
find a more friendly golf course unless you like bad customer service .
the machine was broken , friendly staff but busy to help right away .
the worst experience ever !
oh but it get 's worse .
i am so done with this plumbing company .
they have the worst customer service ever !
emergency and needed to get my tenant a working toilet .
then he said you owe me _num_ for pulling the toilet .
i wish there was a negative button .
he insisted that i needed to get work started right away .
today i went into here on the corner .
i dont suggest this is the place to put your hard earned money into .
i would be starving too if this is all i had to eat !
this used to be my favorite place to eat .
the chef came out 2-3 times to try to kill it .
so gross that you do n't see to care !
this was the worst food i ever had in my life .
if i could give this place a zero i would .
disgusting food .
just went there for apps and drinks and it was terrible .
all of the food was cold .
the crab taco special was marginal , very little crab .
the mini shrimp avocado tostadas were good but cold .
the soft tortilla fish tacos are usually pretty good but again cold .
the serving size are limited on the salsa and guacamole .
even with premium tequila they are just not made very well .
our server was terrible .
stay away from and find a street cart , seriously .
the shrimp was chewy , hard and terrible .
the chile relleno i had was close to inedible .
this place was horrible !
three words it sucked , sucked , sucked !
i used to love this place but this time i was very disappointed .
the grilled vegetable platter was just o.k .
worst part of all is the cornbread tasted `` flat '' .
my husband had a tasteless tortilla soup .
a bowl of soup , veggie platter , margherita and guacamole cost $ _num_ .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
seriously a limit of three ?
no other place in tempe seems to have such a stupid policy .
took over _num_ min to get awful , cold food .
`` banana muffin '' was vanilla cream cupcake ?
not worth the price .
i would not go back .
went for valentines day and was disappointed .
that table was there for _num_ minutes with no greet .
lucky for them no one slipped and fell .
unfortunately our experience will not lead us back there .
heavily disappointed when me and my friends went there for lunch .
so there we waited ... _num_ minutes for that freakin ' cobbler !
no berries !
it was an apple cobbler !
although i do n't care for chains , alas it served a purpose .
i was n't in the mood and i found it annoying .
gross !
they also charge $ _num_ for chips and salsa .
where the margaritas were twice the size for $ _num_ less .
then i ordered the salmon miso with rice and veggies .
it was n't even warm in the middle .
i let him know my salmon was way undercooked and the rice was hard !
he said sorry and that he would let the kitchen know .
did n't offer reduced check , dessert or anything .
never going back .
mediocre .
our waiter was nice but still a little clueless .
those folks were more polite , i felt this inconsiderate to their experience .
he was n't , trust me , i was a server for years .
not a good habit when the computer is in guest view .
these were over poured with alcohol and did n't taste good .
it was so long at that point i could n't stay .
it was insulting .
the manager comp 'd our drinks and said we were are free to go .
nothing special here .
food is n't bad but nothing to get excited about .
went there with some friends and probably wo n't go back .
have n't been here in a while and service not good tonight .
i had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time i got my salsa .
the food was average and the service was terrible .
well he obviously did not check my id clearly since it was my birthday .
appetizers came with our dinner which of course should n't .
disappointing .
they seemed small and empty .
just like every eatery , it is hit or miss with the service .
when we were finally served an hour later my meal was not not appetizing .
all in all a very disappointing experience .
the food was poor .
had to wait for service longer than usual .
it just was n't a positive experience .
i would n't go back .
after having marginal service we were less than impressed .
needless to say i 'm very disappointed in the professional standards of this restaurant .
still , it took _num_ minutes to get a table .
it all went downhill from there .
waiting forever for a table but the place was half full .
bathrooms were not stocked and filthy .
will not be back .
terrible service !
pretty much asking like it 's my fault that they did a terrible job .
wow , this was my first car wash and such a bad experience .
$ _num_ for literally less than _num_ minutes of work !
the men did not apply soap properly and did not dry properly .
rip off .
do n't fall for the lies .
i will trust no one .
i finally agreed to $ _num_ for a wash , wax , and detail .
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
he does not seem remotely interested in customer service .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
regret not having read yelp reviews prior to going .
the place is a complete scam .
they ended up charging me $ _num_ for a complete package .
i spent $ _num_ and was promised a full clean in and out .
no vacuum , no nothing !
i should have stopped him and made him redo the whole thing .
needless to say i 'm never going back .
please do not get your car washed or detailed here .
i agree with the previous bad reviews .
overall not really happy at all .
i probably wo n't go back again after this time .
customer service is pretty terrible .
the wax job was horrible .
i will not be going back again .
garbage they deserve _num_ stars !
this place sucks stay away .
i settled for an asian noodle dish with thin slices of grilled tofu .
now , they got rid of the veggie dumplings and have slow waiters .
unacceptable !
yay !
i do n't know why people hype this place so much .
the bread is usually stale .
subway is just as legit .
what do you expect from an entirely baked work force .
ugh .
this place is quite underwhelming .
at the time i did n't have time to wait for a remake .
that just did n't reverse my frustration .
however , a jimmy johns opened a mile or two down the street .
but this was over the top for even me .
i threw over half my sandwich away .
the staff was fine but unremarkable , no real complaint there .
the guy who made my sandwich was super awesome .
maybe it was business attire and i represented `` the man '' , man .
it always seems dirty inside .
the food , frankly sucks .
the meats were skimpy , salty and flavorless .
this place sucks .
dunno what that 's about but hey , i 'm new here .
i just ca n't do it .
the problem is the rudeness of the staff there .
music is extremely loud .
took us about _num_ min to place order which was fine ; rush hour .
went back to the staff and asked for my money back .
btw one of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich .
took us about _num_ min to place order which was fine ; rush hour .
went back to the staff and asked for my money back .
btw one of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich .
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
very very disappointed with their service !
tables are always a mess !
soda was flat both times we went .
i am only _num_ miles away .
we ended up leaving and hopefully they know how to refund my money .
do not go to cheba hut !
two bad experiences are enough , i 'll eat elsewhere from now on .
this location is really awesome some times and other times it 's pretty lousy .
i was very disappointed after that .
if you want to try the food , forget delivery .
but an hour later , still no delivery of the sauce .
by the way , we never did get that sauce delivery .
apparently its my job to make sure they correctly do their job .
apparently it was my bad .
you just lost my business .
still not sure why the first guy even took my order .
it looked nothing like what i have come to expect .
so ... what 's going on with cheba hut ?
too bad .
seriously the worst cheba hut ever .
it made no sense .
i could n't even finish my french dip the meat was so flavorless .
first time they did n't put any veggies on it .
just roast beef , cheese and jalapeno sour cream it comes with .
terrible experience today !
man was i wrong !
i ca n't hate on that .
come on cheba hut , i need your food in my life .
unfortunately these people have absolutely no idea what they are doing !
so i must be crazy that they have been here so many times before .
i live _num_ miles away !
how effing ridiculous .
so you just lost your employees money as well .
it 's onto minute _num_ .
worst customer service .
food is questionable .
this one is not on the ball .
no , but their communication is .
whatever needs to be said can be in an email or message .
no stars cheba hut .
so disappointing .
it is nothing that i would rave about .
i have had better chicken sandwiches elsewhere .
now they wo n't deliver .
do not get the salad .
the salads are a complete joke .
horrible service ... cashiers act like complete morons .
very frustrating to deal with .
employees ca n't get the order right and they ruined the tempe location .
mesa location is soooooo much better .
i completely understand how frustrating that can be .
she let me know that it would be about _num_ minutes to an hour .
it 's april _num_ , which of course means this place would be busy .
that would be far better than ignoring calls and rudely telling off potential customers .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
one of the boys says , `` i think i lost my appetite . ''
the others were laughing .
they called my name to grab my order .
service there is rude !
but when it comes to customer service it really lacks .
they do n't hustle to help you or make orders .
i do not recommend them to anyone .
oh no garlic bread ran out .
i was there _num_ minutes and no one made a move to clean anything .
just dry tacos , cold beans and so-so rice .
if i could give dish _num_ i would .
i had a gyro pita -- authentic , i know .
friends had the roast beef and chicken crave .
i also remembered the pitas have more in them and being better tasting overall .
i called the number twice and it just rang and rang .
_num_ minutes later : no drinks , no pita .
only , its like subway for pitas .
the pita is supposed to hold the food , not just be around it .
guess they must not need the business .
unfortunately , this location has some serious issues .
the management should teach their employees phone etiquette .
the employees do not know what they are doing .
my pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me .
they did n't even wrap our pita 's in pita bread !
instead we got dry tortillas ... at pita pit .
and a super huge disappointment , what the heck !
no pitas , at pita pit ?
this place used to be _num_ stars to me .
i hate dr. pepper , threw it away .
this is not the first time i have been disappointed in this store .
stopped in to buy a couple bags of ice .
i wo n't go out of my way to come here again .
i got a bunch of breakfast food and basically the whole order was wrong .
it was like something a super drunk person would fix at 4am .
it 's fairly bland , heavy on the cheese and sauce .
after waiting a while , i would just leave .
a so-so wrap with so-so customer service and no bathrooms .
i 've had a few , but none were good .
when i arrived at the airport , i called the hotel for a shuttle .
when i got to the terminal , i called again .
it got really busy here , i am sorry '' .
bad experience in and of itself .
the room was smelly .
obviously plenty of people have smoked in that smoke free room .
and the air conditioning stopped working at night making it extremely hot .
overall , i was quite disappointed .
did n't get to stay .
he insisted i put my bag in the back of the van .
we wo n't be staying here again .
sadly disappointed .
our trip next year we will not be picking this hotel again .
sometimes customer service goes a long way and this place has none .
when we first checked in the hotel clerk was not very welcoming .
needless to say we 'll never stay here again !
i woke up sweaty and it was n't that hot of a day .
they gave me a key to someone 's room !
room number two was n't made up or cleaned .
there were cigarette burns throughout the room .
what an awful place .
avoid at all costs .
the room was large , but it was n't well appointed and very bland .
he did n't like the beds and did n't sleep well .
for the traveler on a budget , it would probably work fine .
the word is certainly too soft compare to the way she talked to me !
so i have been robbed and insulted !
horrible people !
definitely not a place to stay with the amount i paid .
the place looks like it needs a major makeover .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
it was crowded there so i started gathering my stuff .
plastic container , which is a cheap plastic piece of junk .
this is a terrible policy for any store .
this place just lost all of my future business over a $ _num_ return .
i refuse to support a business that does n't have reasonable customer service policies .
my comment was removed as well .
it looks like they even have cheese making supplies .
disgusting .
gary and i went to mill on sunday .
gary had the bacon , egg and cheese sandwich and chilli cheese fries .
the cheese on my cheese fries was not melted .
a few hours later my stomach was hurting so much .
i thought i was going to die ... and spent the night throwing up .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
this one is simply a disappointment .
i 've never been to such a slow fatburger .
do n't come unless you have lots of time .
its kind of depressing , especially after you get all clogged with fatburger .
i had no choice but to eat here ... we were meeting friends .
i got the thick cut fries , thinking they 'd be good ... wrong .
they sucked - period .
one word sums this place up ... avoid !
did n't really care for the atmosphere .
very forgettable and bland .
i ca n't stand these things .
like another poster said , they just make me hungry for in-n-out .
compared to other burgers this place falls way short , sadly i was disappointed !
it 's just a greasy pile of mess .
the service was good here they greeted you as you walked in and left .
it was a solid waste of _num_ $ .
i am a mac user and so are a million other people .
rio has been one of the worst learning experiences i have ever had .
their biggest problem is the online material .
i really only took classes here to transfer them to asu .
if you can , pick another place to get your education .
every term i have taken there has been an utter and complete disaster .
do not trust anyone you speak to on the phone .
literally feels like half of a school .
do n't take this school too seriously .
went here for one term , and would never do it again .
i 'm grateful i did n't waste money on a math class here !
four years later i try to give the college another try .
no thank you idiots .
i will never attempt to go to this crappy college again .
the most incompetent financial aid staff i have ever came across .
_num_ requests later they were finally sent .
rio is a bummer , they need to figure things out .
not so fast .
why didnt you tell my wife this _num_ mins before ?
never accept the unacceptable .
i wish i could give this `` college '' a negative review .
i deeply regret not doing my homework and reading the reviews beforehand .
i was very wrong .
apparently you can not do part b of week _num_ during part a .
i do n't think you will regret your decision .
never ever even consider this so called college .
the worst experience of my life .
they absolutely ruined my excitement to go back to college .
that 's how badly they ruined it for me !
this has been the worst customer service experience i have ever had .
try to find something better is my next plan .
i 'm not even sure where to begin .
oops , she forgot to email me .
and she informed me she is leaving rio and assigned me a new advisor .
i have never encountered such shoddy professionalism and i work in higher education !
they are a terrible barrier .
who knew changing a career would be this difficult .
i truly wish i could give less than one star .
truly an unfortunate experience .
it 's just bad .
this place is horrible !
then after waiting an advisor finally called me back and was not very personable !
parking is a nightmare .
the lines are ridiculous .
the two classes i took were horrible .
the content itself was from high school , nothing new .
i did n't know my opinion piece could be wrong ?
at least , thats what i had been taught throughout my educational career .
worked on it for a total of _num_ hours on it .
this is a terrible college .
this is by far the worst community college within the maricopa college district .
if i could give it zero stars , i would have .
i know from experience this is a terrible school .
no , you ca n't make everyone happy .
this facility is awful .
also , the staff are pretty rude .
if you 're in the phoenix area , try a different maricopa college .
this one is horrible .
they wo n't even return a phone call .
really disappointed .
these guys are terrible i dont recommend them .
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .
they have terrible customer care .
i am completely turned off by their student services dept .
i would not go here for classes , though .
unprofessional and rude experience .
i am completely turned off by their student services dept .
i would not go here for classes , though .
unprofessional and rude experience .
not so much .
it was depressing school !
was happier at a university even though i did not have a chosen major .
if i had a chance , i would of gone elsewhere .
i only came here for the training , very depressing experience .
i was very disappointed .
i was extremely disappointed .
i completed the course feeling upset , hurt and angry .
i should have believed them from the start .
_num_ dollars for a mens hair cut that 's subpar ?
after the color was washed out she cut literally two pieces of hair .
she did n't even trim all the ends or anything .
i was so confused .
donna worked on my hair for _num_ hours and a half .
i just came from salon and felt bad and disappointed .
i do not recommend this salon .
i just left as soon as i could .
i gave them several chances to improve and they never did .
to be fair , this place would benefit from an update .
if you like a dark room , this is not your place .
if you like a clean rug , this is not your place .
i really do n't know how to write a review for food city .
more so then i would have liked .
i walked the store twice .
no freakin rice .
unacceptable !
wow i can not believe what just seen , heard & been through .
i stopped cooking and dumped out all the chicken .
but have n't yet complained .
my biggest complaint , by far , is how bad the noise carries .
additionally , i can hear the person upstairs .
small rooms , recently updated , make for a comfortable stay .
disappointing stay for a hilton diamond member .
this was nothing like the other hampton inn 's we 've previously stayed in .
the room was very small but it was clean .
not a hampton inn we will recommend .
yes i have stayed in better .
the a/c unit was loud and it did keep me up .
the breakfast this morning was not the best .
i threw away the eggs and potatoes .
they were not fit to eat .
the awesome blossom !
it 's the establishment doing away with the establishment .
sat down , was greeted by the waitress immediately and ordered my drink .
the 1st time it was ordered it was burnt and folded very strange .
did n't taste good at all .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
service was slow .
chili 's food is bland .
bad service .
blech .
you 're gon na need it .
as for the food , never had it .
service was beyond horrible .
yet when we decided to leave , we could not find our server anywhere .
there , fixed it for them .
the kobe sliders could have been better .
i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty .
the food is n't that great .
cool , whatever , brewery .
beer battered fish and chips - the fish was not beer battered .
it was too much and kind of bland .
the portions of the food were pretty ridiculous .
no stars for the drinks , the food , and the price .
yes they have good brews but the atmosphere is not the same .
the food not as good and the staff not as professional .
the place was not busy at all .
after waiting for nearly _num_ minutes , we left .
there are many good places to eat on mill , so skip this one .
the menu is like an upgraded applebees .
generally , i 'll avoid if at all possible .
our waitress , ( lauren ) knew the beer , was very attentive .
and more bacon , and something that was supposed to be ranch .
i found the beer menu surprisingly limited and uninspired .
my friend and i were both disappointed with our ( $ _num_ ! )
did we say something wrong or did we look at the waitress wrong ?
the food is quite honestly , meh .
the service each time i have visited has been terrible .
inattentive servers , empty glasses , empty plates .
it is a shame that such a good restaurant had such terrible service .
really , do n't .
she did that twice and no i did n't really appreciate it .
so we sit down and place our orders .
it 's 6:30 now on thursday night and we are the only table .
chicken sandwich was inedible .
there really was n't much taste , just salty .
i would n't be surprised if this spot is called something else next year .
i would n't reccomend it for more than maybe the beer and garlic fries .
you wo n't be disappointed !
however , the hostess refused to seat us in the dining room .
this set a very negative tone for the rest of our meal .
not the quality i expected .
there r lots of other restaurants on mill ave that are far better .
of all the restaurants i have been to this is the worst .
food was really expensive .
skimpy skimpy pours on wine , almost ridiculously so .
food was mediocre .
we order the beer sample which did n't require those types of glasses .
got food poisoning off a simple caesar salad .
worst food poisoning i 've ever seen .
if you do go , do n't get a salad .
in our party of _num_ , the service was slow & not very attentive .
the fries were just fine but the steak was pitiful .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
first time here for a party off _num_ after passing many times on mill .
we left , made sure the manager knew .
the service was very slow .
the chicken california flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning !
hell no !
they quickly left .
my son 's 1/2 pound burger was supposed to be medium ... nope .
my gorgonzola rib eye was supposed to be medium rare ... again , nope .
my daughter 's salad was completely forgettable .
not to us .
upon speaking the restaurant they did n't care .
it was bland , no flavor .
the garlic fries were n't much better .
just stick to beer .
so what happened to this place !
the menu was so dang dirty i did n't want to touch it !
$ _num_ bucks for a okay salad with a bit of chicken .
most likely from working on mill for too long .
they do not clean the tables out there .
there was old food dried up on tables also no misters .
the bathroom is dirty and smells like stale water .
has _num_ dusty old tv 's outside .
she ordered a chopped salad and i ordered a kobe beef hamburger .
happy hour prices were not honored on the patio .
we probably will not go back .
went on sunday , the place was relatively quiet with maybe _num_ tables filled .
the waitress was rude , extremely slow and not helpful at all .
over horrible experience .
my husband and i shared the california flat bread .
there were _num_ college students working tonight for about _num_ parties of customers .
overall we had a terrible experience and it was an awful $ _num_ spent .
first time guests , and have been ignored for .
oh and they do not validate the parking .
fail .
both the food and the beer are unremarkable .
the only cool thing about he place is the patio overlooking mill ave .
bummed that this place sucked so bad !
how can you mess up tacos ?
i do n't get it .
awful service and unremarkable food .
how does someone mess up a brownie ?
unbelievable .
it 's one less ingredient and should , therefore , take less time .
waited almost _num_ minutes to initially get waited on at our table outside .
gave us waters without asking .
it 's a wednesday night and it 's not even half way packed .
horrible service .
did n't really say sorry or offer discounts or anything .
mediocre food and a bartender that does n't know how to make martini !
huge disappointment .
not anymore .
i was very disappointed with the service at this restaurant location .
the worst service however came from our waiter , who was extremely slow !
crap cheap food .
crap drinks .
service is extremely slow and the food is pricey .
this was n't the worst stay i have ever had in a hotel .
i only stayed for one night on business .
the room , however , was not .
the floor was not vacuumed .
it was clearly gross .
some would say that i should have demanded a different room .
overall , this place seems like it is in a questionable area of tempe .
i would not go walking around at night .
it looks good from the outside , but my room was a mess .
but my stay actually went quite smooth .
i wo n't stay here again unless absolutely necessary .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
we 've been here _num_ nights and had to change rooms _num_ times .
they are a little lax on the housekeeping as well .
furniture missing .
furniture handles missing .
two remaining chairs badly stained .
you would n't want to sit on them .
no uniforms or name tags on staff .
the customer service is soooo soooo poor !
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
the `` game room '' is not a game room .
all these things , i could get over .
he is an embarrassment to all of us who work in guest services .
you would have a better stay in a box outside on a corner .
you get what you pay for ... and worse !
i am not just some college girl who wants a tattoo on spring break .
wow that was rude .
now you lost a potential customer .
ummm , not my problem .
asu , you suck .
it sucked to park .
this place was a nightmare !
that gave me another headache and a half .
its not worth it .
thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes i need .
they are not informed enough to advise you .
gross !
asu is not the most safe neighborhood .
i have been approached by many shady people .
they are beyond crappy and overpriced .
if you go expecting anything more than that , you 'll be extremely disappointed .
the quality of education is lacking at best , and laughable at worst .
make no mistake about it .
im tired of playing these games .
all he said was no and i had closed the chat window .
i was given the wrong phone number for an advisor ( complete accident ) .
i could go on and on .
if you have half a brain , choose someplace else .
he was not listed .
the school is n't bad unless you need something from them .
asu online is a scam !
if you do n't , they send it to collections .
if i could honestly give asu a lower rating i would !
horrible ... horrible ... horrible .
terrible admission system !
i would n't be going here if it were n't for my classes .
u of a was much better for me personally .
school is lackluster and is really profit driven .
unfortunately , asu is incredibly profit driven for a state school .
it is just a nightmare .
i would n't recommend doing their online education program .
no apology whatsoever .
no wonder this place is never busy .
horrible experience !
nothing like i asked for .
well i was unable to do that since i was leaving for vacation .
so we are basically screwed out of our _num_ $ .
i later find out she was having lunch on my time .
all in all i will never go back !
so i sat down and waited ... and waited ... and waited .
none of the other stylists said anything ... do i walked out .
bad service ... took my business elsewhere ... would recommend the same .
i was with a group and check-in is always at _num_ pm .
we arrived at _num_ pm and only _num_ of the rooms were available .
there was garbage floating in the bottom and true pond scum floating there .
run down room decor , no hair dryer in bathroom .
when we got to the room , our keys did n't work .
all in all we paid _num_ dollars for _num_ hours use of the room .
will never stay here again , and neither should you !
we were offered a _num_ % discount for inconvenience , which was not enough !
the customer is not always right here , go elsewhere !
it turns out there are a lot of restaurants within short walking distance .
however , directly across the road is a very large power plant .
this is an old worn out hotel .
our room did n't have a mini fridge .
it would have been useful to have one .
the worst things about the room were the bed and pillows .
i could n't get comfortable .
i did n't sleep well .
this place is gross .
it looks run down on the outside .
the pool looks really gross , would n't suggest going in it .
did n't look like anything i would want to sleep in .
blanket has holes in it and the sheets were yellow at the ends .
literally nothing here seemed clean .
it was also hard to wash my hair because of the low water pressure .
glad i only had to stay one night because this place was awful .
i am now changing my opinion .
well after one sip of the second beer , i knew it was nasty .
the man working gave me strange looks and never apologized .
however , since then , this store appears to have given up .
too long ; did n't read ?
this store 's beer is _num_ % expired .
horrible customer service and high prices .
this guy clearly does n't care about doing right by his customers .
the bed was quite comfy as were the pillows , so that was great .
breakfast was ok , but nothing special .
the pools were n't quite right .
the other _num_ were freezing cold .
a lot of people made comments about it , not just us .
it was just a horrible experience !
thanks for not helping me tonight after getting stranded in phoenix airport .
probably one of the worst hotel experiences i 've ever had .
worst hotel experience ever !
do n't stay at this hotel .
they offered me another room in the same hotel .
sorry , not acceptable .
terrible conditions .
trash cans overflowing , juice spilled on floor ignored .
front desk does n't pick up the phone and no manager on duty .
i had about _num_ bites all over my body !
horrible service !
this place does n't even deserve _num_ star .
i booked a room thru expedia for a friday night .
i have stayed at this hotel before .
they lost my business and my recommendation over $ _num_ .
avoid !
this location had bed bugs and would not refund me .
unbelievable .
worst hotel i 've ever been to .
no way in hell i 'll ever go back .
room _num_ i 'll never forget .
said it would be another _num_ min .
and then another _num_ .
this went on for _num_ hrs .
my 8th day at this place , three more to go .
apparently , this is happened to many people at the property .
but no one seemed to care that much , was on my own .
needless to say , i will not be coming back to this hospital .
the longest wait time posted was _num_ minutes .
the bed they had put me in was soaked with urine .
ugh .
id never go to this hospital again .
basically saying nothing was wrong with him .
i had to call _num_ tonight because he could n't breath .
i never want to go to this hospital again .
worst experience ever .
they ignored me and came to find out i was allergic to it .
they also have horrible tv service , wtf ?
i am a patient , i dont want to hear how cheap they are .
this is a horrible one .
this hospital is horrible .
they did nothing for my daughter .
i agree with the other bad reviews .
it 's old , smelly and dirty .
also my dr was pretty awesome you do not really see them much though !
which is why i forgot .
then i realized why people shut their doors !
it went on for hours and then i personally lost my shit .
that sucked too .
i ca n't believe that they call themselves a hospital .
what type of hospital has an emergency room so dirty ?
instead of getting treatment , i walked out .
those health care employees need to spend some time cleaning up the hospital .
a hospital should be safe and clean not dirty and unhealthy .
the hospital looks very old and dirty .
the staff is flakey and very difficult to get a hold of .
horrible doesnt begin to describe it .
three year old had an eye emergency .
waited _num_ hours to find out he has pink eye .
also , do n't touch anything in here .
so i will try and keep this short .
so we were sent here by urgent care .
we waited _num_ hours in the lobby .
i was tossed out of er as if nothing was wrong .
this hospital deserves no stars !
avoid at all costs !
i woke up from my injury face down on my bed .
but i 'd rather drive or go elsewhere , emergency or not .
worst experience .
had horrible unbearable chest pain .
they made me i had no right to be there .
did n't care about pain .
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
alright i do n't complain about much ... no really !
the car i got was not washed .
extremely disappointed !
overall attitude of employees at this location was irritating .
they act like they 're doing you a favor by renting to you .
enterprise has definitely gone downhill !
will i rent from enterprise in the future ?
i live _num_ miles from the location .
i was treated very poorly by this location and will never use enterprise .
i really hate this branch of pita jungle .
unacceptable .
i do n't like this place at all .
its not that good if you ask me .
and not that cheap either .
the outdoor seating is really sidewalk seating next to the parking lot and cars .
would vote lower if the option were available .
unfortunately , the service is deplorable .
the tempe location seems to have a worse track record .
sometimes the tuna salad will have _num_ lbs .
sometimes the rice is hot , sometimes it 's cold .
sometimes the dressing tastes tangy , other times it 's salty .
they frequently forget to put the cucumbers in the burrito as well .
however the prices are n't that cheap .
_num_ star on a bad day , _num_ stars on a good day .
the food is not bad , but it 's so boring .
they have seven ingredients , yet _num_ dishes .
bad ?
split tongue , etc .
the service was not awesome .
my falafel was mediocre .
i will not be back any time soon .
what a disappointment .
the bad : time from seating to water was _num_ minutes .
service pace bad .
an additional _num_ minutes until food arrived .
soup arrived and entree immediately followed .
we arrived and the hostess was rude and had no idea we were coming .
there was n't anyone there so they set up a table for us .
however , my experiences at pita jungle have been far from glowing .
i like the concept of pita jungle , i have just had better .
the pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about .
using their online ordering system is a complete waste of time .
how tacky .
we will not be ordering from pita jungle again .
everything else is ok , but why do they do that .
it makes it disgusting .
i honestly think pita jungle is just mediocre and over priced .
i always seem to end up disappointed by the time i walk out .
my last two visits have been for brunch , perhaps that was my downfall .
they really do not do brunch well .
if you are using eggs , egg whites are part of them .
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .
chicken sausages are awesome !
up until recently i ordered take out _num_ times a week .
once again i waited on hold for _num_ minutes before i gave up .
they were one of my favorite eateries .
so , we ended up getting the cilantro jalapeno hummus and some tzatziki .
yeah no , we will just pay cash and leave .
gross !
we will not be going to this location again .
very bad experience .
ordered spicy chicken wrap and it was so soggy that it just fell apart .
i feel bad wasting food but this was not what i imagined at all .
well , apparently , this staff did n't think it deserves any .
another customer arrived before me & another right behind me .
so , i decided to wait since it was already up .
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
instead , he brought a customer 's food ( who just arrived ) .
i 've never , ever left a restaurant without my food before .
the food is n't that good to go through all of this hassle .
i wo n't be back .
i swear it 's a _num_ minute wait every ... single ... time .
line _num_ people deep and not moving .
avoid this bank if you are in any sort of hurry .
only one teller with at least _num_ people in line and building mid morning .
no customer service .
the wait just to see a teller is always a minimum of _num_ minutes .
this is the absolute worst bank location i 've ever been to .
this is a rip off !
showed up on time and that is the only thing positive .
ruined my carpet .
barely spoke english .
i could not be more upset right now .
i would rather have my old carpet back .
it 's like it was n't even cleaned .
thanks for nothing .
i hate this place so so much .
but i still hate it so so much .
the parking situation is what gets me the worst .
what the hell is wrong with these people ?
the next thing is the drink prices which are typically lousy for phoenix shows .
_num_ dollars for a draft beer .
but i 'm not even done yet .
almost all of the shows i have seen here have been extremely pedestrian .
the only exception would be the faint shows that i 've seen there .
this place sucks .
the sound quality sucks and the shows are expensive .
they rip you off .
drinks are a rip too .
and for the most part crap bands play here .
i hate the marquee .
hate it .
i hate the parking .
i hate the sound .
why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me ?
your sound sucks - seriously sucks .
i 've heard they are easy to run in to ) .
the parking arrangement is stupid , to put it plain and simple .
thus , my friend was obliged with about _num_ free shows at the venue .
sound still sucked though , as i was told .
him -- sound was terrible .
now we 're best buds and my brother hates me .
i was like `` i 'll get by with no problem .
i 'll leave my wallet chain in my car . ''
certainly not the trash .
that would be ridiculous , throwing money away .
oh shit , i said that out loud , huh ?
fuck , i 'll just buy the ticket anyway .
was there a shooting here or something , because this is ridiculous .
this is a horrible venue .
bought them at the window and still paid _num_ bucks each in fees !
the acoustics were not very good in my opinion .
marquee has none of the above .
many bands sound somewhat marginal there because the acoustics are just not very good .
if they kick you out , you deserve it !
parking sucks .
it costs money to park and they do n't have many spaces .
i 've heard better , not often do i hear worse .
drinks are a rip off !
fuck it .
oh well that was awhile ago and i have went back reluctantly since then .
take my shoes off ?
the show was good though , sound is n't too bad .
the marquee is not how one should work .
idiots .
it is n't that hard .
maybe i 'm just getting old .
the sound however was not so great .
the marquee was all i expected it to be except for the sound .
guess how much effing showed up on my charge card ?
fees , fees , and more fees .
ridiculous .
i was n't charged an extra fee either when i picked up my ticket .
parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
i effing hate this place !
i will only come here for a band i just can not miss .
lines & waiting - i did n't have to wait at all .
drinks - there 's a bar & they do n't separate people under _num_ .
there was _num_ lousy fan blowing .
it might as well not even have been there .
fail .
nothing positive to say about this venue .
i am always disappointed when a band i love plays here .
i cant miss it !
i basically hate every single thing about this place .
its hot , dirty , the bathroom situation is a disaster .
been here many times come to think of it too many times .
like i 'd want to lie and be this old lol .
do not go here unless you absolutely need to see a band .
hot , hot , hot , in a bad way .
sound , was mediocre at best .
the marquee in tempe is a joke !
if you 're over _num_ do n't go there !
it was awful .
this is not a place for pretty women .
do n't wear heels to this place .
ok i 'm done .
but there was n't much awesome about the experience .
no wonder i woke up with a headache .
what is extremely frustrating are the bartenders !
they do n't even try to move quickly or efficiently .
it sucks because it 's basically take what you can get here in arizona .
i mean way worse than tsa !
this place sucks hard !
my recent experience at the marquee theatre was essentially like every other reviewers .
also the security to get inside is ridiculous .
the marquee sucks .
since my original review , i 've been to a few other shows here .
the place just get 's worse and worse .
i wish i could take it back when i said that security is friendly .
they 're really not .
drinks and fees cost too much money .
i 'm not _num_ and i 'm not stupid .
sadly , there is another show tonight that i really want to go to .
this place does not deliver .
until this place is under new management , they have lost my business .
this rule will never fail you .
i will never return no matter how badly i want to see the act .
once inside , there was a very foul odor .
the theater inside is exactly like being at a rave in an abandoned warehouse .
so try not to think about the fact that you paid to be here .
first off let me say , i have been to many shows here .
i do n't understand how they can not have my will call tickets !
i wish i could give less than one star .
marquee theater is the worst place to see concerts in the phoenix area .
the owners are so cheap they never turn the ac on .
do yourself a favor and skip this venue .
you 're not allowed a refund if you disagree with it either .
but it 's enough to never return .
you 'll spend more here than you will at dodge theater .
complaints aside , the place was n't a total wash .
gross .
bathroom disgusting .
gross .
no seating .
doors opening & show starting are not the same thing .
limited parking .
_num_ bars .
parking was $ _num_ .
for two of us the total was $ _num_ .
did n't know i was going to an international airport .
the bartender said `` nothing . ''
which makes me angry .
parking is crap .
i could n't find a spot initially because the lot was so full .
i ca n't believe i had to pay for this .
you get the full pat down .
you need to empty your pockets too .
i hate being treated like an animal .
alcohol is expensive .
the theater has no seating as well .
i have skipped out on several shows hosted by the marquee .
i hate that place and hate giving them my hard earned dollar .
they 're driving your customers away !
as others have said , security sucks , and the bathrooms are gross .
would it kill them to turn on the ac ?
do n't worry if you have a long wait though .
the band wo n't start without you because no one ever starts before 9pm .
just play it safe and stick with bottled water .
however , this place really does suck .
the simple reason is that the sound quality is terrible .
the sound guy needs to realize this is an enclosed space and adjust accordingly .
acoustics are poor as well as the ventilation in the place .
that being said , i attempted to attend a show there recently .
she 's not three years old !
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
before last may , i had n't been to the marquee since _num_ .
let 's count the ways in which the marquee theater sucks .
second , they obviously do n't know how to run a will call line .
that 's not exactly a recipe for a long line .
over by the side wall it sounded like a mess .
seriously run the ac you 're so cheap .
or probably not since the air was n't blowing .
what a dump , bands if you ever read this do not play here .
the only thing marquee has going for it is size .
this is my least favorite venue in arizona .
bathrooms are always dirty , every single time .
i would give this zero stars if i could .
this is the worst venue i have ever been to !
i ca n't express how much i hate the marquee !
_num_ ) security to get in is a little bit of a pain .
he did n't even move .
they are angry and mean .
_num_ ) it 's outrageously expensive to do anything there .
tickets come with the worst fees .
( it used to be $ _num_ ) .
sodas , beers , drinks , and even water bottles are all overpriced .
_num_ ) most importantly , their sound is horrible !
do n't waste your money going to the marquee .
do not support this business !
while there my boyfriend was pushed from behind .
to top everything off the band told me the only got paid $ _num_ .
tickets were $ _num_ and the place was packed .
avoid at all cost !
i enjoyed the bands playing but the marquee is ridiculous .
ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .
overpriced , piss warm brews and sound work could have been better .
never ever returning .
really a shame because this venue could be amazing .
terrible sound .
terrible lighting .
you can not be serious .
the marquee just plain stinks .
sound = terrible .
staff = horrible .
come prepared with unbelievably low expectations , and , you might just enjoy yourself .
i was disappointed with the ticket price .
wish there was n't a fence in front of stage .
does n't make it fun .
which sucks .
lame .
it is in a really cramped area .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
no complaints there .
just looked into getting tickets for show here .
$ _num_ tickets .
_num_ % added on for fees .
over $ _num_ to buy them .
ridiculous .
this place is a ripoff .
baseline price when you purchase a ticket is around $ _num_ .
no thanks !
i 've had it , and i 'll never go again .
save yourself some grief avoid marquee theater .
i want to put _num_ stars .
the _num_ % is hella grumpy .
she most def hates her life !
their phone etiquette is not pleasant .
that 's not counting the surrounding people that were by some chance still standing .
but yet they made me throw out my gum at the door .
a miserable experience that started before we were even in the parking lot .
$ _num_ parking across the street .
i do n't like being felt up .
do not go to this venue .
i repeat ... do not go to this venue .
i know i 'm not a regular .
but i also am not a jerk .
couple of complaints with this place ; bartenders are not friendly .
sort of looks like he just got out of prison .
apparently they get very annoyed when you do this .
obviously they could use some work on their staff though .
there was no ac .
it was hell .
it 's truly a shame that many of my favorite artists play here .
what a waste of time and money .
thought the guy was going to have a heart attack .
however , we wo n't be back .
service sucked , their staff is rude , and the place is a dive .
thought we were in tempe not south phoenix ... its really sad too .
they just need to get their staff in order .
however , the venue is n't the best by any means .
there was no warning when i bought tickets for this venue .
and what a shock to see that there were no seats .
it was a horrible experience ; my worst concert to date .
i guess i should 've looked at the venue reviews first .
just to find inside that there is no seating anywhere .
there is no way we will be back .
one of the worst venues to see a concert .
this standing up for 2-3 hours to see a concert is crap !
there is no sound conditioning whatsoever in this place .
complete bs .
i am so disappointed .
i would n't go here unless you really ca n't miss the band .
this is got to be the worst venue i have ever been to .
it 's basically a brick shell , it has absolutely zero character .
standing room only .
even the acoustics were bad .
whoever runs this place needs to take it easy .
not to get in fights .
i would not return to this venue .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
would rate lower than _num_ star if possible .
rude and an incompetent personnel .
i will not return to that venue !
the sound quality at this venue is truly awful .
the security is awful at this venue .
the sound system is terrible .
i can not wait for them to change management and hire new security staff .
not worth the money for two simple reasons .
terrible .
imagine this experience a minimum of _num_ times per show .
once i got in the door , i was very disappointed .
$ _num_ a head to sit on a freakin ' bench ?
are you kidding me ?
apparently , we were important but not that important .
i was disappointed when they stopped doing it .
bottom line - do n't waste your money on vip .
by far , the worst music venue in the valley .
the employees are jerks of a special type .
what the hell kind of bs is that ?
what am i _num_ years old ?
on top of this there was a no picture rule .
lame .
it was so bad we left early .
wasted $ , wasted evening .
this is n't a small amount of money to most working folks .
its the venues , and sometimes the people surrounding them that do n't care .
horrible .
which is too bad .
idk how many more words i can come up for just plan sucks .
if i could give this venue zero stars , i would .
avoid shows at this venue !
deserves zero stars .
that 's _num_ hours after doors opening .
unacceptable !
i travel for business all then time and this was not handled correctly .
there was a woman 's hair in the bathroom too when i checked in !
horrible front desk .
false claims of the shuttles to downtown .
horrible horrible .
poor customer service .
alas , the best i could get was _num_ shots of espresso over ice .
_num_ ) ambience .
this is actually my number one problem with mill 's end .
the coffee is reasonably priced , but the food is too expensive .
the staff has always been just lukewarm .
while i do like the environment here , i really dislike the slow service .
my friend 's beef tasted almost like filipino adobo .
still do not like the service here .
also , the portions here are less than the portions i get elsewhere .
_num_ this is college town _num_ .
sorry to be such a snob but truly this food was just okay .
i will not go back again .
as we walked to the table the hostess was not happy to seat us .
unfortunately , lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best .
more bang for your buck .
we also got a bottle of yellow tail merlot @ ~ $ _num_ .
both our food and our wine came out very quickly .
it 's not as if the place was busy .
sure , we knew there were waitresses .
this is completely unacceptable for any restaurant .
no `` how 's the food ? ''
no refills on waters .
lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes .
went for the meat dishes , not sure how the vegetarian plates are .
i would n't eat it either if it was all i had .
service is very bad and slow .
when we asked asked for the straws she literally threw them on the table .
and the food was served to us after _num_ mins .
we had beef , chicken , salad and vegetarian dishes .
horrible injera , it was not warm or fresh at all .
ok , here 's the deal .
pizza is horrible .
i hate it .
i do not understand why people like this place .
the pizza is close to inedible .
it definitely caters to college kids -- cheap eats and open past bar closing .
no utensils were delivered and the salad was a costly mess .
it 's not much for `` new york '' style pizza .
their large pizza is huge , but their crust is flavorless .
it 's weird .
in terms of customer service , they 're less than stellar ... for sure .
my boss would n't eat anything else !
i would recommend pizza hut over gus 's ... any day .
the wings are mediocre .
i only eat here if it 's 2am and my neighbor wants pizza .
the pizza was cheap and tasted pretty good .
i think our affair with gus is over .
came out to $ _num_ with tax .
when the guy came to the door he said it was $ _num_ .
there was a $ _num_ delivery fee !
the pizza was horrible .
the wings were disgusting .
the pizza here is horrible .
the delivery guys will never bring the pizza to my door .
my roommate can throw up in the toilet _num_ hours a day .
i 'm not sure i can tell the difference .
gus 's never ever surprises me anymore .
they have all these crazy little charges for everything you can think of .
do n't know never eaten in .
i did n't know pizza could taste this bad .
i mean how do u mess up a pizza .
i 'm not even kidding .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
people , the pizza here is just plain bad .
you 've been warned .
an hour ago , i ordered online for pick-up .
it would have been nice for customers and workers to have some ac going .
but like the garlic knots , the dough itself offered very little flavor .
overall , it was n't bad for the price .
it was n't bad but it was n't good .
the total bill when i got my pizza was $ _num_ !
friggin idiots .
seriously , i 've had crackers with more flavor .
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
the toppings all appeared to be right , but the smell was off .
i really should give this place a zero .
other than that i have tried this pizza sober and it is disgusting .
never go here , it 's bad .
do not get chicken as a pizza topping , its breaded chicken .
pizza dough was gross , soggy , not done well .
the sauce was super watery and tasted bad as well .
i think i had the worst pizza i 've ever had in my life .
gus 's is disgusting .
not good pizza .
there are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better .
want some pizza for lunch ?
want to have some dine in pizza ?
_num_ stars for being there when no one else is .
a cesar salad , and an order of hot wings last night .
$ _num_ pie with fees and tax was $ _num_ .
and it tasted like garbage .
ummm yeah dude why would i order them .
i called gus to inform them , a manager was put on the phone .
then she says they dont do refunds .
there service sucks .
the crust had much to be desired for a few reasons .
the more important crust disappointment was that it was very hard .
probably the worst pizza i have ever had .
which made it tolerable .
first time trying this place , never again will i give then my business .
the wings are small and not worth the money .
i wish i would have read these reviews before ordering !
everything went wrong !
i would not recommend this place for anyone .
bad management , and bad pizzas !
avoid at all costs unless you want diarrhea soup for dessert .
would n't recommend at all .
the gal said no to this request .
so i asked for the card to be refunded .
thanks but no thanks gus ' .
place the order at _num_ , got it at _num_ .
unacceptable .
delivery driver came without red peppers or parmesan cheese .
totally unacceptable .
pizza is okay , not great but not bad either .
anyway , i delivered pizzas for a couple of years a long time ago .
terrible customer service and mediocre pizza .
what the hell ?
tell your staff to slow the heck down when answering a call .
how the hell can a pizza that long at _num_ in the morning ?
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
that 's not the worst part though .
cold !
also , the garlic knots were raw in the middle .
not just some , all of them .
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
i would skip this place .
try a different restaurant instead .
absolutely the worst pizza i 've ever had .
it 's cool how they are _num_ hours !
these folks must have been referring to gus 's .
the call was placed for delivery ... a large pizza and _num_ dozen wings .
with regard to the pizza , this was just not worth the first bite .
thin and chewy should not go together for pizza crust .
the wings ... so sad .
i 've had this a few times since .
delivery takes forever , customer service is god awful .
seriously , these people are such assholes .
you get what you pay for , and this place is still a ripoff .
should never be more than a star .
if you want stale crust , eat at gus 's .
is that why the pizza took so long ? )
straight up theft and credit card fraud is n't cool .
this place is not the same !
it 's intrusive and extremely annoying .
the pizza was by far the worst i 've had .
if you want new york pizza do n't bother coming here !
worse customer service ever !
everyone was just rude and the pizza was absolutely terrible .
it was slimy because of the grease and the dough was undercooked .
seriously , do n't waste your money .
unfortunately the pizza was not edible .
but this was my first delivery experience with horribly burnt pizza .
no call .
i would rather eat _num_ $ tony 's pizza from food city .
cons : pizza did not taste good .
i would n't recommend it .
_num_ - delivery took forever .
_num_ miles away $ _num_ out of area fee .
that 's ridiculous .
seriously , that 's how bad their customer service is .
im in love with wings , just need to get my fix .
i hope its a bad night for them a few weeks ago .
not to mention i live less than a mile away .
super disappointed , tired , and hungry .
however , my first experience with gus ' was quite negative .
the pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour .
an hour later , no pizza , so i called .
no record of an order placed , yet paid for .
yelp says the location has closed .
apparently that 's wrong .
false advertising !
_num_ stars across the boards .
tip him hard if that 's your dude !
you are better off going to get a frozen pizza .
do n't waste your time or money !
never washed his hands !
honestly , this was way below average .
just really bad pizza .
if you guys can fix that , then you would be grade a .
needless to say it wasnt worth $ _num_ and i was pissed .
the only good thing i can say was the service was fast .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
ok so the service is fine here but everything else was terrible .
the meat had no taste the salsa was blah .
i was spending _num_ a month getting my cars repaired and painted here .
i hate to give anyone a _num_ star review but you guys deserve it .
returned _num_ weeks later , the truck was there for _num_ days .
talked to another family in the parking lot .
they were having the same problems .
this place was average , nothing great.
tried this place for the first time .
i think that there are way better viet places not very far away .
_num_ 1/2 rounded up to _num_ .
i chose this place because of rating on yelp .
but really , _num_ stars ?
i do n't get it .
skip it unless you 're wanting to say you had pho .
for me , the pho was nasty .
remember eating here a couple years ago and the pho was really bland .
the springs rolls were good but a little bland .
the peanut sauce tasted like it should , so that was good !
my husband ordered the spicy garlic chicken with rice .
i ended up dipping my veggies in my husbands garlic sauce .
- let me just get this out of the way .
probably could 've gotten a free meal out of it , but oh well .
getting a refill was not easy .
would you like some cockroach with your soup ?
the service was really poor .
its the worst i have had here on the east side .
that ca n't be right , or sanitary .
wish i had n't .
it just did n't feel clean .
i felt sick after i ate there and i am definitely not going back .
the entire meal was mediocre at best !
i just had a horrible experience there .
he then takes me menu right off my hands .
and then a cockroach walked across my table !
ok , i wo n't make a big deal .
he just sat them down .
pho was so bland and disappointing .
the bowl was small for $ _num_ .
upset with the roach more than the horrible service and food .
worst fried rice i 've ever had !
it was so bland !
i also shortly after had a horrible stomach ache that lasted several hours .
i went into the meal expecting big things but i was sadly disappointed .
i will not come back here ever again .
beware , you have been warned .
went here at 8:30 so about _num_ minutes before they closed .
the pho came out a little hotter than room temperature .
there was barely any meat in the pho .
the rice was exactly room temperature .
inedible cardboard food .
i hate this place .
seriously hate this place .
the food here sucks .
the staff is hit and miss , sometimes friendly sometimes not .
i went to the biltmore and alas that location was gone .
the coffee really is n't worth it .
- bad customer service .
- messy .
needs some serious training on how to make coffee .
yuck , yuck , yuck .
then i made the mistake of drinking the latte .
it was awful and tasted burnt .
ugh .
i am all for supporting local businesses , but they need to deserve it .
i went there today , and now even that 's dead .
it 's no wonder the place is usually abandoned .
but i do n't see much hope for their future .
the alternative copy shop is just that , an alternative .
they take forever to deliver and when they do , its all wrong .
i will not take anything there ever again .
i walked in to print something from a thumb drive .
he said yes , but would need another _num_ business days to complete .
$ 15-20 quote that becomes $ _num_ actual price ?
thanks but no thanks .
worst customer service ever .
however , i just had to drop a class because of their slow service .
worthless .
complete rip off in every way .
thieves , nothing but thieves !
woman at the counter : `` that 'll be $ _num_ per cut . ''
i said no thanks .
`` oh , wait ... you can use the paper cutter upstairs . ''
no paper cutter to be found .
wo n't be coming back .
that was _num_ weeks ago .
never called me back .
your eggs are too expensive and are not worth _num_ a piece , ridiculous .
it 's not a burger destination .
the bun was ok , and it came with pickle , onion and lettuce .
there was no `` wow moment . ''
`` no prob .
`` , i thought , she just forgot to take it off .
so , we went on the busiest day of the week , sunday .
and , sadly , we were n't impressed .
( no , i do not feel bad about that . )
big disappointment .
the green chili was very unremarkable .
coffee is weak .
if you go - maybe stick with the eggs max with chorizo .
unfortunately , it did n't live up to the hype .
the eggs were cooked well , but the chorizo tasted off .
i do n't see the big deal .
not great , but not terrible .
i would never go back for more of that though .
also not good .
my first bite was cold .
the flavor is somehow bold and bland at the same time .
i ate about 1/4 of the plate and could n't do it anymore .
i left the place unsatisfied and kinda hungry .
i will never go back there because the food is so bad .
i have been here twice and both times have been very mediocre at best .
i get the draw of this place though .
just was n't impressed .
it seemed like everything was just cooked too hot .
another $ _num_ .
the food is bland and over priced .
tempe sure do n't know food !
i give it _num_ greasy spoons .
not anything great like other reviews claim .
but then again tempe is a strange place .
this is just a typical greasy spoon hole .
i have had better greasy spoons , much much better .
they wo n't split the check .
i have been here before and have been satisfied .
the waitstaff does their job , but they are n't overly friendly .
the food is average to less than average quality .
plus , it was kinda pricey for _num_ people .
although i used to enjoy coming here the past _num_ times have been terrible .
but , im taking away a star for cleanliness .
the place has really gone down in cleanliness .
and they have an awful odor coming out of their kitchen .
sadly i wont be returning .
the food was mediocre at best .
someone obviously did not use enough grounds .
the only saving grace was that she did n't charge us for the coffee .
overall a pretty mediocre experience .
first impressions are everything and mine was weak .
meh , it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner .
when we walked in no one greeted us they just looked at us .
finally a lady grabbed a couple menus and just walked away without saying anything .
we followed , assuming she was seating us .
it was extremely rude and awkward .
we sat down , and gave our drink order to the asking server .
that 's ridiculous !
$ _num_ for a couple pieces of french toast !
gross food .
my dad got an egg combo plate ... same low quality food .
are these people dumb ?
it is a hole in the wall kind of place .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
i do not understand how this place is still in business .
and to think i went twice in hopes it was just a bad day !
just a bad place !
for my bacon , all i tasted was salt !
but i would not come here again .
first of all , the coffee was really below standard for a breakfast place .
the food was n't much better .
everything seemed to need a lot of salt cause it lacked flavor .
the bill was $ _num_ for two , with a tip .
too bad , had high hopes .
_num_ seconds later she wanted to know our order .
were we irritating her or something ?
zero personality .
did n't ask how things were ... just gave change .
not like we 'll be missed .
i went here for breakfast with my mom and daughter .
i got french toast with sausage and eggs .
the toast was a little soggy and bland .
she did not like the french dip at all .
the meat was very , very dry and had no seasoning .
unfortunately , the meat did not taste fresh either and really grossed me out .
next to the french dip , these were the worst .
ordered the links over easy with rye toast and hash browns .
when i got my breakfast , yup , you guessed it .
i said , these are home fries .
i do n't like home fries whatsoever .
some of the home fries are okay , but not theirs .
no onions peppers or anything .
just very dry cut up potatoes .
to top it off , my over easy eggs were over hard .
i 'm sure she really cared anyway .
save your money , go elsewhere .
it 's not printed on the menu !
no complaints there .
however the server forgot my husband 's bacon .
i 'm expecting some awesome food , but their food is so bland .
the `` hash brown potatoes '' are not hash browns by any means .
very disappointed .
i 'm still eating and i needed that napkin !
also we had n't even gotten our check yet !
overall we were very disappointed and probably wo n't be coming back .
service today was terrible .
the server was taking another ladies order when i sat down .
i work in the service industry and it was just sad .
needless to say , i left .
just disappointing .
i do n't trust yelp , really losing faith in the reviews .
unfortunately our visit today will be our last .
no server , no explanation , no attempt to remedy the situation .
it 's not my business .
the attitude is very bad .
the station 's understanding of new jazz is far off .
so many people were crammed into this relatively small space .
never in my life have i seen a line for a wave pool .
food is quite pricey ( no surprise here ) .
once we tasted the shakes we wanted to return them they were so bad .
they hardly mix the ice cream and its run by a bunch of kids .
if you have a new born this is not the place to be .
disneyland or the airlines wo n't charge the first year of life .
very disappointing first experience !
they refused to give a refund and tried to give us another round .
a couple in particular were super nice , hence _num_ stars and not _num_ .
quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house .
really tough course and i wondered where all of the decorations were .
however , customer service was not so good .
the receptionist was not friendly or helpful .
took me _num_ minutes just to pay to get into the place .
one would assume that my season passes would cover the promotion .
that clearly did not help at all .
we 've been here to play miniature golf multiple times .
over $ _num_ for _num_ holes is ridiculous .
we played _num_ holes and quit out of frustration .
it is sad because this place used to be great .
they are very busy , but slow , and relatively indifferent to their customers .
two stars for being open _num_ hours , just not worth the wait though .
i despise going to this walgreens .
all in all though a ridiculous waste of my time .
an hour later i received a text stating it was ready for pick up .
you could tell he was over worked and they were obviously understaffed .
after ringing me up he explained how to use the medications .
walgreens , my advice to you is to learn how to staff correctly .
they refused and demanded my doctor call them instead .
the store side is good but the pharmacy is the worst .
poor attitudes and customer service from the techs .
not worth the frustration .
tried to get a rx filled at this location .
they did not know how to process it .
i asked why did not bill it to the coupon provided .
again got the stupid look .
slow , surly , shoddy & expensive .
but it 's shoddy that runs through .
so i 'm done .
the worst cleaner around .
poor service , quality and price .
do yourself a favor and find another dry cleaning service .
this place is not worth the overpriced dollar they charge .
the service at this place is horrible .
this was it , i was never going back .
no refund given , no call returned from management .
very bad business !
brought in laundry on a friday , told it would be ready monday .
the other person waiting in line turned around and left at this point .
this place is too `` trendy '' .
eh , is really all i have to say .
- poor customer service .
well their selection is n't too bad ... .
next to trails , this place charges too much for their hookah merchandise .
i know their rent may be high , but their prices are like stupid .
rip off !
ok this place is horrible .
it sucks to be ripped off .
never again will i buy anything at this store .
burned through a lot of `` plant material '' without much of an effect .
i fell for an upsell .
_num_ bucks for a t shirt ?
we will not be back .
why the _num_ star review ?
we will not be back .
i got the baked pesto ziti with chicken .
it was all right , nothing to write home about .
_num_ minutes for _num_ slice of the most common pizza ever served ?
the mixed drinks are horrible !
i hated it .
i think the smell was bothering me and ruining my appetite .
that 's too much .
oregano 's is nothing special .
i 've been twice and both times i was unimpressed .
could n't tell you his name because he never introduced himself .
i am so sad .
he ordered half meatballs and mushrooms , i ordered half cajun chicken and pineapple .
it also tasted like cardboard , the finest cardboard in tempe .
last week i celebrated another one my birthday with _num_ of my friends .
as we were being seated the other _num_ people showed up .
disappointing .
my review is based on just a couple of chicago style stuffed pizzas .
we could hardly have one slice each .
too bad .
now i remember why i do n't come here .
i just think there is better out there .
we had salad , pizza , wine , beer .
about _num_ minutes passes , no beer , by then my wine was gone .
slow service for larger parties .
we were n't able to eat together .
only like _num_ tables inside .
to sum things up , service was poor and disappointing !
this place does not have a reputation of a pizzeria bianco .
we sat down at _num_ , ordered by _num_ .
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
and our order should have went in at _num_ .
i do n't complain unless it 's reasonable enough to complain .
she just did n't handle it properly the first time around .
no one really ate their food .
so , we went elsewhere .
not worth the service wait .
all for only $ _num_ .
i feel like a cheated rabbit .
wo n't be going back .
the noodles are literally mush .
this dish the noodles are literally almost a soup .
_num_ mush bowls and you do n't comp or do something better .
_num_ of us are .
_num_ minutes after they seat those _num_ people , _num_ more people join them .
so clearly you lie to get seating here .
i take a bite and immediately notice something hard .
comp my meal ?
hell .
about _num_ minutes later we were seated .
the experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words , sucked .
we sat down and ordered cheesy garlic bread to start .
the sauce was watery and flavorless .
very disappointed , heard good things .
such a shame .
walked in and sat at the bar on a mellow sunday afternoon .
walked by _num_ employees on the way in and no one said hi .
the cashier then apologized on my way out the door .
( sorry to late ) _num_ years ago this place was great .
not anymore .
great food but truly mediocre service .
totally ridiculous .
so lame !
stupid policy !
it 's not like they are busy today .
but it 's not !
unfortunately it 's where the birthday girl wants to eat .
f this place !
i also came into the restaurant _num_ minutes before close .
tonight i came into join some friends for a meal .
it took them _num_ minutes to get a beer at the bar .
i 'm sorry , what ?
it 's a monday and it 's not packed at all .
if i had known , i would n't have ordered food .
another server came back with my beer and it was a blue moon .
my friend had ordered two more beers , and the bartender dropped them off .
it was a little awkward to say the least .
no smiles , no nothing .
bad service , bad food ... bad everything !
food was brought to the table cold from fridge twice seriously ?
it started out good .
but that was my fault .
it was annoying .
just ordered a cheese pizza , extra cheese .
cold , bland , terrible pizza .
very disappointing .
will not be back and i recommend no one else go there .
i did n't have a good experience at oreganos .
i payed over $ _num_ for my meal and felt totally ripped off .
maybe people just do n't know better .
wo n't be returning .
it was the only one you did n't use on your menu .
the chicken parm was okay .
do n't settle for this bs .
( ( thoughts - from who the dd ice fairly ?
repeat conversation above .
will not be going back .
the people working here were rude and unhappy .
the cashier lacked any personality and it was like talking to a zombie .
i asked for coffee with sugar ... it 's not that difficult .
_num_ stars because the coffee and doughnuts were still yummy .
the donuts here do n't taste all that fresh , at least to me .
as for the coffee , it tastes somewhat watered down in my opinion .
it 's not all that strong and does n't have much flavor .
what if i change my mind ? ''
horrible service !
so i tried again to just get one donut at around 10am .
there were three employees and two just standing at the drink station .
i stood at the register just wanting to get one donut .
so she just kept standing at the drink station .
so sad .
they look miserable behind the counter instead of happy to accomodate their customers .
the store is disorganized and confusing and as i mentioned above , too small .
warning : horrible service do not come here !
this location does n't even deserve one star !
extremely unnecessary !
do n't waste your time .
both times , i left without purchasing .
i wo n't be back .
most awful service ever .
disgusting .
avoid .
sometimes they act like they want to be there , sometimes they do n't .
this one is close to my house but it is n't my favorite location .
_num_ workers who had zero sense of urgency .
assuming it 's the latter , i ask if everything is good now .
i 'm not exactly sure who is expected to buy a back issue here ?
i guess thats where the workers get their attitude from .
and i was assured there within walking distance .
the hotel i could not locate one .
it 's dirty and run down .
was not a good example of the country inn and suite standard .
we probably get pizza from here once or twice a month .
their customer service stinks !
they sold me an absolute lemon .
they got it on just before sunset and i drove back .
more importantly , very hard for me to believe they did n't know !
it has never operated right , and parts continue to fall off .
i am dropping another $ _num_ to repair it this week .
very frustrating ... .
i do n't want to spend too much time on this restaurant .
i 've already wasted time eating there .
too salty !
too dry and too salty .
this is not an indian restaurant by any means .
however the ceiling tiles were as described - in need of urgent repair .
it did not come sizzling and the onions on the side were cold .
not just room temperature , but refrigerator cold .
oh and it was really hard to find .
which i had no problem with .
what the hell ?
my blood may be rare , but so is my patience .
staff is very unprofessional .
the lack of professionalism definitely gets annoying .
_num_ pay rates are fair .
but they can trick you with the pay scheduling .
wrong .
that 's not the norm though .
the service here is not the best .
even their bar food misses the mark .
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
it started off bad .
we are only _num_ years old .
she appeared to just ignore me and did even care .
yes , it is complimentary , but that is not really the point .
at $ _num_ , they should throw in breakfast .
the room is ok , just ok , not offensive , nothing special .
used the bar , got a complimentary drink , completely lacking atmosphere .
the first night i was there i had _num_ green flies in my room .
it was not a good first impression !
also , walls are paper thin !
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
the biggest thing that i hate about the hotel is the valet service .
even when i asked they would not do it .
let 's be real guys - the room was $ _num_ a night .
third - it was loud at night .
valet broke my window .
if you want to sleep it 's a problem .
if you are _num_ years old though , this place would be awesome .
i would be very cautious to stay here .
i would book your stay elsewhere .
nothing special .
then i had to wait in line _num_ minutes again just to pay .
incompetent thieves !
the second time around , some of the colors were off .
i would give this place zero stars if i can .
she is a college student , and this was a shock for her .
$ _num_ for two copies .
my two star goes to the terribly unhappy woman that works behind the counter .
and this locations lack of attention to detail .
why do you have to be so pissed off looking ?
it makes your customers uncomfortable .
consider yourself warned .
about _num_ % of the time , my directions were n't followed .
also , i feel that service has almost always been extremely slow .
this was the worst customer service ever !
ac went out in _num_ degree heat .
they said it would be _num_ hours until they could come out .
they waited _num_ hours and _num_ minutes to call us and tell us .
do n't waste your time asking them to come help .
worst customer service i 've even encountered !
the food here is only mediocre in my opinion .
bad treatment , the owner is very rude and the staff are not friendly .
i do not recomend this store to any one .
bad food and funny tasting tap brews .
good : cheap drinks !
one of our friends was told he had a fake id and is _num_ .
horrible .
it was pretty dead inside , which we were ok with .
very little chips and salsa on the side .
to find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare .
badly .
so yeah , food totally sucked .
what sucks worse then having terrible food when this hungry ?
ugh .
i do n't deal well with bad service like that !
that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway .
the bar itself is n't very appealing .
he replied that regardless , i parked walked inside and then walked out .
needless to say my friends and i took our money elsewhere for the evening .
zero stars if possible .
i under that on dollar wednesdays it can get kind of hectic thats fine .
then he walked away .
so this review is for you , your service is horrible .
the apartment is small and plain .
i have made complaints to the leasing office that went unheard .
i 'm sure they heard me tonight .
do not rent here .
at this point , i 'll break the lease to get out of here .
i repeat do not rent here .
so far , i 've lived here six months , no big problems really .
first off , the apartments itself .
the neighbors , they 're not the greatest , to be modest .
i walk my dogs the same route every day .
why do n't i move ?
this place is not worth it , do not live here .
last but not least the management is horrible .
this place provides a roof over your head -- nothing more .
there was also dead roaches and bugs under the stove !
the management does n't care about your living situations and are so disrespectful .
temperature is falling down , their heaters are not working .
wo n't recommend to anyone .
free if i wanted to drive back an get it .
wanted about _num_ min for the owner before i left .
this place has zero customer service .
i 'd give this a zero if i could .
what is supposed an exciting and fun time has become an utter nightmare .
poor customer service , decent at best smoothies .
the smoothies are great , but the customer service is awful .
i will not be coming to this location any longer !
it 's not their prices , and it 's definitely not their service .
her tone was incredibly rude .
which is $ _num_ each .
_num_ for $ _num_ !
everything in their store is 2-3 times regular price or online .
complete idiot .
plus his pricing was ridiculous .
also , i am a navy veteran .
i could have walked there and back in that time .
it 's the most mediocre pizza i 've had in a while .
i just do n't think it deserves more than _num_ stars .
when i got home the food was awful .
the spaghetti and meatballs looked something out of a can .
the wings tasted like crap .
i would not recommend eating here unless they change management .
this is only good pizza to people who have never had good pizza .
the toppings seem ordinary at best .
the veggie was better tasting than the pepperoni and i 'm not a vegetarian .
make jokes after you give me everything i 'm there for .
the food was cold and i found two hairs in the wings .
at this point , would suggest spinato 's or even mellow mushroom first .
then getting a refund is another problem .
gross !
i ate _num_ slice and threw the rest out .
do n't waste your money !
even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .
it sucked ass .
except no one wanted it .
so , it went in the trash .
i ordered the meat ravioli and spaghetti with meatballs .
truly , how does someone screw up pasta ?
pathetic .
however , there would not be any manager on shift until tomorrow afternoon .
however , there would not be any manager on shift until tomorrow afternoon .
and in less than _num_ seconds walked back across the street and into ihop .
we walked out , could n't find his car and did n't panic .
i still ca n't believed this happened .
so far , we have been unable to resolve this in a reasonable way .
it kills me how businesses here treat students .
i have eaten there so many times that i can not even count them .
all due to proximity and availability , never due to desire .
this is the only restaurant i have watched someone get sick in .
it is busy all night .
only two tables are seated .
the next day , we tried the ihop on apache again .
waited again for a while , no one came to seat us .
wo n't be returning .
horrible service took well over an hour to get our food .
i guess the more convenient , the worst everything else gets .
usually short staff and food takes forever to cook .
go elsewhere for better service .
it was your typical ihop food .
it just looks a little run down .
it just was n't anything i was super amazed about .
the food was heavy , americanized `` mexican '' food .
the prices were very high for such low quality .
upon entering , the first thing i noticed was no air conditioning .
its _num_ outside and no ac ?
the chips were stale .
then i ordered a burrito , which came with rice and beans .
the burrito was ok , as were the rice and beans .
my iced tea was never refilled .
not sure i would have wanted any more though .
the iced tea just was n't very good .
very annoying .
beans and rice tasted bland like from a can .
the burrito itself was okay nothing great .
service was horrible , the server was not friendly or attentive .
we actually had to get up and poke our head in the kitchen .
rates are in the sky and management not great at all .
you even stated that no matching shorts were required .
there 's always a pipe bursting somewhere so the waters constantly off .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
, i repeat ... do not move in here !
two scorpions during our stay ( the little bark ones , yikes ! )
the worst management ever , especially the boss lady .
but i ca n't do that every issue can i ?
the foods gotten really bad too .
this place is pretty trashy , i 'd rather smoke my hookah at home .
the second sandwich was a grilled chicken dish wrapped in a pita .
i did n't get to eat it because my friend ate it all !
i am so not lying !
and finally ( one time _num_ minutes later ) we get our food .
unfortunately i ended up leaving very unsatisfied in the job done .
he did not do the heart , only the three lines around it .
we basically told him to screw off then walked home .
so i receive little from going there and supporting this horrible place .
i swear , this place will charge a cover if the radio is on .
this place is downright awful .
it would n't cost that much .
the bartenders were extremely rude and unfriendly .
i would recommend going to almost any other bar in tempe .
the disappointment came from the quality of food .
it did not taste fresh .
i would not come back if i could avoid it .
this just is n't that .
the ethiopian place three doors down does n't serve alcohol .
this was more just pouring red pepper in my mouth .
the chicken was dry to the mouth .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
until i tried other indian places , that is .
it 's not terrible .
anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds .
i received bland , room temperature food with undercooked meats .
a little kindness goes a long way , boys .
this review is for the _num_ star lunch buffet and the _num_ star service .
but , i could n't even keep this promise to myself .
very very red , as if cooked with tomato paste .
indian spices were not strong enough ; just chicken in a red sauce .
the tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce .
got introduced to indian food here back in _num_ .
the buffet is now one of the worst indian buffets in town .
very bad service .
the service guys and manager have no sense of manners .
when serving water , they have no manners .
this is the worst hotel i have seen here which has this bad service .
food is not that great .
i had a bad experience with the service of the place .
in addition , the hotel staff was also not polite while talking .
even if we ordered starters first everything is served at the same time .
the person who took the order was not interested nor patient .
the service of this place is very poor .
but no , the owner does n't care about it .
everything was terrible .
no salt or indian flavor in anything .
everything else in the buffet was cold .
i ordered takeout tikka masala and it was horrible .
mushy , short grain rice and dry chicken .
i 've never payed so much for an entree at an indian restaurant .
terrible food and awful service .
also in a very bad area .
i had an awful experience and i would n't recommend you go here .
a pathetic dining experience .
the food was bland ordinary , felt stale and uninspired .
came out disappointed and angry .
needless to say i 'm never coming back here !
i 'm a math major and did all the math ... no discount .
we were charged $ _num_ !
unbelievable .
they serve stale food and the service is terrible .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
but they suck when it comes to order pick up .
i ordered a tandoori meal combo and was stupid enough to not check it .
there was only meat and bread .
horrible customer service and i paid _num_ dollars for just some meat .
avoid !
extremely rude employees and average food .
for _num_ entrees , _num_ rice and _num_ orders of plain naan .
i 'm really disappointed .
would n't be a big deal except the rice is _num_ $ each .
if there were negative _num_ stars i would have given them those .
i got really pissed of him .
so the main thing -- pathetic service .
avoid this place .
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
however , we were very disappointed .
will not be coming back here anymore .
the worst indian food in the area .
first , we waited over _num_ min for pickup .
even though we each got paneer masala our meals could not have been different .
it tasted like canned tomato soup .
so disappointed and will never come back .
this is the worst restaurant i have visited so far .
poor customer service .
ridiculous place .
rude and arrogant waiter .
does n't matter how the food is .
service is so horrible .
will not be going here again .
disappointed with this place .
expectations for urgent cares are low and this one represents well .
the lady at the desk probably does n't care to work there much .
for what i needed done , it was the bare minimum .
the wait time was dumb .
i left there in a bad mood .
do n't let few people in the waiting room fool you .
i would love to put zero stars .
now she did n't know what paperwork she needed .
she has since been replaced with another receptionist .
i asked this receptionist why i have been waiting for over an hour .
should you have a similar experience contact your hr department or safety coordinator .
they always find a way to screw up our paperwork .
i do n't get it .
none of my three children really liked it .
just not good but i 've had worse .
the bun was mashed down and you could see finger prints .
i almost drove away when i saw how dirty they were .
but this is by far the worst one i have ever been to .
it took me _num_ min in the drive thru to get one sandwich combo .
absolutely absurd !
too disgusted to continue to try and eat the burger i threw it away .
overall not worth at all just gon na go to taco bell next time .
worst experience at a whataburger ever .
i noticed that the _num_ piece was _num_ .
he says okay your total is _num_ .
he made absolutely no sense .
but then , we get home & i start eating my food .
second and third were terrible !
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
payed _num_ more dollars for shitty food .
not a fan of this place .
again , she recommended i send it back .
i called the other local dealer _num_ miles away who were far more helpful .
the woman who answered the phone was really awful .
so , i tried again explaining about the orange and it stopping .
anyway , then she saw my credit card which was a southwest credit card .
it was n't necessarily the content of what she said , but her manner .
anyway , the bill was higher than i expected but that was fine .
i appreciate customer service , and this place lacks it tremendously .
backed up 2-3 groups on each hole with a $ _num_ price tag .
extremely disappointed by the round we played at this course .
i 've never seen anything like it .
we played _num_ holes in a little over _num_ hours .
half of our group left after the first _num_ .
there is too much of a stuffy corporate feel here to have any fun .
super inconsistent ratings , best approach is just try stuff .
the staff was rude and unwelcoming .
only stayed for an hour because of the heat in the building .
its ironic that the most convenient gym in phoenix is the worst .
the staff is incredibly high maintenance and obnoxious .
but the staff at this gym were extremely rude and impatient !
although i like the gym itself , i will never go back .
no anything ?
it 's only good business .
maybe this is explained somewhere on the site , but not clearly .
i did n't see it .
the dead walk amongst us .
then i did my first driving outing with them from _num_ to 9:30 pm .
which in some cases is good in others bad so i totally get it .
i can only give this company _num_ star based on their disappointing costumer service .
but as you might assume , it was a huge problem !
she says 3-4 weeks out to schedule .
now there was no way to get _num_ drives in before may 9th .
the restaurant is old and outdated inside .
the prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable .
the service was inattentive and lacking .
i wo n't go back .
they remained there for our entire meal , which was pretty disturbing .
i tried everything that was brought and did n't finish any of it .
i too experienced the crunchy rice .
i 'm a north indian and know the north indian food very well .
so in short , horrible location , horrible food , horrible ambience .
we bought the $ _num_ for $ _num_ take out groupon .
scam ) , they said they had no menu , what ?
$ _num_ for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan .
the biltmore does n't even charge these prices .
no proof but i would n't doubt this ) .
it is pathetic place .
all food was stale .
pathetic place , worst food .
decided never to visit this place again .
avoid this place if you care about your health .
that was $ _num_ per glass of iced tea .
the mango lassi was too sweet too .
big disappointment .
bland , tasteless food .
there was no spice or taste .
i give it _num_ star for many reasons .
the groupon was for _num_ , _num_ or _num_ people .
( that would have been $ _num_ per person for the dinner buffet . )
with the rain outside , it only made it worse .
the food seemed like leftovers from lunch .
all the dishes were with curry stains from lunch .
not cleaned up .
sadly , it was nothing good .
very basic & overall , tasteless .
i was like , what 's going on ?
that 's not what you said to me on the phone .
extra $ _num_ is nothing to write about at all .
no big deal .
if the food was exceptional , i would n't bother at all .
i cook better indian food at home .
maybe it cost you $ _num_ .
no one had a drink except me .
that all the food was bland ?
$ _num_ means nothing .
you do n't promise something & then do something else when we get there .
buffet had too many similar choices .
place was not very clean , nor inviting .
i was so wrong .
none of the curries taste like curry .
it all taste like chicken and gravy .
very bland .
her attitude was terrible .
they all tasted the same , with different things in them .
my husband and i were not impressed .
the food here was way too salty and bland .
my husband and i were not impressed .
the food here was way too salty and bland .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
worst of all , i got sick from his food .
please do not come here and make a better choice .
i would recommend india oven ( gilbert rd and southern ) .
plain awful food .
no spice or whatsoever .
the ambience of the place is bad .
water works for me !
there goes your tip people .
there 's plenty of indian restaurants in the area .
sorry , we wo n't be back to this one anymore .
you just lost _num_ good customers .
i was very disappointed at the cleanliness of this restaurant .
very very disappointing !
i went here once or twice , but there are so many better places .
ha !
over charging us for less than mediocre food , or ignoring us completely ?
my favorite dish had its own sign but nothing was there in its place .
zero ice anywhere !
all the meat was terrible and nothing was warm at all .
i will never go to the tempe improv again .
but who gives a crap ?
gee , guess i should be grateful .
after the show was over , our waitress came by with our bill .
i mean , i was really excited .
either way , it was really annoying .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
finally , the cue was given and everyone rushed through the doors .
the chairs were very close together and a foot behind me was another party .
strike _num_ .
ugh , i 've had better .
tempe improv is a joke ... literally .
when you arrive at the venue , you will not be picking your seat .
there 's nothing quite like $ _num_ cheesecake or $ _num_ nachos .
thankfully i do n't drink because the alcohol prices were even more ridiculous .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
not so !
i only wish there was a manager i could have spoken too .
for the bad , the food and drinks are extremely expensive .
as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .
it was n't funny at all .
what a rip-off !
the whole set up was ridiculous .
no one 's chairs were actually facing the stage .
worst margarita i 've ever tasted .
i really enjoyed the comedians and wanted to come back for more .
i have to say that i was really disappointed for a few reasons .
terrible service !
only reason they got _num_ star is because i cant go lower ... .
she did n't even look at me and said their are napkins right there .
it did n't make any sense but walked away without more explanation .
asked for honey mustard & bbq , received ranch .
it was thin and watered down tasting .
arrived with _num_ friends and picked up our tickets , no issues .
my white wine was served warm , gross .
to get a little laugh , this turned out to be a bad idea .
i would n't go back there again .
unfortunately , the new policies have made it that much harder .
the food quality is , overall , poor .
it was n't even warm and was tough to cut .
these were slightly better than the super pretzels you bake at home .
they were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else .
we all tried each other 's drinks and everything was weak and watered down .
there 's nothing more entertaining than a night out with friends laughing .
their mixed drinks are not even worth mentioning .
it was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a cosmo though .
my experience at the `` new '' tempe improv was definitely less than desirable .
like i said before , the comedy was the only good factor .
however , no one notified us .
any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly .
zero .
oops is not an acceptable answer .
customer service is not that hard .
i am actually really sad .
they have contacted me this week to try to remedy this .
tonight we received awful service from a server .
that is unacceptable service and we will not be coming back to this establishment .
tonight was my first night in the tempe improv in a very long time .
it is not set up to have everyone look at the stage .
just bland and awful .
that should be criminal .
their parking lot is garbage .
it is all ok , not great , but not terrible .
a bit ridiculous .
too bad their prices do n't reflect that intimate small club feel .
so disappointed .
so , about three minutes after i posted this , the phone rang .
it was clear that she knew that some guests had a problem .
she apologized and offered comps for any upcoming show .
not such a great experience at the improv last night .
first , parking is a nightmare .
it anyways has been there on weekends .
overlooked mahi and wet rice .
this was $ _num_ for two of us , but did include admission .
went to use the rest room -- it was out of paper towels .
not comfortable and kind of ridiculous given the number of people waiting .
they talked through the whole show .
one woman was trying to get on stage .
so , i get it .
there are obnoxious people ever where , but here 's the catch .
i could have stayed married and got that for free .
their drinks are so overpriced , even for a comedy club .
$ _num_ for an iced tea is absurd .
their specialty mixed drinks are $ _num_ and are in an approximately _num_ oz .
none of us will be returning .
the girls at will call seem very confused .
then she proceeded to make jokes that were completely lost on us .
i do n't understand why that 's such a big deal anyway .
the servers there deserve to be paid more .
this club needs to find a new staff to handle the tickets .
one of my least favorite comedy clubs for this reason .
once the laugh factory opens in scottsdale , i 'll take my business there .
and the bottled water was $ _num_ .
terrible drinks .
rude staff at the door .
everything else is terrible .
our server , lisa , was slow .
there 's no other way to say it .
just no .
i used to love the improv , i hated when it closed .
but i am not impressed with what it is becoming .
after the show we learned there was some sort of sewage problem going on .
last night i gave my first low tip in over five years .
it was $ _num_ on $ _num_ bill .
no lemon , no beer .
i 'm officially completely annoyed , and ask for the check .
to make matters worse , we were `` checked '' as we left early .
i explained that i left it with our server , who was terrible .
got hit with another $ _num_ bill .
what was the total cost for _num_ minutes of this entertainment ?
the drinks were incredibly weak .
out designated driver was charged $ _num_ for lemonade !
too bad , because otherwise it would be great .
i would 've preferred they just charged more for the tickets and be upfront .
i left just feeling ripped off , i will probably never return here again .
i think the remodel is great .
our minimum drink tab was more expensive than the ticket .
and trust , i was in need of a beer or _num_ .
ps they charge a _num_ % gratuity no matter what .
i am pregnant and did not feel like standing in a packed bar .
when we were finally let in to the building _num_ min late .
there were no drink prices listed anywhere .
overall i was disappointed in the service and overall experience .
i purchased tickets for the saturday night show on-line .
it was one of the worst customer service experiences of my life .
the venue was horrible !
had n't been to the location since the remodel .
the rows of tables they have would be great for groups of people .
you end of crammed against strangers and across from your date .
so not ideal for a date unless you can get into a booth .
alcoholic drinks are same price .
we did n't eat which i 'm glad we ate before we came .
the food look sub par , bar food , for higher end restaurant prices .
we will come back for the comedy but not for the food or drinks .
for ourselves , we ordered a bottle of wine ... .
fifty dollars for what ?
we went tonight because we got discounted tickets , _num_ for each .
so ... we were like okay , whatever .
little did we know , those _num_ drinks came up to fifty dollars .
_num_ drinks .
for _num_ dollars .
are you kidding me ?
they charged him $ _num_ for a crap bottle of wine .
something you could grab at the local gas station for _num_ .
seriously , i want my money back .
_num_ drink minimum , but do n't order a double .
they wo n't count it .
place is a complete ripoff .
dont waste you 're time .
not worth it !
this is a negative review warning people that they auto gratuity your check .
she tipped another $ _num_ .
the server never mentioned he added gratuity to the check .
audio on the 2nd floor was challenging at best .
the drinks themselves are n't cheap either .
then ... gratuity is included at _num_ % .
three of our party ended up ordering bottomless sodas to satisfy the minimum .
not even shitty domestic beer .
that 's nearly unacceptable in this day and age . )
it just speaks to how out of touch the improv is .
the experience just is n't enjoyable enough to warrant it .
it 's a shame , because it would n't be hard to fix .
not kidding .
the best word for this place is sleazy .
your way through people to find the exit to get out .
do not give them your email address !
i think that is beyond rude .
i would have left a decent tip any way because the service was fine .
over $ _num_ after some drinks and a double tip .
no thanks .
for four drinks , one meal and one appetizer , we paid _num_ !
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
the prices are not worth it .
do n't even have words for what went down at improv tonight .
really looking forward to that ugh !
$ _num_ for ice tea for _num_ person served in a clear solo cups .
and _num_ was all we were going to get .
then here came our $ _num_ bill of course tip is included .
i told our waiter he better go fill a few pitchers to go .
is a joke as the drinks are way overpriced .
just not a good atmosphere , mainly due to the seating and overpriced drinks .
wont be going back !
not just weak , nonexistent .
so two for me and _num_ for the person i was with .
watch your wallet here and trust no one who works there .
not even a buzz nor a discount , refund or apology .
totally ripped off for $ _num_ and one plate of food was inedible .
not even close .
way to go tempe improv as the joke was on us .
i am on the vip member list and sometimes get offered free tickets .
but the reviews are correct , the drink prices are ridiculous .
i probably wo n't be back to tempe improv unless i get free tickets .
i waited _num_ minutes and no one came out .
it 's reasons like this that comedy clubs get a bad wrap .
now it 's a major money drain .
she had no clue and said let me check .
was defensive and blamed me for complaining !
unfortunately for us they somehow managed to over book the valentines package .
we could have saved a whole lot of money and picked other seats .
aside from the talent the service is pretty bad .
so if your not paying attention your probably over tipping .
what really ruined it was the loud lady at our table .
i could n't imagine having to sit next to her .
these were not just small comments and loud laughter , it was much worse .
worst experience i have ever had in any type of show .
this is a very simple problem that can easily be fixed .
honestly , i do n't mind the extremely expensive drinks at all .
the balcony was being seated the same time as downstairs .
i could go again or i could skip it .
it was just okay for me , dog .
the cookies and brownies get _num_ stars on their own .
personally , i 'm not a fan .
this is a typical az hyped up joint .
the meats are not very high quality in flavor or texture .
i just do n't get why people think it 's sooo good .
this place sucks in comparison to most .
not my kind of place .
this place is over priced and the sandwiches are not that great .
went today to pick up a to-go order and was very disappointed .
neither salad came with a side of bread .
nothing about the italian sandwich is italian .
it was gross .
i 've never not finished an italian sandwich until today .
i hate to say it but i was so disappointed .
order large cream of broccoli soup in a bread bowl .
_num_ minutes later got an email that my order is ready .
i 'm never coming back again for lunch .
food was bland and way below average .
very slow and just not my type of place .
crap music .
no , it 's worse than that .
i 'd rather be stuffed in a trunk .
yes , it gets worse .
so , you try to tough it out .
but , let 's face it , life 's too short to be miserable .
this place was a sausage fest .
there was probably _num_ guys for every _num_ girl there last time i went .
never have i been so disrespected by an employee at an establishment .
she did n't offer to get more , she did n't apologize , whatever .
i 'm not even going to talk about the ambience .
can you make sure i get the tab ?
so , sadly , i give the library _num_ star .
i doubt i 'll go back .
it 's not my scene .
yeah , it 's important to note , not many women frequent this place .
in the past i 've never really had any problems with service .
worst experience ever at a restaurant/bar !
walked up mill and heard about this place , decided to try it out .
went in and the staff was less than courteous .
i guess only the employees can dress in skimpy attire .
next time , skip the library .
this was apparently news to the bartender , the waitress and the manager .
hey , you do it for the scottsdale bars - so leave me alone !
outside , it was cramped and stinky of smoke .
not particularly friendly or fast .
if out on mill , i 'll stick to rula bula .
lame , the place is crammed and stinks .
so why only _num_ stars ?
no women customers was interesting .
( yes , i really said that , i know ... ) .
i took a male coworker there and was almost embarrassed .
i 'm not sure i would have felt that way ... upstairs .
it is like an irish tgi fridays .
i thought the food was lousy .
i had the shepherd 's pie , and i sent it back .
so i called about 3pm to find out what time he goes on .
rula : i do n't even know .
me : can you get me someone who can find out ?
rula : no , there are no managers here .
much better then , `` this is steve '' .
she does n't say anything and just walks away .
but hey , it 's tempe .
but irish pub , you are kidding me .
do not come here if u actually drink anything other than beer .
pushing _num_ 's door down .
we were double billed and the service was horrible .
i tried two appetizers - both were not good and both overpriced .
my recommendation would be - do n't eat here .
the bartender from chicago was awful .
he was rude and did not deserve our service .
i had the grilled cheese and it was hard and dry !
i will not be going back !
this place is expensive , especially for what it is .
terrible food .
i mean , that 's saying something is n't it ?
note to self : beer only next time .
we had dinner here last night , the food leaves much to be desired .
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
not sure and i do n't care !
another couple were waiting and discussing how bad the service was as well .
an embarrassment to the irish bar name .
hate it .
horrible .
terrible drinks .
rude bartenders .
this was just an insult to watch .
horrible , horrible place ... ... rude management , lazy bartenders , stupid servers .
the food is just ok .
not to mention that the mixed drinks here are really expensive .
sorry , rula bula .
you went from being my favorite bar , to one of the worst .
the people that take your money at the front are downright rude .
the new management is terrible .
worst experience ever !
fail .
the food is too overpriced for what you get .
i mean really , how do you mess that up ?
they were n't strips at all but more like nuggets and way over cooked .
for $ _num_ , it was incredibly disappointing .
i think i 'll stick to drinks only from now on .
on wed nights they have trivia at _num_ .
i ordered an artichoke and spinach dip and guinness wings .
our waters were n't refilled either .
the main reason to go to rula bula would be for the atmosphere .
another bad case of poor door managers .
the bartenders used to be awesome and personable .
used to love this place .
i did n't have my wallet so i simply asked for water .
the waitress very rudely asked me to leave .
disappointed by this experience .
service is so bad .
terrible !
it was bland but overall a good burger .
of course , i have a problem with it .
for your money , go to the george and dragon .
we probably ordered our food about _num_ minutes after we had all been seated .
that was probably the worst service i had ever experienced .
guess i 'll just stick to casey moore 's .
atleast i can get a sandwich there much quicker .
not after today .
you do n't play irish music .
love it there but unfortunately last saturday was not a good experience .
however , once we got rolling she was fairly attentive .
my problem with this place is the bartenders .
they were almost certainly _num_ % soda water with a lime .
very disappointed .
they took our reservation -- no problem .
easier to dump the out of towners than honor their reservations .
the cover is $ _num_ .
the food was really bad , it was just thrown together .
and , served on a paper plate , with a plastic knife and fork .
he was not very welcoming at all .
and the guy was so rude .
but he was n't worth another minute of my life .
will not go back because of door man .
i asked the server if the potatoes were real .
wow , worse than powdered potatoes .
this is so sad .
sitting at rula bula for the last time .
would not recommend .
i dunno , there 's this weird vibe at the place .
but why is everything on their menu a mock of regular , meaty foods ?
not good vegetarian food !
price : way too expensive for what you get .
obviously whoever made the food does not eat it themselves .
and the balsamic was really sour .
in smaller amounts it would probably have tasted fine .
the apricot miso bowl was really sour again .
they were a little spicy but waaaay too garlicky .
no thanks .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
for $ _num_ it was a disappointment .
i also got the diablo red with mock chicken and brown rice .
overall , i 've made better vegan food at home .
everything we ate , we could get better elsewhere .
they were positively mushy inside , and had both hot and cold spots .
the last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff .
terrible !
everything was either fried or so salty i could not even eat it .
the pita chips were fried and so greasy !
very disappointed .
as usual , i went onto to yelp and looked at reviews .
they were pretty positive , so it was a go .
well first of all i think people are just not honest .
first of all , we walk in and it is chaos .
now do n't get me wrong i go vegetarian all the time at restaurants .
so gross .
needless to say , i will not be going back .
this is truly mediocre , yet totally veg , fare .
are n't these people vegan ?
then why so much fake meat ?
i will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have .
another negative is nearly everything is fried .
i 'll give them a _num_ star because what we chose was quite tasty .
if you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or ethiopian places .
i came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was very disappointed .
the food was awful .
ugh ... i 'm still feeling green from this meal !
atmosphere : i have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe .
she was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter .
sorry , dear .
( do n't worry , i will not be back . )
food : boyfriend and i hated the food we have gotten here .
he ate two bites and pushed it away .
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
not worth $ _num_ , but good .
please do not waste your money .
there are not enough tables for the amount of people .
do not leave for hours !
no ac in the `` restaurant '' during the summer .
unacceptable .
is n't that their job to serve in a timely manner ?
being late , being stupid , and being wrong ?
i wo n't be going back .
i tried a bite .
that 's the only reason the rating is so low .
why get rid of it ?
i 'm sad as i 'm going to miss this place .
just ca n't eat this stuff anymore .
it was almost as bad as tasting ocean water .
every bite was overwhelmingly unbearable .
oh , and the food gave my friend the terrible runs .
i ordered something that is n't on the on-line menu .
we both , reluctantly , grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler .
they were ok ... not bad ; nothing to write home about .
the samosas consumed , we sat , and sat some more .
it was , i have to say , really unpleasant .
i took a bite of the faux beef , and it was ok .
if you 're a vegetarian , you 'd do better to eat at lalibela .
unfortunately , we were highly disappointed !
and its awful .
next thing is adding salads ?
you hurt my feelings .
i honestly dont think i want to go back im so up set .
whats on the menu now is nothing compared to what it used to be .
customer service was terrible !
however , after eating here for some time i had to stop .
no texture , just a mushy mess .
um ... i am confused with all the great reviews .
i was really disappointed .
they still failed .
the service was also really bad .
do n't know why this place has so much hype .
in my opinion , they could and should do a better job .
horrible service .
there was absolutely no difference in the flavor between the _num_ bowls .
she just said `` sorry about that '' and walked off .
for $ _num_ a bowl , it was definitely a disappointing meal .
your coconut curry was so plain and flavorless !
i really should 've given the dish back .
it was hard to eat it was so bland .
this _num_ star is truly only for the coconut curry .
really , really disappointing .
i do n't like their buffalo wings .
i asked for it , but they still came out in this weird sauce .
the frys were good , but soggy as well .
it 's too expensive for the hype that it gets .
the parking is awful .
i wish they were open for sunday breakfast .
i could have gotten a salad and a sandwich for less than $ _num_ .
i wo n't go back .
very disappointed they ran out of average things in the menu .
no pork tacos and no chai tea .
this place has gone down hill in the past year .
disappointed in the direction they are going .
i wish i could give a good review but i really ca n't .
i went into this place and the food was ok but not very consistent .
i think they should get more friendly people and work on their consistency .
this place is so ridiculously overrated .
if it was literally half the price this would be a 3-4 star review .
_num_ stars .
unfortunately , i have to say , you 're all wrong .
the texture is all off .
the flavors were not balanced .
i 've tried four different entrees here , and all were terrible .
the fries were also mediocre .
all the real people i know seem to agree : it 's shit .
this is just bad food .
im not a vegetarian so take this review with a grain of salt .
this place is trying a bit too hard to be trendy .
do your research on soy before getting too excited .
nothing fancy nor exceptional ... .
however my coworkers ordered the ice cream and were very impressed .
my $ _num_ bucks would have gone much further elsewhere .
for my own experience , _num_ star ... .
here is an update to my previous praise of green restaurant .
consistency is terrible .
management is not there , absolutely no call backs .
the flavor was lacking and so was the sauce .
it was too garlicky as well .
i want subtle garlic as i would like to taste other flavors .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
it was a simple request and the customer service was completely horrible .
i will not be going back again .
will not be returning as the prices can not justify the service and quantity .
moreover , the salads are noticeably smaller with less fresh greens .
just got off the phone with these people - john the owner .
it tells me that i need to go elsewhere for better customer service .
very unprofessional , with little to no knowledge of what customer service is .
you ca n't estimate when a project will get done ?
you do n't apologize for your error ?
do n't be fooled by the name .
looked like it was out of business last time i drove by .
portions were a little small and the service was meh !
i would highly recommend against patronizing this establishment .
there were only about three or four tables with customers .
i approached an older man in street clothes who appeared to be an owner .
do n't you want my money to do good ?
assistance is not what i got .
the guy just gave me a short `` no . ''
i kinda wish i had , i might of gotten nicer service .
you can buy a brand new bike at walmart for $ _num_ .
lots of ( overpriced ) furniture .
there is a goodwill located just down the street ( south ) .
there was no sign and i was n't going to bother asking .
i could not believe how overpriced this store is .
they also have coupons from time to time .
if you just need a roof over your head i suppose this will do .
i arrived on friday shortly before 2pm and wanted to check in early .
you 've got _num_ other rooms , put me in one of those !
the service was n't great either .
okay , my room was n't ready yet , no big deal .
then told me that the room was n't ready yet .
not exactly the best nights sleep is guaranteed here either .
the guy at the front desk was cold and unfriendly .
after finally getting my room i could n't open the door .
it was disgusting .
the door would n't open at all .
then the refund did n't even go through until after we were already home .
not having that money made our trip back home very difficult .
i 've definitely seen better motel _num_ 's in my lifetime .
huge mistake .
not to mention the stains on the mattress and box spring - so gross .
i will never be staying at this location again .
we needed a room asap , so we could shower and get ready .
we need to get ready for a wedding .
her : i said after _num_ , so it 'll be at least _num_ .
very rude front desk clerk .
will not be coming back to this one .
i ended up getting _num_ hours of sleep and checking out of the place .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
( it was 1am , had no other choice but to stay . )
and now that leaves me writing this review .
and i 'll probably request a refund for this night as well .
but i mean it 's a motel _num_ .
after an hour , i was told that our room still was n't ready !
i think it goes without saying , we wo n't be staying there again .
the room i booked was n't available .
only had _num_ room with a double bed and the tv did n't work .
so embarrassed and disgusted .
the rooms were `` recently renovated '' which means absolutely nothing .
how is that non smoking motel _num_ !
worst place to stay and they have roaches .
not good at all .
i will not be staying here .
damn place is a joke and so is expedia !
i had to throw away all of my kitchen supplies and ive only started .
he doesnt seem to care what breaks in the place .
this is the worst place ive ever been to .
i would n't even recommend these apartments to my worst enemy !
it often does not pass .
it has regularly been closed down by maricopa county dept .
it took them three months to issue me a refund check .
you suck , real bad .
thank god i did n't eat a cheesesteak !
edit : used to come here often .
no more .
jay -- -- the manager , was here tonight and a total douche .
sir , jay ... you should not storm like a bull towards my table .
next time , ask me for my id .
the management here is not friendly unless they know you .
which makes the younger people , sub _num_ , feel uncomfortable and not appreciated .
unless your _num_ or older you should avoid this place .
only went as long as i did because it was walking distance .
she is the worst very rude .
you are horrible at your job and do n't know how to handle people .
horrible horrible , customer service .
food was ok nothing special .
got cut off after _num_ drinks , which was terrible .
i truly believe waitress was racist for us being brown .
everything about this place is disappointing !
beer was n't very cold .
food was typical bar food only worse .
will not be a go to place for me .
my food did n't take long .
it was n't bad , but it was n't really good either .
all in all , my cheesesteak was filling , but not very satisfying .
my lunch overall , was just so-so .
no more .
the waitress threw numerous amounts of napkins and utensils at me ... .
charging a cover on a random saturday night .
so , not worth anyone 's time for five dollar beers .
very disappointing experience , we probably will not return .
well this is not a place to order a cheesesteak .
first time i tried the cheesesteak it was garbage .
this company lost one of my items and promised to replace it .
weeks later and numerous phone calls later , they never did .
instead , they got angry at me for coming in !
this place has zero customer service .
they lost my clothes after i confirmed they had them .
the owner looked at me and told me there was nothing to do .
she is miserable ... do not go here !
these guys are horrible .
first _num_ _num_ times clothing was cleaned well .
then recently lost _num_ shirts and _num_ dress pants when dry cleaning .
the clothes that are finished this time were also horribly done .
he said it was n't his problem and he did n't have the time .
place needs some tlc .
the food is mediocre and pricey .
this is just nasty .
i bought my tickets through groupon for $ _num_ each .
it said it opens at _num_ .
then i checked the yelp reviews and yelp said they open at _num_ .
he told me it opens at _num_ .
he was actually very rude to me then drove away in his golf cart .
the general manager , bob , is in serious need of customer service training .
he does not care about the customer , customer satisfaction or his job .
it looked as though things were not cleaned up from the day before .
the bathrooms were just disgusting .
it was out of toilet paper but there was soap and paper towels .
each time i used the restroom i never once saw people wash their hands .
no one went to clean or check on them for the entire day .
the park looks like they need to do some major renovations .
but there is also a reason why i suppose .
i wo n't be back .
this weekend was terrible !
sure there were more people , but the staff was rude .
pick it up big surf , management _num_ % to blame today !
the park is not well managed .
about half of the slides require the use of an inner tube .
the park was extremely over crowded .
people pay good money only to have them stolen !
i would not recommend getting a season pass as there is virtually no benefit !
very sad to see whats happened to this place .
those poor life guards will throw the book at ya .
poor customer service , complete waste of money .
i would not return or recommend .
save your money and learn from my mistake !
the place was small and underwhelming .
not much there .
not good customer service , we will not be back .
very poorly managed .
so bizarre , so i politely asked him why ?
so bizarre .
big surf , more like big disappointment .
it 's not like there are very many slides to begin with .
notified management who had zero amount of empathy or concern for other guests .
visit one of the other _num_ water parks in the valley .
this place is the worst place we have ever been to .
the first aid people came over gave him a bag of ice and left .
i was so scared we rushed out the park and went to urgent care .
why would you post that your season stared _num_ days ago and then closed .
highly disappointed !
big surf , more like big mistake .
the park is older and a little run down .
slides are mediocre .
bathrooms were disgusting .
the worst part was the people that were there .
worst water park .
man was i wrong .
i would have rather stayed home and sat in the bathtub .
the place is very rundown , it needs some major paint and upgrades .
its also not a very clean park .
i am beyond disappointed .
i threw them away of course .
they want you to pay $ _num_ for a hamburger !
we just did n't even bother eating there .
there was no really exciting rides at all .
most slides were simple and boring .
its annoying .
i would not even pay $ _num_ to go here .
the bathrooms are a mess and they dont have changing stalls .
where is the lazy river ?
beyond disappointed i wasted _num_ hours here .
could n't stand it any longer .
very run down .
groupon does n't save you much .
warning !
do n't park in the south side of the main parking lot .
no apologies - nothing .
it was a bother for them to have to deal with me .
wrong .
the food was way over priced , and not that great .
maybe i 'm just used to ( spoiled by ? )
also , they put sesame seeds on their bread .
sesame seeds in an italian restaurant ?
bottom line , we wo n't be visiting here again .
the decor is a bit old school and the music is down right annoying .
the pasta was cooked correctly , but the sauce had a funky taste .
the meat in the meat sauce tasted burnt or extremely over cooked .
the sausage was served on a separate plate all alone .
eh , not a fan .
not terrible but nothing standout .
reminiscent of my chain steakhouse server days .
all in all a pretty mediocre experience .
first visit _num_ stars , second visit _num_ stars unfortunately .
i ordered a caesar with chicken .
a shame because the dressing was pretty good .
but again , drenched in vinaigrette .
also the meats and cheese were just thin slices , nothing of exceptional quality .
at $ _num_ , this was a miss .
the salads are ok , nothing special here .
my wife had the gnocchi this time , which was a bit tough .
but , alas , no such luck if the dining area is closed !
we got the spaghetti special for pretty cheap but it really was n't special .
but , we never did get to try that pizza !
so mediocre its not even funny .
small salad with salty bland dressing .
i could have put them together in _num_ large bite .
how the hell does a staple end up in an appetizer ?
what i ordered was very forgettable .
# _num_ ) so overpriced .
_num_ ) the food was mushy and tasteless , like bad nursing home food .
the food was n't even mediocre in quality .
my boyfriend and i dined in the bar so we could watch college football .
recently , i finally took my family out to eat at this place .
you know , the one that 's _num_ for $ _num_ ?
this just topped off a bad experience for us .
this place was an insult to italian cooking in general , let alone sicilian .
not a good experience tonight .
horrible food , horrible service !
we paid for our salads and drinks and left it was so bad .
on a saturday night at 7:00 pm , this place was out of manicotti .
when we were seated and we ordered , they brought out the bread .
the noodles were soggy , and my boyfriend said that his tasted reheated .
my waiter is the only reason im giving _num_ stars .
he tried his best but the food plain sucks .
do n't start by saying you have $ _num_ wine .
tomato sauce no seasoning awful .
bread not sliced .
the only thing home made here is the mess they made .
this place is by far the worst nail salon i have ever been to .
um , longest and most awkward pedicure of my life .
first off , the shop is the size of a shoe box .
an old dude did my pedicure .
i was denied the first time after my services were complete .
i went back _num_ times after that and was given different excuses each time .
she said `` yes , sorry . ''
no thanks .
one girl was working , and one girl was sitting doing nothing .
just say you 're appointment only , or hire more people .
plus , the place looked cheap and not that clean .
you can save your `` excuse '' reply on trying to justify your practices .
my full set is uneven and lumpy .
i did gave two starts because the people are very courteous .
found out i could get the same job done for just over $ _num_ .
my car was returned with the bumper plastic guard broke .
that is ridiculous , i want to warn people of their inflated prices .
they really could care less to have you as a customer .
their mission statement really should n't say ... .
their mission statement is not at all how they treat their customers !
so today i ended my membership and will not be going back !
i agreed to use the lower level instead .
i am extremely displeased and disappointed .
owner is rude .
if you want to be robbed go to gammage .
i got tickets which price used to be _num_ .
i signed the voucher for $ _num_ for _num_ tickets `` on sale '' .
however , i can be down to earth too .
i am so sorry mr. wright but your building needs an upgrade .
they also allow people in late , which is a big theater no no .
keep in mind , however , that avenue q comes with a traveling cast .
not impressed .
it 's a bit outdated .
of course , they do n't tell you this when you get your tickets .
i like gammage , but i feel like i wasted $ _num_ .
we can not afford to just buy one more ticket .
i do n't know many people who could now a days .
this just makes me so mad !
spending _num_ minutes in a line for the restrooms is completely unacceptable .
i was not impressed in the least with my seating .
the levels are usually off .
this theater is a disaster for acoustics .
i have seen many shows at gammage .
gammage itself however is not so amazing .
the restroom situation alone is enough for any woman to go crazy .
note to gammage - immediately do a renovation on the bathrooms !
worst audio ever .
it will be a long time before we consider going back to gammage .
the building itself is where the problem comes in !
further , the acoustics are terrible .
just guess the lines .
the venue is in bad need of a thorough renovation .
dirty carpet , dirty seats and generally disgusting dirty .
sad they ca n't update and spend money where it 's important .
my husband and i attended our first gammage event in april of _num_ .
we were in the second row and the audio was terrible .
big mistake .
the sound at each show was just as terrible .
i doubt handicapped people want to walk across an entire parking lot !
it took away from the show and that is unfortunate .
parking was easy , staff was great .
poor sound ... .
hard to understand actors .
i will never go here again .
sound system - the acoustics here are terrible !
there was no food offered on there menu .
no hummus etc for _num_ bucks .
the show dragged on .
the acoustics as always were terrible .
let 's talk inconsistent acting .
the more i go here , the more i hate this venue .
poor frank would probably be disappointed in the dirty orange carpeting too .
yet another horrible experience at gammage .
( i feel like i 'm listening to the charlie brown teacher perform . )
the venue itself is horribly run .
once you arrive , parking often takes _num_ minutes or more .
there simply are n't enough to support the audience .
how sad that $ _num_ million dollars was wasted !
little girls were crying , and their moms were desperate .
you go there , and it 's worse .
you come back and now that line is worse .
do n't fall for it , all of lines are long .
there is no wait for the men 's room , none .
left `` wicked '' less than a quarter into the show .
the sound quality was poor even though they supposedly upgraded the system .
asu gammage was horrible , even though the show ( wicked ) was amazing .
the theatre has not been added onto .
solutions that could be done in a week or less ?
teach your employees some compassion .
they should not charge so much for sub-par seats .
what i do have a problem with is the terrible sound .
however , gammage is a poor venue and badly needs updating .
the acoustics are poor .
the carpets are worn , etc .
other than that , it was ok .
is theater etiquette a thing of the past ?
it would be a shame not to .
yeah , but i ca n't say that .
uh , no .
the central air conditioning is terrible .
parking is an absolute nightmare .
the actual lot for the venue fills up over two hours before a show .
so i always show up _num_ minutes early .
and here 's the absolute worst -- there 's no bathrooms .
if i could give no stars i would .
the acoustics are beyond terrible despite putting in an expensive new system .
basically they did n't care .
terrible design .
drinks prices are average .
this place is the worst .
i went around ten on saturday night and it was packed .
however , the security is horrible and power hungry .
however , how does that concern me ?
they threw away my _num_ dollar beer and wouldnt let me in .
cue club is n't what it is all hyped up to be .
alright , i 'm being too harsh on this place .
there 's nothing that special about cue club , quite frankly .
no toilet paper .
waste of my time and drive .
next door bouncer informed me that they are closed .
never coming back they will ruin your night !
if not , lock your doors .
my friend looked at me to see what i was thinking .
that was highly disrespectful .
i do n't tolerate any level of disrespect from any establishment .
i do n't care what you 're serving up in there , no thanks .
i just got a take out from here , the beef kabob .
there is a reason i get take out , i ca n't cook .
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
it sure looked pretty but did n't taste like anything .
i had a kabob dish which was mediocre but definitely not worth the price .
made my stomach turn _num_ mins .
the place is a ghost town , i should have taken a hint .
we went there with high hopes & but got disappointment .
many of the items had just rice with charred vegetables without any spice .
even meat items had no taste .
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
it has changed hands many times and getting worst .
by the way , the tea was never delivered .
bad service .
cold food .
totally not recommended restaurant .
waste of mood .
waste of time .
waste of money .
it was terrible and the marinara tasted like ketchup .
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
the chicken was also fail .
it is quite expensive too for what you get .
not going back .
rude service .
there was confusion about chicken combo vs. chicken .
rude comments throughout dinner .
food was good but not good enough to be treated poorly .
all i can say is that i left this place utterly confused .
service was all over the place ranging from ultra attentive to absolutely clueless .
the chicken and beef were ok , yet the lamb was literally inedible .
the chicken kebab was dry and obviously reheated .
the rice was flavorless , and the onions were also old .
the only good thing was the fire roasted tomato and the beef kebab .
that 's very expensive for chicken kabob .
i do n't recommend anyone this place .
this used to be one of my favorite places on mill .
i ate here weekly for years , sometimes twice a week .
a vegetarian haven , it was .
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
anyway , after a few bad experiences i stopped going altogether .
so sad .
how i miss the good old days .
the sandwich was $ _num_ .
are you kidding me ?
the free chips and salsa are probably from costco .
i shall not be returning for overpriced simple food i can make at home .
not so impressed .
but that was it ; nothing more after that but disappointment .
such ... a ... disappointment .
the sandwiches were nothing special .
really would n't be surprised if this place closes down .
this was very disappointing !
the smell was almost overwhelming the whole time we were there .
it was low quality , high calorie and not very subtle .
the rice was probably my biggest complaint .
the tortillas , salsa and chips tasted like they came from a grocery store .
holy crap .
bad food , but lots of it .
if you have a hangover and need grease , this is your place .
for starters , the chips and salsa were pretty average .
very little spice , and not much taste at all .
rosita 's was a real disappointment .
i chose wrong .
the chips and salsa were okay , not great .
i went with the burrito and taco lunch special ; everything i was craving .
it was sorely disappointing .
unfortunately , rosita 's had none to offer .
tonight is saturday and we were the only _num_ people in there ?
yet , our server was below average ... way below .
and salsa ... had to ask twice for that as well .
overall , _num_ bucks for _num_ entrees , _num_ margaritas and _num_ beers .
nothing to complain about , but nothing to rave about either .
i went there last night , and both my boyfriend had a bad experience .
decent appetizer platter ... minus the fact that it was cold .
this place is ridiculous .
the carne asada is totally bland .
i should have gone to subway and saved myself about $ _num_ .
the refried beans were runny and the rice was n't very good .
the worst mexican food ever ... no , the worst food ever .
in phoenix for _num_ weeks for work from la .
taco bell has better tasting beans and rice than rosita 's .
the food was completely bland .
the salsa , refried beans , tamales , etc were all tasteless .
how do you mess up refried beans ?
even the chips seemed stale .
the only mexican thing about this place was the music .
the fish had no flavor at all as it had n't been seasoned .
flautas would be much better with seasoning .
my black beans where also under cooked .
it was brutal .
something must have died , it was terrible .
horrible .
this place has not changed since i worked there _num_ years ago .
the food is essentially taco bell but more expensive .
there are better restaurants just a few minutes away .
( i got black beans , and they were served in a bowl .
it seems to be the only trick the kitchen knows !
nothing special .
not authentic as they claim .
skip it .
no matter what you order the salsa and hot sauce are n't good .
the hot sauce is just not good .
if i could have a negative star i would !
are u kidding me ?
i tried to give benefit of doubt , boy was i wrong !
rip off !
do not eat here , waste of money and rip off !
horrible , totally disgusting food .
the water tasted like sewage even after adding _num_ lemon wedges to it .
the food tastes so horrible they should at least provide that .
it was okay , i 've had much better for around $ _num_ .
beans were very standard , chips and salsa were okay .
the water was absolutely horrible though .
it tasted like how sewage would taste .
i probably would n't come back .
it 's like they could care less about their customers .
this is n't bad if you want cheap and convenient and greasy mexican food .
their happy hour is cheap ( dollar off margs and 1/2 price appetizers ) .
the chips are usually a bit stale .
ten minutes to take an order is ridiculous .
the food is consistently average , but the service is just awful right now .
the tacos were $ _num_ a piece , and we 're tiny !
the burritos were also small and over-priced at $ _num_ .
the chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy .
terrible , this is just about the worst mexican i 've had in az .
and that includes taco bell .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
the server did n't seem like he even wanted to be there .
avoid .
avoid .
when it arrived i was so disappointed .
avoid .
avoid .
i have never seen guacamole like this before .
disgusting hot dump .
i complained , but nobody seemed to care .
cant understand why there were so many customers there .
no discount or offer to clean my outfit .
quesadillas are extremely lacking .
ambience : large restaurant , always somewhat busy for lunch .
verdict : mediocre .
the quality of service and food is not what it used to be .
management does not seem to care .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
food was terrible , not to mention overpriced .
i felt sick to my stomach for the next _num_ days .
avoid .
i ordered vegetable fajitas and there was minimal flavor .
the salsa was ok , but nothing special .
wishing i had just skipped this place altogether .
this time around , it was lackluster at best .
the place looked dirty , dingy .
it 's a shame too , really liked this place before .
however , went to eat there this weekend and it was truly awful .
the chicken was pink and rubbery .
not sure what happened but i would n't recommend going here anymore .
not a fan .
i ordered the veggie fajitas burrito and the fajita veggies were barely cooked .
unfortunately we waited over an hour for food that never showed up .
this was on a saturday evening at _num_ pm but this place was dead .
there were maybe 10-15 other tables in the whole restaurant .
this place smells like bug spray .
a cockroach was crawling on the wall next to us .
i lost my best friend , of _num_ years .
this made it even worse for us .
man , that was a disaster !
otherwise it would have been _num_ !
not impressed at all .
this is the 3rd place we have used to board our dog .
we used pete and mac 's our last visit and they were much better .
they did n't do anything wrong just felt like the walmart of pet hotels .
ranks 3rd out of the _num_ we have used .
i had a meeting of _num_ people and we took the back corner .
i could have just smoked my hookah at home .
if i could give this place a zero i would .
i have never been so disgusted to sit down in a place .
disgusting .
the whole place was completely unsanitary .
however , it was a total buzz kill for our saturday night .
save your money and your health and go down the street .
very rude cashier named angela , i believe .
dark hair , glasses , sour face .
so we stopped going to this qt .
the rooms are dated , and smells funky .
now , read on for the negative comments .
after traveling all day , we were exhausted .
we immediately had our room changed to a room overlooking the parking lot .
i was very wrong .
lastly , the breakfast is over-priced .
generally speaking , the hotel is `` ok '' .
the airport shuttle was very useful as well .
and the train tracks 1/2 block away make it a noisy sleep .
so all of the things i look for in a hotel - failed .
i would give it a _num_ based on location and decor .
it was like some sort of sleep torture .
needless to say , i was a wreck the next morning for my meeting .
if you want to sleep do not stay here .
i 've stayed in worse but i 've also stayed in much better .
my sister and i stayed for _num_ days for personal trip to the university .
the hotel does not have room service or in room movies to rent .
there is a little cafe within the lobby that serves only breakfast and dinner .
they serve starbucks coffee , but lack the fancy machines .
someone came up and fixed the problem .
horrible !
the rooms are disgusting .
run down is an understatement .
this is not one of the better ones .
so not too bad .
the tv has very poor reception on most channels .
the air conditioning unit in the room is old and noisy .
this wendy 's location has failed me time after time .
poor food quality is common .
walked in with my mom so she could buy some shoes .
bad service .
bad attitude .
for no solid reason .
apparently these businesses are too busy to respond to emails requesting an estimate .
apparently they are too busy to bother with a small job .
i 'm not sure when the standards for chinese food became so lax .
come on , mr. hunan , this is the southwest !
sadly i think even pei wei has more flavor .
the food is pretty standard takeout , a little bland for the most part .
last time i went , my roommate ordered `` vegetarian spring rolls . ''
if they had handled it better , i would still go back there .
did not answer the phone on multiple attempts .
horrible customer service .
there was no one in the restaurant .
the license on the wall reads _num_ .
holy god this is _num_ !
there is a bed that 's not even hidden from view .
it 's standard chinese hole-in-the-wall fare , which is n't a bad thing .
chicken , fried rice .
they had made cause it was cold .
oh did , i mention i do n't eat pork our red meat .
the frozen chinese at walmart is better than this stuff .
another hour passes by , i called again - the line was busy .
i called back , they hung up the phone .
needless to say , i never heard back from them .
this place is a dump and the food isnt much better .
incredibly disappointing service .
i mean really , really bad .
after an hour my husband called to make sure our order was n't forgotten .
the food is just not good enough for such poor service .
the others , all kind of weird .
i 'll be trying new chinese restaurants from now on .
so the food was kind of cold and mushy .
they need to hire some more help and stop being cheap .
mr. hunan why did you have to fail me ?
i ordered the chicken lo mein , big mistake .
the problem was the chicken and noodles had absolutely no flavor .
_num_ minutes later we called again and no one answered .
the food was the most awful hunan i have eaten .
customer service : _num_ star .
the dude who took my delivery order was really rude .
speed : _num_ star .
gross .
i also felt terrible after i ate them .
mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish .
overall disappointed and will definitely be trying somebody else next time .
( yup , you guessed it onions ) - see photos .
no dinner for me tonight .
i ordered over the phone for delivery and it was literally , the worst .
it takes a lot for it to be taste bad to me .
but this was almost inedible .
the rice looked like potatoes it was so overlooked .
ignored me .
i hate bad customer service .
disgusting chinese food .
and they mess up orders really easily .
bad service and nasty food .
the shrimp fried rice was not nice .
i found _num_ peas and _num_ carrot chunk in the whole thing .
it was a little difficult to communicate my order .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
still waiting on getting my money back .
at _num_ i called and was told delivery would be _num_ minutes .
my chicken skewers were dried out fatty and rubbery .
the chicken lo mein had breaded chicken in it with no flavor .
but downhill from there !
i did n't eat more than three bites of the rice .
the chicken was the worst quality of chicken i 've ever been served anywhere !
i ordered a chicken teriyaki and hunan shrimp on a very slow sunday evening .
save your money , the lunch special bbq pork was terrible .
not impressed very disgusting !
it looked and tasted like crap .
disappointed .
something smelled not right and it was the szechuan beef .
after a few bites , we threw the entire dinner away .
no suggestions or assistance was offered .
i would not rent here .
unhelpful and very rude .
this was not enjoyable .
i was unable to get a bite down without a drink .
it might be that it was 8pm or who knows .
all in all , the food here is just `` ok '' .
occasionally , the chicken arrives overcooked and dry .
however , there is nothing particularly outstanding about it , either .
s scottsdale to get take out .
now , i 'm just left disappointed .
this place does not qualify as a restaurant , mexican or otherwise .
i agree with everyone who says that the onions are way too salty .
the beans are pretty bad actually , as is the salsa .
so gross !
i do n't even want to mark this as a one star .
unfortunately , i was disappointed with this fish store on several levels .
there were several dozen tanks but each only had a couple of fish .
second , and more importantly , no one ever offered to help me .
he went into the back several times and never really offered help .
i really do n't know why this place has so many awesome reviews .
and , to me it looked just ok .
over all this place is just ok , but i think you got that .
but i just ca n't get into your pizza .
i should 've demanded a refund but was too disgusted to stay anymore .
avoid this place at all costs .
i do n't know how you 're still in business , otto 's .
we waited several minutes before being greeted by a rude young lady .
needless to say we did not stay .
was put on hold for _num_ min then hung up on .
fail .
she should n't have asked us to pay extra for her mistake .
i will not be taking another bite .
frankly , their food is n't tasty enough to warrant the risk .
_num_ stars - i 've experienced better , many times .
i assure you this is not the case .
nothing was horrible .
not appetizing at all , pushed it all to the side .
this place was unfortunately not all that amazing .
i got the combination plate and everything on it was pretty mediocre .
you can get better gyros at many other places in the valley .
there is no personality to this part of the store at all .
unfortunately , he was not our server .
hard to say .
no hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita .
it was nothing special .
i 've had better and i 've had worse .
the rice was just plain white rice .
our server had zero personality .
so i found this little market place serving mediterranean food .
chicken was burnt .
i mean it was so black , i thought i was eating a charcoal .
so $ _num_ off the tab was the only option they given me.
little salty and sour compared to others .
rice was okay , nothing special .
he had a sampler with grape leaves , meat balls , rice , etc .
not real sure about this place .
she was not happy to have women in her shop .
plus the place just looked dirty .
anyways i might give this place one more shot to try the chicken shawarma .
let me say , it was not so awesome .
i would not go back for sure .
for me it 's just okay .
i just feel that the food here is mediocre .
if you 're on a budget , however , this is your place .
food was painfully bland .
all bland .
not impressed at all .
the only good thing about this place is that it 's cheap .
lamb tongue ( chewy and horrible ! )
unfortunately , i ordered the lamb tongue and only had one bite .
wish i tried the falafel instead .
i wo n't be back .
after all the outstanding reviews i tried the chicken shawarma sandwich and some hummus .
the sandwich was not that great .
the sauce they added was all that saved my lunch .
it smelled like fish tank water .
i was disappointed after so many great reviews .
but i brushed it off and gave them another chance .
that was the last straw , i was out of there .
my family and i had an awful experience here tonight .
gross !
thinking back some of the cooks had no hair cover .
i will not be returning and would recommend to stay away .
drinks again were left bone dry .
i tried the yogurt soda which was disgusting .
skip it .
i will not be back to haji baba .
worst of all , this place should be called the dirty baba .
i was so excited to try this place after many people recommend this place .
the food arrived and all our meats were dry and hard .
rude server .
disaster .
could not give less than one star .
this is a bad way to treat your customers .
i am never going here again .
not happy at all , and wo n't be back .
not good !
ten minutes later ... and we are still waiting .
i just walked out of this place because the waiter completely ignored me .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
arrogant people , skip it , go somewhere else for authentic persian food .
besides , this is not even persian from reading the menu .
waited _num_ minutes for my food .
was n't that crowded .

besides , this is not even persian from reading the menu .
i wish she would have walked out too .
great for people watching , but unfortunately their pizza is pretty weak .
the location is crowded and waiting in line is uncomfortable .
why would you eat this garbage ?
i do n't get the crust .
it is similar to the crust used at peter piper pizza from childhood .
for what you get , it seems a little over priced .
i 'd rather drive _num_ miles to southern and mill for venezia 's pizza .
the _num_ goes straight there from slices .
it did .
star _num_ : how was the service and atmosphere ?
star _num_ : how were the portions relative to the cost ?
$ _num_ ?
sure , but we 're not .
no star granted .
stars _num_ and _num_ : how was the food ?
it did n't make me sick , so i suppose that 's a positive .
no stars granted .
star _num_ : would you eat here every day if you could ?
i probably wo n't be back .
no star granted .
lukewarm pizza under heating lamps that is dried out and extremely overpriced !
_num_ slices and tap water for $ _num_ w tax .
the inside is a little small and crowded and not good for group lunches .
it seems like the quality has dipped and the prices have gone up ?
i did n't like it .
the pizza was n't very good and was bland .
the staff was n't helpful or friendly .
not all pizzas are created equal .
however , not all pizzas are offered till 3am .
pizza was unimpressive and my slice was cold .
but we were hungry so we just chose to sit outside .
the worse service i have ever had .
she was zero help .
this is a beautiful property with the most obnoxious management .
workers were not overly friendly .
very disappointed .
the food arrived in good time and the chicken was tasty , if lukewarm .
the service was friendly , even if our waitress forgot to bring pitas .
crappy music they torture me with .
it sucks .
went there tonight .
busy place but not full .
the evening started out slow .
unfortunately that was the highlight of the plate .
the sauce on the meat was too heavy with lemon .
the dry rice was under done and again had the overpowering lemon .
sadly , the only decent main dish was my son 's spaghetti and meatballs .
the bad news ?
i wish i could give a more favorable review .
it looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is .
is greek beer supposed to be warm and flat as well ?
service was terrible .
ugh .
very disappointing greek salad .
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
service was ok , friendly but nothing special .
the beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible .
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
we were really hungry so we ate it all up .
the chicken was n't dry .
i hate this location .
i will not be going back .
i heard great things , and i just did not experience these great things .
this time the food was awful !
although my plate was full , my boyfriends portion of fish was small .
one girl had a huge rat on her shoulder and it was beyond disgusting .
she explained that the waiter was new and his section was the biggest .
would n't recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick and relaxing meal .
hands down the most bland food i 've ever had .
all other parties at the table were disappointed as well .
went there for a lunch recently , and was somewhat disappointed .
wrong !
so ridiculous !
the food was decent , nothing to get overly excited about .
big disappointment .
we 've gone back _num_ times and each time gets worse .
we will not be going back !
i thought they had really turned things around for a while there .
that alone is enough to not want to make another visit .
this one was definitely the worst they have ever made for me .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
how can you mess up a greek salad too ?
the falafel , disgusting .
big portions , slow service , bland sides .
i wo n't be back anytime soon , but glad i got to go .
the venue looks nice , was clean , and a little bit confusing .
that gyro was damn pitiful and for that this place gets _num_ stars .
the food is generally very dry and does n't seem very fresh .
there was not a lot of tzatziki sauce so it was kinda dry .
never have i a paid _num_ for a worst salad .
worst service i 've ever experienced at a restaurant .
sat there for _num_ minutes before getting up and leaving .
the water at this venue is terrible .
ultimately drinking it is not good for your body .
the veg was also under seasoned , just bland tasting food .
not sure i can go back with all the choices around there .
the service was good , but all of the food i had was lacking .
i wo n't be back .
the service in the place is awful .
then it took forever to get my check .
i 'd give zero star if possible .
as it stands now it ca n't seem to get much worse .
the best way i can describe my experience here tonight is just meh .
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
this place has went downhill in a serious way since i was last here .
most unfortunate indeed .
service was so slow .
the pita bread is fluffy and soft with a mild flavor .
the gyro is dry and off putting .
the salmon i ordered was raw and fishy in flavor .
this place is n't worth your money .
my wife and i ate here last night .
i had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce .
so what 's wrong ?
i paid _num_ $ a month for a level _num_ ( gold ) membership .
do not i repeat do not go to this location !
i ended up staying in the whole time .
i was pretty disappointed , but it was free .
i will not be returning here again !
every time i walked in no one was at the front desk .
after the discount , they were $ _num_ .
then i checked amazon and they were $ _num_ .
ugh these guys are a rip off .
i came in with a groupon and she was very accommodating .
unfortunately i am pretty pale , so i really need a darker spray tan .
i ended up buying store bought tanning products to make myself darker .
worst tanning experience i have ever had .
the tanning rooms are extremely tiny , and the ceilings and walls are gross .
if i could give it negative stars i would .
so over the top pissed off at the management here .
there are not words to describe how completely horrible this place is .
maria the manager is a horrible person .
there are cops here almost every weekend .
we moved from across the country into this crap hole .
please do not rent from these people .
the prices are cheap and you get even less than what you pay for .
if there was only an option for zero stars !
not only do other reviewers dislike this place , i regret living here .
the woman was horribly dressed .
she was very rude .
the apartment she showed us was filthy and smelled horribly of mold and mildew .
very poor conditions on the property .
i would honestly choose zero stars if i could .
the office staff will flat out lie to you .
run far away from this place .
this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food .
for friday hh there is usually a dj .
this was the most embarrassing , disgusting night i 've had at a restaurant .
no apology , no words at all , from the waiter .
they , too , offered no apology .
avoid it like the plague .
surprisingly the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
i finished off the meal with sopapillas that were really tasty .
the problem came later .
that was not good .
i 'm all about food though .
we had mini chimis , beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy .
the spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too .
this place sucks .
to top it off , the bartender was slow as shit .
the service was poor ( slow , order came out wrong ) .
the food is nothing special and the prices average .
all show , no delicious burrito .
it is not , however , a good mexican restaurant .
the service was very slow .
chimichanga was the best dish i sampled , but it was not impressive .
they tasted ok ... not much of a drink special .
i grew up on authentic and traditional mexican food , macayo 's is neither .
the chicken was barely cooked and not seasoned or marinated at all .
horrible , horrible food .
when we arrived _num_ % of the restaurant was full .
_num_ minutes after that our server took both drink and food orders .
then it was another _num_ before we received the drinks !
then another _num_ goes by and the food comes out , fairly quickly .
but they only brought out half the food .
one of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held .
another beer was ordered and did n't show up until we were finished eating .
bad decision .
note to macayo 's : enchilada sauce should be red not orange .
the only dinner that was edible was mom 's appetizer sampler plate .
the food is your typical mexican chain food .
this place makes me hate mexican food .
everything is fried ... bland and gross .
i know that other people have raved about their $ _num_ beer happy hours .
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
attention , general manager ... ... you have a problem .
went to lunch here for the 1st time in a while .
this place is pretty disgusting .
gross food .
bad service .
worst happy hour .
the mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy .
eat at your own risk - i 'm not going back .
$ _num_ beer , a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour .
unfortunately the music is way _num_ loud when you get in .
its really difficult to have a conversation .
the free food has made me sick on more than _num_ occasion .
no bueno .
like we had done something wrong .
in short , he sucked .
wo n't be going back .
i recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago .
consistently bad service for mediocre food and drinks .
i only end up there for convenience ... apparently the service staff thinks differently .
our server was nice but not very informed or attentive .
i was extremely disappointed in the food .
literally the worst happy hour ever .
do not go there for the free buffet there is a reason its free .
not even mexican food .
drinks were no big deal and overpriced for happy hour .
big mistake going here .
he was full of it and could really care less .
dont make the same mistake !
the flavor for the most part , bland .
i should have stayed and made them sin .
no i did n't punch him in the face .
it 's never my choice .
i did not pick this place , met some people there that picked it .
service sucks and they are dishonest .
i did not pick this place , met some people there that picked it .
service sucks and they are dishonest .
the food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive .
on its best day this place is mediocre .
i went there most recently for sunday football ticket with _num_ friends .
if he waits on you , be prepared to wait on him .
lazy as hell .
does n't rate one star .
to say food was horrible is being kind .
and the food was meh and really not very good .
classic tempe location should not be confused with quality food .
i can not believe i have n't reviewed this place !
their meat is horrible .
so why _num_ stars and not _num_ ?
i was very disappointed with my recent visit to this macayo 's .
i had not been to a macayo 's in at least three years .
first off this restaurant is dirty .
first bad sign .
do n't know how that even happens .
the chips and salsa were just okay .
the chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery .
the service was bad .
mediocre at best .
i had a baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada .
my fianc had a bean burrito enchilada style .
the baja chicken enchilada was pretty good .
the cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh .
the red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy .
will not be back here .
way too many other great mexican options in town .
i dunno , i do n't really pay attention , ha sorry . ''
then they went back to talking to each other before i could respond .
$ _num_ for a corona ?
that is ridiculous .
for just $ _num_ more i can buy _num_ of them .
also , their margaritas are n't anything special .
no thanks .
first , i ordered a standard margarita .
all together , about $ _num_ overcharged !
`` sorry , there is nothing i can do . ''
we left with nothing after sitting here for an hour and a half .
worst service and business management ever .
dining experience started off really bad !
we got nachos with beef , guacamole , and baja sauce .
unfortunately the food and drink did n't measure up .
this place for some reason has gone downhill .
* shark tacos - i thought the shark meat gave an interesting twist .
the shark meat was slightly on the salty side though .
rice and beans makes a bland burrito .
well , it 's mighty hard to mess up nachos .
i probably wo n't come back .
i visited macayo 's because i heard that they had a gluten-free menu .
my fajitas were very bland in flavor .
gross .
again , guac was gummy with a strange taste .
my partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor .
again , gross .
they were extremely slow waiting on us even though the place was empty .
needless to say i wo n't be back .
came here before an asu game , it was slammed .
horrible ownership and management for something like this to happen .
service was horrible !
so disappointed !
mediocre mexican food !
food was totally plain jane and overly greasy .
not impressed .
this was my first meal in tempe , recommended by our hotel concierge .
i have n't been to depot cantina in several years .
both sauces were awful .
we asked for more of the watery , chunky salsa for her .
i ordered two enchiladas , and all rice , no beans .
my wife ordered the chile relleno , all beans , no rice .
the enchiladas were okay , but the rice was dismal .
we get there and it 's empty -- literally not another table there .
the food sucks -- delivered cold .
bad move on the part of the restaurant .
food and services were terrible -- will not return .
this restaurant is extremely poorly managed -- - double charge ?
beware : they over charge !
they refused to even correct the problem even though it was n't our fault .
only _num_ tables were occupied at 7pm .
should have been a warning !
i 'm sure it will be a meal that you never forget !
we will not be back !
this is not the case .
it 'll likely be another _num_ before i return .
i do n't blame our server really .
she seemed very busy and likely did n't have the support she needed .
i do not recommend macayo 's in any way , shape or form .
now , i feel like i 'm going to a funeral that has food .
it really does not encourage you to come inside .
the owners have sadly not maintained the restaurant or updated the menu .
the food has become drab .
he could n't even finish his beer .
we are convinced it was the lettuce and poor hygiene from the kitchen staff .
terrible terrible service !
drinks were weak .
even the manager could n't help us with better service .
instead of the waitress apologizing she just disappeared !
i will not go back !
hate that we wasted so much money there with our group .
i had a carne asada burro and the others had chicken and beef enchiladas .
nothing had any flavor at all !
this is the worst mexican food i have ever eaten !
the management response to this review will not change our minds .
i had a carne asada burro and the others had chicken and beef enchiladas .

this is the worst mexican food i have ever eaten !
the management response to this review will not change our minds .
unfortunately the food was cold by the time it arrive to our table .
the chips was stale , had to be sent back .
our waitress did not have much knowledge of the food .
quite disappointed .
we had to ask someone else to wipe off the counter .
not good enough for me , we will never go back there again !
that entire experience put a bad taste in my mouth for all macayo 's .
would have not given any stars at all but that was not an option !
yeah this place sucked .
i 'm giving macayos money ... not the other way around .
extremely disappointed .
then my mother in law ordered a patron margarita , it was over poured ?
poor bar staff to say the least .
just my _num_ cents .
will not be back .
they cost me around $ _num_ .
am told it will take _num_ minutes .
i come back , the bike 's in the same state .
no sign of it .
designed to fall out ?
horrible service .
after _num_ minutes they had one bike ready to go .
after contacting her for the second time , she refused to provide a refund .
truly horrible service .
when i am setting up for my first shoot my lens just falls off .
i do n't know how it could have been broken '' .
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
why would anyone want that if the first scan was good to begin with ?
terrible service and extremely unfriendly .
i asked for honor and she said no .
they are way over priced .
they want money ... you got money ... enough said .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
no other lens rental place charges the price of the lens as a deposit .
this store is not set up very well .
i get what i need and i am out bitches !
ridiculous .
i 'm going to get the lens somewhere else and later reverse my charge .
horrible customer service .
they even gave me a couple batteries , which was very nice .
i then proceeded upstairs to the sales dept .
he was challenging and not at all helpful .
the rental equipment was far from new .
so tempe camera robbed me again after their and my equipment was stolen !
the worst service i have ever had .
terrible customer service .
after shooting with it for one day the camera i was trying out broke .
never i repeat never take anything here to get fixed .
thousands of dollars lost .
unfortunately , the customer service was lackluster and left much to be desired .
customer service is not great either .
me : okay , thanks .
not in the actual tempe camera building , but next door .
overall in image quality , very poor .
price - $ _num_ for _num_ rolls of film done in one day .
_num_ ) nicer customer service .
if they do do this , that was n't explained .
brought in two camera lenses to have them repaired and cleaned .
sure , some of this is just bad luck .
seriously not worth giving your business to .
not a promising sign .
however when you go to pay , you can pay separately .
to sum it up it was a sub par experience at least for me .
i was n't impressed , but rather underwhelmed .
worst service i think i 've ever received .
i feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment .
vegetables were n't cooked all the way through .
we were one of _num_ tables and had to wait _num_ minutes for food .
we all ate cereal at home it was so bad .
cold , not cooked , no flavor .
not impressed .
the service was n't that great and my tacos were very greasy .
in terms of taste however , he said that it was okay .
moreover , they have pepsi instead of coke .
the service at this place is horrible .
it took forever to get drink refills , salsa for our chips , etc .
asking for extra water , salsa , etc .
worst service we have ever experienced .
we came on a friday for lunch and the place was not very busy .
i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
the food quality was bland with no flavor .
this is not authentic mexican food .
i tried this place for the first time .
we immediately stopped eating and called the waiter to our table .
we walked out and will never be back again .
things happen , the place did n't look dirty .
charging for a second serving of chips or any salsa with entrees .
rice was dry as well as the tamale .
could 've have just gotten some at the store and microwaved it myself .
disgusting .
i had the _num_ shrimp tacos they were pretty good to be honest .
nice little place but rude staff .
i will not be returning .
but after two tries i will look elsewhere .
the table seemed bare , salt but no pepper or hot sauce .
why waste my time and money here ?
was treated poorly because i am a female .
took my car in to diagnose leak in my a/c system .
had previously had some repairs done and the problem was still not fixed .
i was told it was 1st come , 1st served .
i sat there for _num_ hours .
_num_ hours !
evil and odd how that happens .
we also ordered a red velvet and a vanilla bean cupcake .
what a rude staff !
rude rude rude !
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .
this is the worst starbucks i have ever gone to .
i did n't notice it being any quicker than any other starbucks .
i avoid this store from now on .
putting a much more sour taste than the coffee in my mouth .
if i could give a _num_ i would .
upon entering , i noticed the cafe was packed .
the street people and homeless were loud and rude .
this is absolutely the worst starbucks ever .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
the scottsdale waterfront location is even worse .
if you must go to one of them choose the mills ave one .
she was horribly unhelpful and almost rude at that .
false advertisement at its best urban .
small , clean in a do n't touch anything kind of way .
i was charged additionally for each of my _num_ dogs .
the wifi stinks , useless really .
the surrounding area is not the best part of town .
some rough looking young people .
i was there _num_ night .
wo n't be back .
the service is incredibly rude and unprofessional .
avoid at all costs !
he also said he did n't see it as being a problem .
i do n't see what the issue is .
i explained i couldnt as my husband was at work with our truck .
she was very rude and upset as if this was my fault .
she said large dogs are no longer welcome .
i can see that they are n't full as she claimed they would be .
woman who answers the phone having a bad life .
i ask her why she asked and she refuses my reservation !
really , you could n't give me the code ?
poorly ran facility , i would never recommend or stay here again .
worst customer service ever !
the sales people here are terrible .
i can not wait to see this business fail due to the economy .
it 's very disappointing and upsetting .
staff is rude and not helpful .
clearly she had no idea what i was talking about .
no stars !
but that no one would help me get the fabric .
they were rude to each other and to the customers .
do n't ever expect the staff to be nice or friendly .
this place is a mess .
very disappointed .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
indeed , there was history in this restaurant and on the walls .
why they are little sichuan i do n't know .
this place 's food does not even remotely taste like sichuan food .
just if they do make sichuan food they would be able to do this .
i ordered chicken eggplant .
nothing to it , not prepared correctly and the chicken was stringy and dry .
ok i did not get sick + _num_ hours from lunch .
well i took one bite and did not eat another .
the meat tasted strange and i thought someone has put soap in my mouth .
fast food hong kong tastes like fast food chinese in usa .
but ... personality does not a good chinese restaurant make .
it is not really brown rice .
it is white rice made to look brown by adding soy sauce .
awful , awful , awful !
its like dining in the middle of a garage sale .
but man , it 's just not anything special , and also overpriced .
they get neither right .
food was not great at all .
atmosphere not great either .
the food is best described as boring .
i 've tried _num_ different dishes and they all were below average at best .
_num_ stars because it 's cheap .
tried this place for lunch last week .
so anyway , i come here with a coworker and we sit down .
the place is pretty busy , which seemed like a good sign .
not a good sign .
i ordered the kung pao chicken ... it was awful .
there is just no other way to say it .
terrible .
here 's the thing : my dish was $ _num_ .
even on that standard , i give it a _num_ out of _num_ .
therefore , we paid this place a visit .
that takes them _num_ minutes to make .
and she gave me _num_ more pairs .
first time here , but never to return .
this place is creepy !
got the runs the next day , ugh .
was told it would be ready in _num_ minutes .
gave them a little extra time and got there _num_ minutes later .
i just left , probably could have taken a few shots for the road .
so disappointed .
the chicken appears to be pretty good quality but really soggy .
the chicken lo mein was the most ridiculous of any i have ever had .
the noodles are huge and gross .
the chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too big .
however i did not enjoy the food .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
so disappointing , at least it was cheap .
yet i 've had _num_ times better chinese food around the same price .
chinese food in tempe is weak , i will not be coming back here .
so i said i guess i can go without dinner tonight .
really not impressed really not happy with the lack of customer service .
the main dishes were covered in what seem like oil and salt .
we were very disappointed .
sadly , i can not recommend this place .
not good , i would never go back .
i am literally counting down the days until my lease ends .
( _num_ days if you 're wondering ) .
our ac and tub both clogged yesterday right after their office closed .
luckily , it 's still under warranty so it will be fixed .
the units are old and have lots of weird problems .
they do n't have a drop box for rent .
and if you ca n't , then your rent could be late .
maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management do n't care .
this place is under new management _num_ .
one thing i can not overlook is bad service ... .
a bowl of onions with _num_ meatballs !
sure , no problem .
that was it for me ... ... go to taco bell !
okay , so i went there for lunch today with my son , jacob .
jacob 's burro was not too bad .
my nachos , however , were inedible !
the chicken was lukewarm and really funky tasting .
the burro was okay , not great .
all in all , a pretty unpleasant experience .
we got there and had to wait around _num_ minutes for a table .
what a nightmare !
the chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment .
how long was the meat sitting ?
it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant .
the food was n't very good , however .
do n't do business with this company !
this place saw me coming a mile away .
boy was i wrong !
my car was n't starting and i was desperate for a fix .
they then told me the fuel pump was broken and needed to be replaced .
so i spent another $ _num_ on that .
about five days later , it would not start again .
needless to say , i did n't go back .
me : this bill would total close to $ _num_ .
however , they lied .
well they may have dropped the fuel tank and washed it .
shame on me for not doing my research on the price .
i care about if they fix my car or not .
i know why they have _num_ stars , just because customer service .
but believe me , they will never fix your car 's problem .
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
what ever you do , do not think twice about using this company .
i could not have been more wrong .
fast forward to today ... truck started falling apart again .
nothing covered under warranty ... $ _num_ .
well , $ _num_ to do the diagnostic and $ _num_ for the tow .
not under their warranty either ... do n't ask me how .
i have never been yelled at before by a supposed professional .
wo n't be returning to get robbed again in the future .
as i stated above , i find this place disgusting .
get all quotes in writing !
they next day the price they quoted me was different yet again .
the prices constantly change here so beware of that .
that same six pack will be eight or nine dollars elsewhere .
except their prices are nearly double a normal store price .
not really a deal , and poor selection .
i totally agree with lou on this ... totally overpriced and crappy selection .
the customer service was awful .
ugh .
people , stick with total wine .
the employee appeared to stop the swing before it hit the guy .
obviously never went back here .
besides being ridiculously rude , they have very inflated prices .
even then i 'd say walk the distance to the safeway down the street .
the desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size .
i 've had better japanese bakery items elsewhere .
looks like i 'm breaking the trend of five-star reviews .
i just feel that in this case , it 's hype .
turns out they could n't even give me black but dark brown instead .
my custard bun was pretty lackluster .
