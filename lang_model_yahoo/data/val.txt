does the church of christ believe in being `` born again '' ? yes , you must be born again to be saved . the main difference between _UNK and baptists on this is at what point one is considered to be born again . the bible shows that one is born again when a _UNK believer is baptized . romans _UNK says at baptism , you `` rise to walk in _UNK of life . '' this is the point where one contacts the death and saving blood of christ , _UNK the old man of sin , and begins this new life . birth is the beginning of new life . jesus said , `` he that believes and is baptized shall be saved .

explain why people complain about $ _UNK for gasoline , when they are willing to spend $ _UNK for water ? it 's a very good question . it 's called value perception . a 2 liter bottle of a soft drink , close to half a gallon is considered a bargain at over a dollar . so it has been $ 2+ per gallon for years , no complaints , a bottle of starbucks _UNK comes to about $ 8 per gallon . anyone complaining ? a chevy and _UNK pickup are pretty much the exact same vehicle , the _UNK is more expensive and holds its _UNK value longer . it all has to do with what consumers perceive to be value . since gasoline does not come in packaging , and is a more or less invisible substances pumped into cars and trucks it is difficult for a consumer to place a tangible value on it .

'' _UNK is very common . approximately one percent of the population across the world _UNK . because it 's genetically based , _UNK runs in families . however , it also requires early childhood stress to manifest itself - a new sibling , a new school , or some other source of childhood anxiety . _UNK usually begins between the ages of four and seven . fortunately , it can now be effectively treated .

what will we see when the sun dies ? our sun will not supernova . it will , over a very long time , expand into a relatively small red giant , which will have a diameter greater than the earth 's orbit . long before that the earth will have become far too hot to live on , but the process will be very , very slow -- it 'll take over a billion years -- not a giant explosion . sorry to disappoint you . i know , you sound like you were looking forward to it . funny how many people answering this question think otherwise . i guess that 's the irony of the internet for you . see the link below for all the details :
how does internal pressure of a sealed vessel affect its buoyancy ? if you were in a sealed vessel just below the surface of the ocean , and were able to control several chambers of air under very high pressure , how would the decrease of pressure in a high pressure section affect the _UNK of the entire vessel ? my understanding is that air has mass - more pressure in a chamber would mean more air - therefore , moving mass ( or pressure ) from one portion of the sealed vessel to another would shift the mass , be it ever so slightly . this would not affect the _UNK of the vessel , but may change its orientation ever so slightly . _UNK to being in a boat and moving from the front to the back - the back would drop slightly , and front would raise slightly . however , as stated , the buoyancy of the `` entire '' vessel would not be affected .

how do u separate _UNK _UNK water ? give the method given that _UNK and water are not _UNK , and have a different density , a _UNK could separate the two liquids . also , since water boils at 100 c and freezes at 0 c , while _UNK will boil at more than 150 c and freeze at less than 0 c , then heating of _UNK the substance would allow distillation separation , or the creation of a hydrocarbon water _UNK that could be treated _UNK separation . your best best is distillation , still . that is how crude oil ( which does contain water ) is treated anyway .
good science experiments that _UNK measuring time , distance , speed or mass ? i need ideas for a science experiments that has to involve measuring something . my science teacher only said that it can only be something that has to have data ... so some kind of measurements . any ideas ? depending on the resources you have available you could do an _UNK with rockets ( small ones _UNK at the store ) . with this you could measure the time in the air , distance traveled , speed would be difficult but you could get an average if you had the distance and time . and by changing the _UNK of the rockets would give you measurements on mass . you would have to keep the angle at which you launched them at a constant . ( keep in mind the wind factor if out doors ) other wise if you are looking to only hit one of those topics i suggest testing the mass of objects using water displacement .
can we one day live on the moon ? yes ! if you hit your head with a brick ... .
how is it that we put man on the moon before we figured out it would be a good idea to put wheels on _UNK ? everything is a matter of necessity . the fact that mankind seemed perfectly content to drag a large case around simply meant that no one took the time to look at the problem . in the case of the moon america was in the space race ( also the invention of the atom bomb ) and spent billions of dollars , located the brightest scientist , and used the best resources to beat russia , ( who in all respects won ) . it was a matter of necessity in the minds of the people in power to solve that problem and they did . just think , if the government would drive that much time and money into finding an alternative fuel source . the possibilities could be amazing !

why the sky is blue ? ? ? the blue color of the sky is due to rayleigh scattering . as light moves through the atmosphere , most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through . little of the red , orange and yellow light is affected by the air . however , much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules . the absorbed blue light is then _UNK in different directions . it gets scattered all around the sky . whichever direction you look , some of this scattered blue light reaches you . since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue . as you look closer to the horizon , the sky appears much _UNK in color . to reach you , the scattered blue light must pass through more air . some of it gets scattered away again in other directions . less blue light reaches your eyes . the color of the sky near the horizon appears _UNK or white .

why normal human body temperature is much higher than most comfortable `` room '' air temperature ? why not equal ? your body burns fuel to get the energy it needs to function . just like any other combustion process , this generates heat . since metabolism happens constantly , your body constantly generates heat . in order to keep a constant temperature , your body has to balance heat production against heat loss . it turns out that this is easiest when the air temperature is less than your body temperature , since you will lose excess heat to the air . that 's why around _UNK ( _UNK ) tends to be comfortable for most people . if the air temperature is the same as body temperature , you can only loose _UNK heat through the _UNK cooling provided by sweating . this is n't as effective a process , so temperatures near body temperature are n't generally comfortable . in fact , if the temperature is enough hotter than body temperature , sweating is no longer sufficient to maintain your internal temperature . as a result , the heat quickly becomes fatal .

what do you think about the idea ? please read more . ? i mean is it possible to trap a light ray between two parallel mirrors ? has it been done before if yes then where ? thanks i can not tell you whether or not it has been done ... but i will never be truly `` trapped '' even with a mirror with a fairly high finish ( aka 1-2 _UNK ) there is still a loss every time it `` bounces '' off the mirror + if you do not do it in a vacuum there will be _UNK losses as well . _UNK if it is `` trapped '' it would n't stay there for _UNK
what is the speed of dark ? i have heard it said before that things travel at the speed of light , but is there a speed of dark ? darkness has no speed . however if you could put a speed to darkness it would be amazing . if you could actually produce the absence of light , you would have created pure _UNK . as of right now , darkness does n't have a speed because it is nothing . that is like saying how much am i worth , if you do n't have money . technically you 're worth $ 0 but am i trying to say that you are worth the absence of money . you do n't have money so your worth nothing . darkness is n't something that has a speed because it is the absence of light . i guess a better analogy would be : the absence of money has no worth .
why is the no . of moles of a substance equal to mass by molecular mass ? i will assume you mean `` mass divided by molecular mass . '' the molecular mass is , by definition , the mass of one mole of a substance . thus , if you take a given mass and divide it by the molar mass , you will get the number of moles . a good way to do this is to use _UNK analysis , where you start with you mass ( x grams ) use your molar mass as the conversion ( z _UNK ) and multiply the two so that the grams cancel , leaving you with moles .
rock hunting sites ? i just moved to the albany ny area . does anyone know any good rock or fossil collecting sites in the general vicinity of the _UNK hudson valley region ? it 's not right in your area , but in your state . try contacting the _UNK valley _UNK _UNK association . they make stone tools like arrow heads and spear points , so they might be able to share some places to find _UNK and related _UNK rocks . also , the town of _UNK ny is the source of the famous _UNK diamonds , which are not really diamonds but nicely shaped quartz crystals . it 's not far from you on the _UNK . if you want to take a day trip into connecticut , the whole connecticut river valley has lots of _UNK , ( the ct state stone ) . contact some gem or rock shops , they can probably put you in touch with local collectors . enjoy !

why is it that all _UNK accelerate towards the earth at the same times ? ? this is a science question on my homework ... please can you help me ? ? you mean at the same rate - _UNK feet per second per second . gravity pulls on all matter at the same rate . if you drop a bowling ball taped to a baseball , they will fall at the same rate . but it is not because the bowling ball is pulling on the baseball , it is because gravity is pulling on both of them . if the tape breaks gravity will still be pulling on both of them at the same rate . they will hit the ground at the same speed , however , they will hit with different forces . because force = mass x acceleration . the acceleration is the same for both of them . but the mass of the bowling ball is larger than the mass of the baseball , so it will hit the ground with more force .
is it possible to control the gender of the _UNK baby ? you can improve your chances . sperm determine sex . a y chromosome is lighter than an x chromosome . so , if you _UNK sperm , the _UNK ' will be a higher fraction than the heavier _UNK ' . it 's done in animals all the time . it 's not 100 % , but it sure increases the odds .
is the concept of space time an _UNK to explain the _UNK ? it is the results of _UNK work on relativity . _UNK showed gravity cause space-time to warp which will affect how objects interact with each other . newton explained gravity as the attraction one object has for another , _UNK theory 's have made up for some of newton 's short falls , such as mercury 's orbit which does n't stay the same each time changes with each orbit . newton laws do n't account for this change but _UNK theory 's predict these changes exactly . theory 's of space-time were never design to explain the ether .
if lightning never strikes in the same place twice , how can it storm w/out running out of room to strike ? eventually will it just stop _UNK ? the statement has little to actually do with lightning , especially these days . it really applies to human nature and events . before the advent of tall buildings and lightning rods , it was rare for lightning to strike the same location twice ; there were many likely targets . while it could happen , it was outside the daily experience of most people , and back then , that 's about all they had to work with . the statement came to mean any event that rarely happened twice to the same person or group ; like a previous poster said , winning the lottery twice , or any other event that 's rare enough the first time , and extremely unlikely the second .

what effect does sugar have on ice ? can i get a source please adding sucrose to water is a very endothermic reaction . that means it requires heat to make the sucrose dissolve . if you added a bunch of sucrose ( sugar ) to a glass of water at room temperature , the temperature of the water would drop and the solution would become cold as the sucrose dissolved . so , putting sucrose on ice should either do nothing since there is not enough energy to make it dissolve and interact with the water molecules ... or ... . if there was enough energy , the sucrose would start to dissolve causing the ice to become even colder ! adding sugar to water makes the temperature drop like a rock ( this is fact ) , as for ice i would expect the same thing ... .that 's only my opinion , i could be wrong .

how will earth die ? if one thing is certain it is that life on earth will end and earth itself will eventually die . how will this happen ? the earth itself ( not life on earth ) could die in about 4-5 billion years time . as the sun comes to the end of it 's life , it will expand and _UNK the orbits of mercury , venus and possibly earth too . if it does n't _UNK earth then the earth will remain in orbit around the huge sun until the sun has _UNK ' off it 's outer layers and _UNK to a white dwarf . the earth could then be released from it 's orbit if the sun 's gravity has diminished enough , and set out on it 's own way through our solar system and galaxy . what happens then is anyone 's guess ... .
ideal gas law and hot air _UNK ... . ? i have to : use the ideal gas law to explain why a hot air balloon floats i know that : when the gas burner at the base of the balloon is turned on , the air molecules in the balloon start to heat up and move around more . the air molecules have moved away from each other so much that some of them are forced to come out of the bottom of the balloon . fewer and fewer molecules are left in the balloon . it starts to rise because the total mass of air in the balloon has decreased , but the volume has remained the same , so the balloon now has a lower density than the air around it . but i do n't know how to use the ideal gas law to explain that _UNK as the air is heated the average kinetic energy of the molecules increases . ie p _UNK v is constant . so some gas molecules escape through the bottom . hence the density decreases and becomes _UNK than that of surrounding _UNK the balloon rises .
why is _UNK ? and why is it true more generally ? as in _UNK . it 's pretty obvious if you write out the multiplication : ... ... _UNK ... _UNK -- -- -- -- -- - ... ... _UNK ... _UNK _UNK _UNK -- -- -- -- -- _UNK _UNK _UNK x _UNK = _UNK x 1 + _UNK x 10 + _UNK x 100 + _UNK x 1000 = 1 x 1 + ( 1+1 ) x 10 + ( _UNK ) x 100 ... . each row is _UNK and each row shifts one to the left . the nice symmetry would break down after _UNK , because then you 'd have to start carrying .

why disc brakes for bikes are not provided for rear wheels in common ? often disc brakes in bikes are there for both front and rear wheels only in race bikes . nearly all motorcycles have front and rear disc brakes but normally the rear brake is a smaller single disc as opposed to a larger twin disc set up at the front . this is because the weight of the bike mainly transfers to the front under braking hence the need for powerfull brakes up front ... .the rear gets lighter so only minimal amount of braking power is needed so as not to lock up the rear wheel .
anyone think that the cardinals are a playoff contender ? ? with new _UNK like _UNK and leinart . are they more of a complete team now and will it _UNK them to the top of the league ? i do n't think so . with the way the nfl is these days , they could easily find a way into the playoffs , but i _UNK n't consider them a championship caliber team . their greatest strength is their offense . they have a great rb , two phenomenal wr 's , and a very good qb in kurt warner . the also added a potential _UNK te in leonard pope , so their biggest concern _UNK will be whether or not their ol will gel and perform at a productive level . _UNK that is where they need the most _UNK . they upgraded the secondary last year and need for alot of their younger guys to take the next step . all of that being said , i think we should definitely see an improvement on last years _UNK team as long as kurt warner can stay healthy , he is the key .

several games have been decided by bad calls from the refs . we see this every wc . why does fifa allow this ? one the one hand , one has always to remember that refs are only human beings , too , which happen to make mistakes . one the other hand , the fifa sometimes ranks football only 2nd in importance . in the council for _UNK at the fifa , football powers like _UNK or _UNK have more votes than the countries where football is celebrated at the highest level . why ? because the fifa ( or let 's say _UNK ) needed the votes of these countries for his re-election ... but things have improved : in contrast to the last wc , the fifa has decided to let the teams of refs play who usually play together in the leagues ... so they talk the same language and know each other .

why do women tend to _UNK men that dog them ? the first thing you should know is that not all women do this . aside from that , i 've found there are two major reasons why this would be the case : 1 . we all sometimes want what we ca n't have . if someone comes along that we just can not please , we may get so consumed with the rejection that we keep trying to win that person over . 2 . perhaps more deeply rooted , this could be a problem _UNK from _UNK . if the girl had the kind of father who never made her feel she was enough or who was not present , she may seek out men who make her feel this way because it is all she has known from the first man in her life . you can test this out . notice girls who do n't take crap or who love being spoiled and 9 times out of 10 they either _UNK great relationships with their fathers or have a very strong mother who showed them how much they are worth .

why are marriage problems so common at the _UNK mark ? a question i answered earlier made me wonder about this ... it 's refered to as `` the seven year itch '' , is that right ? what is the dynamic at play ... and is there anything scientific about this phenomenon ? its called comfort zone and lack of communication and taking each other for granted . couples tend to have children prior to 7 years and the children take a priority in the relationship and the couple _UNK to be `` a couple '' . they do n't date each other , enjoy each other and all they talk about is work , being tired and kids . the other mark is 13 years .

what 's more rude : not inviting children to the reception or having a cash bar ? ... ? i vote for not inviting children to the reception . i mean having all of your family members there celebrating with you is more important than your guests getting their free drink on . i mean , as long as there is the standard fare : champagne and wine then there 's nothing wrong with cash bars . but not inviting the kids , that 's mean . what do you all think ? invite the kids , but put them in a sound proof room with a babysitter while you are saying your vows . have a cash bar , but charge 2 bucks a drink : ) you pay the rest

would you like to marry me if i were poor ? if yes then pm me ? no , as i have no idea who you are . a man 's money , or lack of it , does n't matter to me when i first meet him . his willingness to improve his financial position , for his own _UNK , does . women usually marry to have children so it 's better if the man is able to contribute towards the family . this is such an odd question , i ca n't help but think that you are either desperate or else you are a wealthy guy who is trying to _UNK out _UNK in some way . good luck anyway . p.s . ultimately , character traits like honesty , integrity , _UNK are much more important than how much cash a man has .

why do we love the people who do n't ever care about us ? i mean : i have a friend , she never asks about me or how is it going with me , but i ca n't stop care for her . no we as humans do not love to be rejected , we as humans have the need to be loved as much as we love others , it is just like the one person said free will comes into the mix , that other person is also right in that you have a good heart , do n't ever change , being of kind heart will reward you in the end , try making new friends , some friends are for different reasons and seasons , some are long term , some are short term , i 'm 50 , i have had many friends like that , i learned to still love them , just not to brake my heart over their lack of caring , it is just the way they are

how do you help an alcoholic who does n't want help ? the man i love has chosen alcohol over me and his family . has anyone ever been in this same situation and have it work out in a good way or should i just give up and call it quits ? usually nothing changes until the alcoholic hits rock bottom . sometimes even when that happens they refuse to change . my wife had to make a hard decision to not associate with her father because he refused to give up alcohol . many times there is no easy answer . if any abuse is involved ( and usually there is ) you have to protect the other members of the family by refusing to compromise or allow any of it go on . three things are needed 1 ) intense prayer 2 ) _UNK concerning expected behavioral changes 3 ) clear action to back up the _UNK . make it clear that you love the person but that change is mandatory and in everyone 's best interest including the alcoholic . god bless you

who thinks it 's fare that american tax payers spend 28 billion dollars a year to teach english to illegal _UNK immigrants bring a wonderful _UNK environment to this country . illegal immigrants are the financial drowning of this country . this is a perfect example why liberalism drives a country into an economic death spiral . there 's only so much government money to go around , and as long as we 're spending big chunks of it on illegals aliens and people who scam welfare , then people who truly need help will be denied it . i 'll say it for the _UNK time . there is nothing more harmful to a person in true need than a liberal .

( a man _UNK is more _UNK to get the charges dropped if it is the middle of winter and his _UNK is starving ... he committed a crime for a morally right reason . ) so if you are shown to be a _UNK person then the impact of what you say has less meaning . non moral people are considered as _UNK and such . thats why a _UNK will always try to _UNK someone when they are on the stand so what they say does n't have a very big impact on the case .

will republicans in congress _UNK democrat legislation to just make democrats seem ineffective ? some new democrat senators , like jim webb and bob casey , do n't agree with much of the democrat platform and are likely to vote with the republicans on some major issues . also , the two independent party senators may occasionally vote with the republicans . as for his veto power , president bush has not used it so far . he may find himself backed into a corner and have to use it , but at least the senate is sufficiently balanced that it will probably not often be necessary . few presidents or governors like to use the veto , as it is seen as a negative . democrat governor mel _UNK of missouri was an exception , who ruled by his veto power in _UNK of both sides of the state legislature . unfortunately for _UNK , the _UNK regime continues with _UNK and robin _UNK , despite mel _UNK 's _UNK .

since _UNK is illegal world-wide ... ? why are n't the owners of these websites arrested immediately after they broadcast ? law enforcement agencies could easily trace where the website is been shown from , right ? do pedophiles have rights in this regard , to be free to broadcast _UNK ? such things fall under the jurisdiction of the home country of the host site , and not all countries are quite so keen on trying to bust pedophiles ( though this is starting to change ) . _UNK can get involved , but their resources are stretched rather thin with other criminal activities .

will iran take the offer or reject it ? i think iran will _UNK _UNK the west for all the money and _UNK it can get . but in the end , iran will probably accept the offer . they have nothing to lose . they can always resume their research in the future . iran may say developing nuclear capability is a part of national pride and political independence , but from our perspective , it is just _UNK . i sincerely believe that most international relations are based on faulty images of the other side . iran should know the west can not accept weapons of devastating destruction in the hands of a volatile religious theocracy . however , iran probably does n't see itself that way . on the flip side , the west probably does n't appreciate the level of national pride they pin on achieving nuclear power . for iran , it is a matter of national honor and a symbol that they are a world power . however , someone has to level with iran : they are not a stable enough country to handle nukes .

why we ca n't stop the war and being _UNK with things that god gives 2 _UNK ? war can`t stop because there was no actual reason for it to start usa destroyed the legend of saddam but she _UNK give iraqi people a role _UNK they could follow so iraqi people is looking to those who leads the country as _UNK who must be fought moreover iraqi now are _UNK each other as _UNK and _UNK and _UNK this is just killing any hope to stop that war and begining the rebuild of iraq
for men only : the _UNK down the street from me hires illegal immigrant russian _UNK , do you want ? them deported or can they stay ? sorry , i 'm not a man ... . but if you will read more into these types of situations ( and not just in the us , it 's a huge problem all over the world now ) that the majority of these women were _UNK in with the intention of keeping them against their will and making them work there . human _UNK to support the sex industry is a major problem right now . these women should be rounded up and sent home . i can guarantee you that more than half thought they were taking a different type of job ( that is the lure , a real job , not dancing naked for gross men ) they would probably welcome the authorities _UNK them and sending them home . ( many actually do )
does anybody support any type of proportional representation for us , say list pr , _UNK , the german system , etc . ? proportional representation makes it hard to pass any old piece of legislation really fast , because governments are forced to deal with other parties in order to get a majority to pass . it removes _UNK . a party getting 40 % of the vote ca n't win a majority of seats in the house even though 60 % of voters chose someone else . in the usa , i would say that single member _UNK elected using _UNK voting are good for the lower house , because if you give ( for example ) wyoming 3 seats , enough for _UNK to work , you 'd either have to make the house really big or give wyoming a _UNK amount of _UNK . you could use _UNK in the senate , no trouble , though you might need to increase the size of the senate . it would really change the way american politics works .

i 'm looking for any laws and/or _UNK animal _UNK the past to the present ? you begin with your state laws , these usually lay the foundation for the local ( county and city ) codes . for example , in my state the laws for euthanasia are set in state laws . local codes must fit within , or simply use , those state laws .
