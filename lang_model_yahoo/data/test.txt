why do christians love banning and/or burning books so much ? why is it they want to tell me what to read , watch , etc . the only books i know of that you can prove cause violence are the bible and quran , why not start there ? it is not just christians that have burned books , it was very common during the reign of the nazis in germany . i guess some people think it is far better to buy and burn something that they object to than to try to ignore it and hope it goes away . of course , i have to laugh when i hear that recently a group of people have bought books to burn them when this still gives the author the royalties to book sales and the negative publicity about the book usually give the book more interest by others , again raising sales of the book .

science & religion ( not vs ) ? can they ever _UNK ? looking at both in my opinion , i would have to say that they 're basically two different ways of understanding the same world and can sound the same in many aspects . the only differences is that religion has god ( s ) and science has the big band theory . one has religious morals and the other uses human rational . one believes in a `` higher power '' , the other believes that everthing is connected through organic means . do n't they both in a way make sense if you looked at their ultimate purpose . that being , understanding the world in which we live . therefore theoretically could they not exist under the same roof ? if not then ( again , theoretically ) what would we have to do in order to balance the scales to make them one . yes , but both sides have to open their minds , however most _UNK % of christians and _UNK dont have open minds . so unless they are willing to let their guard down , it will never happen

hence you are told to accept one god , is _UNK that there are many gods ? so is that saying there are many gods , so then there must be a civilization of gods that again proves my alien theory about gods ot that thou shalt not have no other gods before me . and , jesus said the only way to the father is through the son . i 've heard that when judaism originated , the _UNK regarded their god as their national god and recognised that other peoples had their own gods , but i 'm not sure how true that is . i do find it interesting that in genesis , when adam and eve eat the forbidden fruit , god says , `` now he has become like one of us !

how would one go about proving that their religion is the `` right '' one ? is there some sort of empirical evidence that proves one over another ? most problems in this world are created by people who want to prove that their religion or their country or their economic ideology is better than others . religion is not about 'my dad can beat up your dad ! ' it is quite opposite . those who want to prove that their religion is superior do n't know the first thing about religion . organized religions should try to be servants of humanity , not masters . christians say their _UNK was god 's only son ; jews say they are god 's chosen people ; muslims say that their prophet was god 's last prophet and all in thier holy book is the final deal ... i am sure hindus and buddhists also have some way or other to claim superiority ... .its all _UNK _UNK ... just refuse to accept superiority of any organized religion over rest of _UNK ...

where in the bible , does it talk about guardian angels ? i believe `` _UNK '' answered your question very well and they were right to reference the _UNK of the catholic church because it covers all bases including biblical references in case you are one of those that say , `` if it is n't in the bible it does n't exist . `` . you have to understand that the bible does n't always refer to some things by name , but by reference . just like there are many references to a place where souls go to be _UNK before entering heaven , even though the actual word `` _UNK '' is not mentioned . the bible was not written originally in english , so we should not _UNK over _UNK to get to truth . so it is with `` guardian angels '' . that particular english phrase is not spelled out but the references are numerous , and `` _UNK '' spelled them out clearly and beautifully . i am a catholic , too . god bless you ,

who has created god ? dont say himself . ? this is like asking , `` what does blue smell like ? '' blue is not in the category of things that have odor , so the question itself is flawed . in the same way , god is not in the category of things that are created , or come into existence , or are caused . god is _UNK and _UNK - he simply exists . how do we know this ? well , we know that from nothing , nothing comes . so if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist . but things do exist . therefore , since there could never have been absolutely nothing , something had to have always been existing . that _UNK thing is what we call god .

what is your opinion of the south african civil unions bill ? yes , now gays can register a civil union . but we still can not get married legally . is this just a _UNK of apartheid ( separate facilities for some groups ) , or should we accept the legislation ? i agree with you to a degree . first of all it is disgusting to me that south africa is so far ahead of the us in gay rights . i think the state needs to get out of the marriage business . state sanctioned unions should have always been called something other than marriage . to me marriage is a religious ritual ... .it is between me , the person i love , our community of faith and our god . why would the government need to be part of that ? civil unions grant the legal rights of a marriage and are appropriate for the state to perform . of course , in reality the state is never going to stop doing straight marriages , so we deserve nothing short of equal treatment .

do you think dan brown in some point is correct about jesus & mary magdalene ( da vinci code ) ? nope i do n't think it 's true . but it really would n't matter to me if it were . jesus could have married and had children if he chose to , that would n't shake my faith at all . where i have a problem with the da vinci code is that it is a work of fiction that many people are taking as fact ( like this board is showing ) and that it attacked the _UNK of christ . that 's the issue i have .
what is cologne and what is that used for ? i am new to this country and i do n't know much about the culture here . so , u might think this is a stupid question but i really do n't know . cologne is a _UNK liquid that one applies to his body to make him smell better . it is common in many european countries . it originated during the black plague in europe . they would put cologne and perfume on a _UNK and when they passed a deceased person , they would smell the cologne to cover the other smells nearby . now , though , culture has transformed it into a symbol of status . you smell like you are wearing expensive cologne and people treat you better . it 's all about status .

in order to _UNK believe in god ( etc ) should you have to read bible from cover to cover first ? should everyone read the entire bible before deciding if they believe it or not ? i have no answer of my own , i just wonder what people think ? i read the nt years ago and bits and pieces of the kjv recently . the more i read , the less i believed it was the right religion or path for me . so yes , i would recommend someone to read a bit of the bible ( not _UNK all ) if they are searching , so they can make a informed decision on whether jesus is to be in their lives or not . : - ) it has been my personal experience that informed decisions have more power than uninformed decisions in someone 's life . excellent question !

how is asking what `` god '' does with his left hand perverted ? the bible talks about his right hand all the time but never talks about his left hand . i just wanted to know what it does . you and i both know the answer to this . it 's not perverted . it 's that you 're questioning them about their god in a way they 've never been questioned about before , nor have questioned themselves . it 's like when i ask them if they thought god watched porn ! the reactions you 're getting are because you 're getting them to think ( and i imagine that hurts them , like sunlight does a vampire ) . of course there are implications floating around about what `` he '' does with his other divine hand while the right hand is busy ruling the universe ... personally , i think he keeps it busy while he 's watching porn .
how did slaves respond _UNK way that they were treated ? it really depends on the slave owner during that era . some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin . not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves . in fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop _UNK . continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed . i live in the south and am very proud to be southern . i never owned a slave nor did any member of my ancestors in fact my grandmother worked along side the _UNK in the cotton fields less than 50 years ago .

who knows and can explain the religion that is based on love and not selfish ambition ? 10 points for the best . there is only one i hate to call it religion cause its not its the heart . but i want to hear if people can comprehend it like i do . love god , love others as you would yourself . jesus replied that to the religious leaders when they asked what is the greatest command of all . love does not hurt , mock , gossip , judge , kill , anger or anything that would harm others . god 's true intention of the law is for us to learn what hurts each other and jesus came to fulfill it and now therefore we are under grace . if love governs our hearts , we would n't do anything that harm others . the perspective we should try is the motivation of love and not having the pressure to `` obey the law . '' love _UNK those `` laws '' god loves us regardless of what we do because he looks at the heart .

how does _UNK force work . ? _UNK force any motion in a curved path represents accelerated motion , and requires a force directed toward the center of curvature of the path . this force is called the centripetal force which means `` center seeking '' force . the force has the magnitude swinging a mass on a string requires string tension , and the mass will travel off in a _UNK straight line if the string breaks . the centripetal acceleration can be derived for the case of circular motion since the curved path at any point can be extended to a circle . note that the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the velocity , implying that a doubling of speed will require four times the centripetal force to keep the motion in a circle . if the centripetal force must be provided by friction alone on a curve , an increase in speed could lead to an unexpected _UNK if friction is insufficient .

is there a connection between the phases of the moon and earthquakes or _UNK ? yes , there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes . both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth . the moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans , affecting weight of water over portions of the earth . the moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel 's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway . of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun 's light relative to the positions of the sun , moon and earth . because the ocean tides ( and _UNK tides ) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon ) , the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel 's back .

what is the _UNK effect in simple terms ? all the previous answers are correct . however , with regards to enthalpy and entropy remember what these terms mean . while enthalpy is heat energy , entropy is ( essentially ) a universal tendency towards chaos . so , _UNK interactions decrease the total enthalpy of a system and ( according to some fundamental physics ) increase the entropy of that same system . the apparent paradox , proteins and lipids forming ordered systems ie . _UNK , is _UNK when we take into account the ordering of water around these systems . water molecules become much less ordered when _UNK components are allowed to form contacts . this is known as decreasing the _UNK shell . thus , all _UNK interactions are typically exothermic in nature and cause an increase in enthalpy of the system . hope this helps !

what are heating degree days and cooling degree days ? it 's used for _UNK fuel costs . each town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer . with those averages , you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs . you can calculate it from the average temperature each day . example : average temperature for jan. 1 is _UNK . _UNK - _UNK = _UNK jan 1 is one day , so _UNK difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days average temperature for jan. 2 is _UNK . _UNK - _UNK = _UNK jan 2 is one day , so _UNK difference * 1 day = 30 heating degree days you do this for every of the year and add it up . jan 1 = 35 heating degree days jan 2 = 30 heating degree days jan 3 = jan 4 = add it all up and you get the number of heating degree days for the winter .
how do convert _UNK _UNK to _UNK ? the answer `` _UNK and add 30 '' is incorrect . a simple way that is 100 % accurate is to double the c temperature , then subtract 1/10 of that number , then add 32 . for instance : 18 degrees c ; double that and you have 36 ; subtract 1/10 of 36 : 36 - _UNK = _UNK . now add _UNK + 32 = _UNK .
what 's capacitor ? capacitor , device for storing an electrical charge , sometimes called a condenser . in its simplest form a capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a _UNK layer called the _UNK . the _UNK may be air , plastic , _UNK paper , or another substance such as the mineral _UNK . when one plate of a capacitor is charged using a battery or other source of direct current , the other plate becomes charged with the opposite sign ; that is , positive if the original charge is negative , and negative if the original charge is positive the electrical size of a capacitor is its _UNK , that is the amount of electric charge it can hold per unit potential difference across its _UNK = _UNK . the si unit of _UNK is the _UNK ( f ) . because this is such a large unit , _UNK commonly have their size expressed in _UNK ( 1 _UNK = _UNK f ) or pf ( 1 _UNK = _UNK f ) .

do you think _UNK is still better than macbook pro ? yes and no . for the average user , the new macbook pro offers faster startup time and many applications that are designed for the new ( to apple ) intel processor that will run faster than before . this is one side of the story . many computer users choose apple for use in design projects ranging from graphics to film editing . applications like apple 's own final cut pro , motion , and non apple programs like photoshop ( macromedia ) will most likely run faster on the older _UNK _UNK because they are not written to work _UNK with intel processors . this does not mean these programs will not work on the macbook pro , they will just run slower because they require a special ( invisible ) program to allow them to run on the intel processor . for the average user , however , the macbook pro is well worth it .

can you turn off a pc at the powerpoint ? and if not - why ? i am referring to a home pc . if i closed all the running programs and logged off , then just turn the pc off using the powerpoint would this harm it ? i guess you 're saying either turn it off with the power switch or pulling the power . neither way is a recommended method . even if you 've closed all programs there are still processes running in the background in windows . doing the shut down procedure in windows is the preferred way because it stops everything and then turns it off . now sometimes it 's not _UNK such as during a _UNK but that 's the only time i would suggest doing that . over many times of shutting the machine off _UNK you will get system errors .

soccer _UNK ? why ca n't you have more than one goalie ? so ... i 've been watching the world cup . when the other team has a corner kick or a penalty shot why ca n't the defending team put a few extra players there to grab the ball . yes , it would probably be a penalty but it would save a goal . my question is ... what is the penalty if a _UNK saves the ball from going into the goal with his hands ? is it a goal ? or does the other team get a free kick ? a goal keeper is just an extra player in each game . that 's why ten players plus a keeper is eleven which is an odd number . the ten players are not supposed to touch the ball with their hands . if they do so intentionally they can get a red or yellow card . and to differentiate the players from the goalkeeper , the goalie must not wear the uniform the other players are wearing . they should put on diffrent color , long or _UNK .

why is britney spears partying so much when she 's got two little ones to care for ? it 's very simple . she cares more about partying than she does about her children . she can say whatever she likes -- that they mean the world to her . that they are the most important thing in her life . that she would do anything for them . anything that does n't interfere with her partying , obviously . that 's where she has drawn the line . behaviour is more indicative of what one feels and believes than what comes out of their mouths . leaving kids with a trusted babysitter is sometimes necessary , but each instance carries some risk . and the more frequently you leave them in somebody else 's hands , the greater the chance for something _UNK to happen to them . on second thought , in some people 's cases , their kids may be safer in other people 's care . this may be true for spears . either way , she 's probably not on the short list for `` mother of the year '' .

my best friend is my 3 year old sister . ? i desperately need help making friends . i am 12 years old and i do n't have any friends at school . i probably only had about 5 friends in my entire life , all which were the kids of my parents ' friends . i am really lonely and wish i had someone to call and talk to whenever i 'm having a problem . nobody at my school even notices me . you will grow out of this as you start to mature and grow into your self . you still dont know who you are yet . most 20 year olds dont know who they are yet or where they want to be in life . as time goes on and you start to determine which direction life is taking you , you will begin to make friends like you . give it some time . be _UNK ( probably not spelled right ) introduce yourself to people make yourself known .

how can u tell if a girl is faking or not under the sheets ? i got ta say , there is only one reason a girl fakes it ... and that is to make you feel good or feel better about yourself ... cause she is worried you have too fragile an ego to deal with the fact that she might not totally enjoy being w you . so > > > i think you got ta talk to her and somehow gain a little confidence in yourself and your ability . the problem is n't her . if she is not faking it , great . if she is , i think you got ta turn the mirror on yourself and ask why . in either case ... .she is not the issue here !

how do you have a good relationship if you are not very _UNK ? there is much more to a relationship than affection . personally i love affection , but there are those that are _UNK , and they lead healthy strong relationship . the key is the connection between the two in the relationship . if one person lives for affection and the other hates it well then that 's a recipe for disaster . then on the other hand if the person feels other things are important in the relationship like kindness or emotional support or even financial support . they the relationship will be _UNK it really boils down to the individuals in the relationship . there dozens of things that make people compatible and _UNK . affection is just one aspect ... good luck .

how many people do n't get engagement rings ? i 've heard of couples with really cheap _UNK rings or just none at all ... yes , it happens . but i 've found the `` cheap '' rings usually mean more than the expensive ones . when my husband and i got married , we were poor college students with no jobs so he could n't afford an engagement ring . on our honeymoon , we went to a small antique store and saw a beautiful ring -- it was bright green crystal set in sterling silver -- and it was $ 10 . the man we bought it from warned it was expensive . since my husband had $ 10 , he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my `` very expensive ring '' . although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor , i love that ring and will never get another one . for me , it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world .

is the separation date in a divorce important ? should it be choosen wisely and why ? what can not be done after this date ? what about retirement account money ? if taken out does it need to be payed back if used for _UNK expenses ? depending on your state , the date of separation can be important as far as responsibility for bills , and assets . if you were separated on jan 1st , and opened a charge account in feb , your partner probably would n't have to pay any part of that . as far as retirement accounts that were opened and contributed to during the marriage , they would be divided , and if any part was used , i would think that it would come out of that person 's portion . an attorney would be able to give you the exact laws for your situation .

do women have any legal rights if a man _UNK her ? _UNK her is when a man has a camera in a _UNK bag , or on his shoes , and he _UNK takes a picture up her skirt usually without her consent or awareness . i think that it is not a law against that unless there is sound on the tape . not because it is okay but because it is one of those laws that is behind the technology available to us now . i think that the police and the courts have to get the guy on some smaller charges . but i could be wrong and the law has already been changed .

why wo n't bush meet with the minutemen ? really , he knows their there . and they are a growing group . and they have asked for a meeting with him . why wo n't he ? bush , along with kennedy and mccain are the three top traitors of this country , as far as i am concerned . they could care less about the american people , especially the middle class . bush wants to give our _UNK away as fast as he can . he is a disgrace to us . i am ashamed that he is our president .

what is the level of the implementation of the _UNK protocol world wide ? _UNK is relating to the co2 emissions which countries emit , the majority of europe has signed up to this agreement but the real harmful players have not . u.s.a for instance thinks it can battle global warming with technology and will not sign up to it and china has plans to build one coal fired power station every week for the next seven years so the real effects that _UNK was intended to do will be offset by these two nations alone . i think it was a great idea and i am not a tree _UNK or anything but i do beleive that the _UNK agreement is the best way to go . the fact of the matter is that those countries which have signed up to it are not cutting their emissions by nearly enough anyway and our own government is giving it 's big companies it 's own ways to bypass their responsibilities in buying _UNK _UNK ' from other companies anyway , i can not help but think that this _UNK agreement was doomed to failure the moment it was signed

how do people get the opinion that torture is acceptable ? this should be a slam dunk . do you think torture is acceptable ? no . how do people stray from that ? do they not have an education ? are they following the example of their leaders ? how ? how is the percentage of people who think torture is okay not the same as the percentage of people who think the earth is round ? i try to teach my children to `` treat others as you want them to treat you , not the way that they do treat you '' . as far as i am concerned , two negatives only make a positive in math . therefore , torturing anyone or anything is completely unacceptable . those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured .

minutemen building their own border fence ? finally , it 's about time that someone has the _UNK to do something about the _UNK southern border . for those who do n't know , they 've gotten permission from private _UNK and are _UNK the u.s. government on this one . construction begins memorial day . i think it 's a shame that private citizens are forced to take action because president , congressman and senators are running scared of the hispanic vote . 18 % of the vote is a powerful force , but 82 % of the vote carries more weight . go minutemen go ! ! ! ! ! the minute klan is just a bunch of white _UNK and i doubt they will do anything but keep _UNK gullible people of money appealing to their racist and _UNK nature . i can respond your answer as well : the national _UNK of la raza http : _UNK is an organization to promote the civil rights of latinos , and _UNK is just a cultural student organization ... http : _UNK what is wrong with any of those organizations ! ! ?
how the global warming and the air pollution would be controlled ? global warming and _UNK are the big threat to the human existance in the _UNK future . what measure will have to be _UNK to protect the earth ? apparently you have n't seen some of the dire warnings , it 's too late to stop the greenhouse effect , we can slow it but it 's already too far gone . the greenland ice melting is expected to raise ocean levels by 3 inches in the not too distant future ... .there 's more , but i know the consequences to the _UNK are pretty severe .
who hear thinks military should get paid the most ? i do i do , they are the ones that are _UNK their butt for us and our country . they have to have huge amounts of intelligence and bust their way through military camp and pretty much any other job they have to do . they should get paid a ton of money because they are doing the hardest job for the government , they are not working for the fbi or sitting in bush 's cronies offices pushing around paperwork ; they are out there doing real life physical work and should get properly paid for it , not to mention putting their life on the line , where is their hazard pay ? ca n't get much more hazardous than that kind of job when they are getting sent off to war .
did new _UNK like mayor rudolph _UNK ? and if so , why ? i am a born & raised new _UNK , and , even after i _UNK to florida , i still considered rudy to be one of the best _UNK anywhere , even before 9/11 . he had a way of cutting through the bs and helping to get the city back on track . during the 9/11 _UNK , he was the glue that held nyc together . i do n't agree with his politics these days , but i will always be grateful for the leadership he showed in those very dark days .

anyone notice how saddam 's hair remains black and trim despite his being in jail ? i 'd bet that some of his own people are dying his hair , keeping it trimmed , and keeping his clothes clean and fresh . he looks a sight better than when he _UNK out of that spider hole , , he lives quiet well , , 3 square and a cot , , us troops do n't live as good as enemy # 2 , , , osama would be enemy # 1 , , , it 's all about his freedom , , , he does n't deserve it , , , , _UNK about 100,000 troops from iraq to go after him for the attacks of 9-11 , , , watching saddam sit on trial for crimes in what year was that , , compared to having osama brought to justice just does n't seem right
how long does it take too brain wash some one into suicide bomber ? in todays case i 'd say 13 years . _UNK began probably around 3 years of age . from 3 until today it was nothing but a _UNK of _UNK ideology and becoming a _UNK for the `` cause '' so to speak . just think there are thousands out there now just like him .

can someone get a free divorce , if their spouse is in prison for committing a felony ? i do n't know of any state that automatically gives the spouse of a convict a waiver of court costs ; however , every state does have a method for obtaining a waiver of court costs by persons who have low _UNK . check with your local court to find out what the schedule is . states do not supply attorneys to divorce _UNK , so your choice is to hire counsel , try to find free counsel , or do it yourself . most local bar associations have referral services including _UNK to attorneys who have agreed to take some cases for free or on a sliding scale .

can i make a will without an attorney in ca ? are you legally allowed to ? yes . do you have the required knowledge to do it successfully ? i ca n't answer that based on the information you 've given . the california probate code ( start with sections _UNK and read on ) cover the requirements for formal and _UNK wills . the tricky bits come when wills intersect with community property laws , and when you have complicated property ownership issues that need to be resolved . if it 's simply `` x and y get everything in equal shares '' and you 're not married , then you might be fine . otherwise , it 's probably worth getting some legal help . many schools offer legal clinics that are run by law students and _UNK by attorneys . of course , if you have a lot of property assets , it 's worth spending a little money now on a lawyer , to make sure the will is drafted correctly . a little money now could save a lot of money for your heirs if your estate is at all complicated .

if the wall is built on the border , is the government going to hire illegals to do the job ? it wo n't be built directly on the border . it will be built slightly inside the us territory . so i doubt illegals will be hired . in fact , they will _UNK it out to a _UNK _UNK and we will pay $ 50 / hour plus $ 100 per _UNK for guys to stand around and watch the one _UNK _UNK hired to build the wall . and _UNK , the border is the rio grande river . mexico _UNK it a bit . a park the us had built on the river 's edge became mexican property because the new route for the river put the park on the southern side of the river .

how did gender discrimination start ? why ? gender discrimination has always been a part of human history . even chimps display what we would consider gender discrimination . i think it most likely _UNK from the differences in male and female bodies and behaviors . males were typically stronger , more aggressive , and more _UNK in battles ( if a male died it was not such a big loss , that just meant more females to go around , but if a female died it would hurt the population - one less female to raise children . ) this put females at a disadvantage . this original disadvantage probably increased as societies became more complex , and the males began to craft policies which _UNK them , and gender discrimination was _UNK .

why the power of the national and state governments are separated into 3 branches ? the reason is to keep one branch from being too powerful . one branch making all of the branches decisions is a dictatorship . dictatorship is when one party controls the making , execution , and interpretation of the law . the `` _UNK '' idea , keeps one branch from being too powerful , and keeping one legislation from being too powerful . that is why the house of representatives , senate , and congress all work for different aspects of the government , and why they are seperated is simply to keep one legislation from ruling all aspects of the government .

is arnold _UNK ( do n't know how to write it ) gon na be the next usa president ? no , because he is not _UNK , which is a requirement to run for president . however , there was some talk awhile back about trying to pass a constitutional amendment to change that . i do n't think it would ever pass , because people would be too paranoid . i live in california , and it is true that _UNK 's approval rating is down . when he first ran for governor , i thought he should `` come out of the closet '' as a libertarian . but lately he 's been more of a republican , and even making noises like a democrat , especially in regard to public schools . i am disappointed in him .

should the tax cuts be made _UNK ? _UNK debate in congress over taxes ultimately comes down to this : who knows best how to use your money -- the politicians in washington or you ? i believe the money we spend in washington is your money , not the government 's money . i trust you to make the best decisions about what to do with your _UNK dollars , because when you do , your family is better off , our economy grows , and prosperity and opportunity spread throughout our great _UNK george w. bush _UNK yes , with tax cuts rich people open more big businesses and factories which then create more jobs . our unemployment is _UNK i believe it 's working . plus my daughter and her husband love getting 3000 back , to pay off their bills . they only make _UNK yr .
nations are being punish for crimes against man , y are n't we ? ? ? ? history repeats itself , and _UNK a witch . 1 . because the world is screwed 2 . u.s is powerful and will kick ass . why do you think no one messes with china ?
what is your reflection on what will be our organizations in the future ? organizations in the future must be involved in stopping global warming , abortion , gay marriage , nuclear arms , terrorism and other activities threatening religions , world peace and order .
bush _UNK iraq to nam , so i wonder has the iraq war made as big of a split in america as viet nam caused ? or is it just limited to thumbs and violation warfare on yahoo questions it has not reached the level that _UNK activity did during the viet nam war did but it is building . the only missing thing would be to bring back the draft and the realization that rich kids were avoiding the draft because of their father 's connection much like gw 's _UNK .
is it true that bush past a law about students not being able to upgrade student loans ? he cut $ 12 billion from the student loan program . the new budget will make it impossible to consolidate student loans . plus it raises interest rates on all student loans ( and making them fixed rate of about 2-3 % more than what students are now paying ) , and thereby raising payments on all existing loans as well . here 's lots of information : http : _UNK ? _UNK
a question to the illegal immigrants . why do you think the americans do not like you ? how would you call a person who _UNK into your house without your _UNK and what would you do in this case ? would you call to the police or give the _UNK a bed to sleep on , food to eat or maybe a job ? and the other question is how would you call a person whom you have invited to come and visit you and then they would refused to leave your house ? how would you treat them ? if you know the answers then you will be able to answer the questions why the americans do not like you . you pretty much stole this question from someone else ... and almost word for word .
would firing don rumsfeld threaten our lives and stocks ? i disagree with some of what rumsfeld has done , particularly in regard to making our military do more with less and _UNK bases ( did n't we learn anything from pearl harbor ? ) . but overall , i think he has done a good job . firing him would probably increase the threat level somewhat . who in the current administration is qualified to take his place ? ( p.s . thank you for your emailed comments . i wish there were more like you in both parties . keep up the good work ! )
how did ww1 end ? germany ran out of men and supplies , with riots at home and a communist _UNK _UNK _UNK and the german government _UNK to the allies . the _UNK empire also _UNK and was broken into smaller states . ( austria , hungary , _UNK , etc ) the turkish empire _UNK and was also _UNK .
look what my friend in _UNK have done to me . ? maybe we 've been in the rocks to long ? and look what they did to your buddy , al _UNK ... bombs _UNK ... .. : ) i wish you well.. jesse
someone tell me about welfare to work _UNK ? all of the us states run welfare programs . each state has their own rules . if you are able to work and qualify for welfare , you collect welfare while you are looking or training for employment . the welfare payments are limited to two years in my state . some people can not work and have never worked , so they do not qualify for social security . say a person is blind and confined to a wheel chair . that person will never be able to work , so he is entitled to welfare for as long as he lives , or until state laws change .
how many recognized political parties in world ? it 's hard to say . it depends what the criteria is for something to be considered a political party . and then there might be instances where two different parties go by the same name . furthermore , what about divisions in parties ? for example , in the united states , there are numerous socialist parties . would you group them all together or count them individually ?
the millennium goals ? hoax or reality ? is the united nations truly inclined to help the _UNK poverty ? or is it a hoax , to save face after it 's in capacity to protect the world from wars and terror . ? i think the un is a big waste . it seems to be run by a bunch of crooks , that in it for them selves
why dont people like president bush ? ? ? ( just wondering ) ? its probably because ( in democrats case ) they just ca n't stand having a republican who did n't go to an ivy league school from texas actually legally obtain the presidency . well , they 're also kinda rude .
so conservatives is any news source that does not agree with your _UNK automatically liberal ? do n't waste your time _UNK with them . no matter how hard you try , you 'll never be able to give them a soul or a conscience .
how can i get my sons _UNK & mohamed and my _UNK in canada , ontario , _UNK ? they left egypt sins 1991 with _UNK mother mrs , rehab _UNK _UNK by immigration services . please any one can _UNK me i am the father an d ther is no _UNK all this time do u mean they left egypt in 91 by _UNK visa with their mom or they left without u know where they going or what . and if they are in _UNK now means they r canadian citizens . and do they know about u ? u can go to _UNK or if u want i can get u the immigration phone number in canada and they should help u u can send me attach in arabic . i can read arabic
why is n't africa not getting enough attention ? hmm ... well with the war and other situation thats going on there . why is n't the united states and the u.n. not doing enough to help the people in africa . people are dying there everyday . a holocaust ! is it because it 's country full on colored people . or ... ? ? ? ? opinions please . also when oprah _UNK a show on sudan , it 's sad how other tv networks all of a sudden started making it the big news in their headlines . they should n't of been putting that in their front cover in the first place . it 's a little bit of everything you 've pointed out and then some . the good points are : ( 1 ) you are now aware , ( 2 ) you 've made an attempt at discussion , and ( 3 ) you have an opportunity to become involved . thanks for asking a thoughtful question . peace to you , little sister .
_UNK and nation building . is it dead for usa foreign policy for decades to come ? the intent for democracy in other parts of the world may have been good . name five persons who really screwed it up for ever . paul _UNK , _UNK , cheney , rumsfeld , _UNK rice . _UNK , did his best to _UNK any kind of meaningful iraqi governmental authority , _UNK , ( one of the _UNK of the _UNK game that got us into this war ) , cheney , war _UNK , lying , spreading fear and _UNK political _UNK ) , rumsfeld - war crimes , arrogant and over optimistic - advocated a campaign without an exit strategy . rice - as dishonest as she is _UNK her `` smoking gun `` _UNK was based on false assumptions at best - or our right lies . some of these neocons should be tried for war crimes .
who was the _UNK officer of the defending army during the battle of new orleans ? also , how many casualties did the defenders suffer ? andrew jackson . it was a total massacre ! the british were slaughtered . i do n't know how many brits were killed but it was in the thousands . but only 13 americans died fighting the strongest military in the world , at the time . that was actually the last battle ever fought with britain ...
is there a federal law that prohibits states from requiring factory parts for auto repairs ? i think i remember hearing about a federal regulation that prohibits individual states from requiring the use of original ( _UNK ) parts for automotive repairs . can anybody point me in the right direction as to where i can find this ? thanks . i have n't been able to find anything like that by searching the us code , and it does n't sound like something that is even within congress ' powers . that is clearly something that each state should be able to decide for itself . they would have to make an extremely hard case for it being an interstate commerce issue , and without that , it 's definitely unconstitutional .
does anyone think that the draft will be _UNK in the next 5 years ? well ? no way hoe _UNK ! we have enough people who want to be in our armed forces and they just keep on coming ! wonderful news for _UNK news for those damned arabs !
do you forget _UNK of _UNK by usa ? ? ? ? ? iranian peoples say this we do n't want nuclear weapons we want only nuclear energy we need it iran is full of oil , so really you dont need nuclear energy , you want to have a bomb , your president has _UNK stated that he will use the bomb on israel ( if not other nations too ) as soon as he gets it.. thats a first use policy . and yes _UNK was bombed but it was a different case , it really was not known how bad the results would be , and the usa was in a war with japan ( remeber that japan started ) and by dropping the bomb , millions of usa lives were saved by not having to go into japan ... _UNK the bomb then , and iran threatening to nuke israel are completely differnt things . perhaps you should really ask why iran hates israel so much , that it would kill millions of people _UNK jews , muslims and christians ! ! !
what do u think about iran and iranians ? to be honest , all i know is what i have read in the papers . i do n't think i know enough about the actual people to make an educated decision .
is n't there 1 law for the rich and another for the poor ? to me its obvious that the law was written by the rich , for the rich . even if this is untrue then the execution of the law is surely _UNK always in favour of the rich . sometimes i think there are no laws for the rich but many for the poor
if you do n't vote , do you think you have the right to criticize the government and politicians ? no because if you really cared about what was going on you would do something to change or support it and voting is a form of that . it 's available to you , it 's free , if you do n't do it you 're just lazy .
what did you make of the whole terry _UNK situation ? i would say that poor , poor woman except that she was for all _UNK and purposes dead while all that crap was _UNK around her . i think the poor woman should have been allowed to die with dignity a long time ago . i 'm quite sure that she would not have liked all the drama attached to her situation as well as those `` home movies '' that were all over the news . it was horrible to see someone made to stay alive like that when she was really not `` living '' at all . if you _UNK a thousand people i do n't think even one would say that they would have preferred to have their life prolonged when there was absolutely nothing to look forward to . i feel horrible for her husband as well as her parents , but i 'm happy for her that now she 's in a better more peaceful place .
do you feel jack _UNK got off too easy ? was his plea bargain fair to the usa and humanity ? it is fair if he delivers some of the bribe takers to the justice system . he can be very _UNK to the government in this way . there are bigger fish in the pond then jack . believe me .
i wanted to migrate to canada permanently i am not rich _UNK to spend money for migration how can i get it ? i am in srilanka my house was robbed by _UNK _UNK , i was _UNK by them if i make any complain to police you would be got killed . i did not hear them but i did make _UNK . now i am getting _UNK . this is my main cause to migrate . you could apply for political asylum .
what was hitler 's _UNK ? the german army still uses an updated version of _UNK _UNK . it fires a little bit slower that the old mg 42 but still way faster than an _UNK ( also based on _UNK )
if i had a possession of _UNK charge ( misdemeanor ) is idaho , would that _UNK me from getting an ? apartment in seattle ? not usually . they 'd have to do a background check , and even then , you 're probably ok . it 's when you get a felony that your options in life become extremely limited . you can buy a gun in many states with a misdemeanor , so you 're probably worrying a little too much when it comes to being a _UNK . heck , many landlords go by a credit check now anyway and would n't even be checking your record .
why would the supreme court make a seemingly stupid decision about _UNK domain , taking property from ... . ? a private land owner and giving it to a private corporation . how is that for the public good ? the govt . may take your property so long as it is _UNK related to a legitimate state interest . increasing a tax base is a legitimate state interest . note however , that states may _UNK more _UNK laws , not allowing the state govt to take property for private development , so if you do n't like your state 's rule then petition your state _UNK .
which countries are not better to live at than the u.s. ? not better for a short list there are many countries which are not better to live in than the us . maybe it would be easier to ask which ones are better . in this case i would say the _UNK countries , holland , switzerland , luxembourg , canada undoubtedly . maybe some other european nations too , but this could be _UNK . yes , i have been to these countries , and , especially in the case of most of the _UNK countries , i found they typically enjoyed a higher quality of life , more freedoms , a more rational justice system , and social protections which do not exist here . there are many good things about america too , but people who insist that it is the best have obviously not traveled much . likewise , people that consider it one of the worst have probably not traveled much either , because it is definitely towards the top , if not quite at the top .
can walmart save us from n. korea ? there is much pointing to the fact that we do n't want to get too heavily involved in a conflict with n korea for fear of upsetting our giant , _UNK trade partner , china . would it be possible then , to effect change in n korea by putting pressure on walmart ( who sources the vast majority of it 's goods from china ) to throw it 's weight into the fray ? this could be done by a us effort to boycott chinese made goods from walmart ( and all other stores ) whereby walmart would pass on the problem to china ( who surely does not want to lose walmart business ) who would in turn put pressure on their little communist brother to knock this nuke thing off . complicated , so i hope i 've stated it clearly . does it have any merit ? what or who is going to save this country from walmart ? ( serious question . )
i need a slogan ? ok my name is casey and i am running for class president , i need help trying to come up with slogans to put on my posters . i dont want stupid ones , ones that are catchy and people will remember ... .. please help me its appreciated casey or _UNK ? taking a cue from the election just held .
american politics ? ? what happened today in the american government . is _UNK bush not the president any more ? is there a knew president ? and now , is america democratic ? ? i 'm wondering where you are from but this is how it works . there is a system of checks and balances , so that no one has all of the power . before the election the republicans had the most people in the system that checks the presidents power , but now it has changed to democrats , who can now vote against him and limited his power . george bush will be in office until the 2008 elections .
why why why ? ? ? i live in _UNK county in _UNK virginia . my county is located in a very economically depressed _UNK . about 75 % of the people here are uneducated and there is a very large amount of african americans . the virgina state _UNK does _UNK to help us . meanwhile nova ( northern virginia ) has some of the richest people in the country , has the highest per capita income in the nation , and has the 2nd best education system in the u.s . the _UNK there is unbelievable and there is almost always a surplus of money . the virginia state government never takes that money to help us poorer counties . its almost if we dont exist . why does the _UNK only help those that already have money ? i 'm sorry the government wo n't help you . time to start helping yourself . get involved with developing your area , or even get into politics if you think that is a good way to help .
do illegals realize ? americans will no longer stand for our monies , education , and health care given to illegals . american can not even get what illegals get . god help us , but we are on a verge a a revolution , which i hope does not turn violent . finally , a good post . it 's time we stand up and take back our country . if they want to be here , the do it legal , like the millions of people who come here legally every year . god bless america ! _UNK , it 's not that _UNK citizens wo n't do it , it 's that they wo n't do it for nothing just to live on welfare like the illegals do . maybe we have some _UNK . oh yeah , i do do the work that the illegals are coming over here and doing for nothing . when i lose my job because they _UNK me , i 'll just come over and let you support me . idiot .
why do we have the freedom of speech if we have to watch what we say ? freedom of speech is the right to freely express opinions . the use of profanity , racial _UNK , or trying to stir up rebellion , such as `` we should kill all ... '' whatever group , or `` _UNK the president '' are not expressions of opinion . the use of name calling and profanity are expressions of anger and speech that _UNK rebellion is a call to action that threatens national security or the security of the people . these forms of speech are not protected .
should racial profiling be an _UNK method of police tactics ? if you were con what would be your thoughts on this topic . no , but not because of why you might think . when you profile something , you tend to miss those that do n't fit the profile . example - terrorist - if i were to profile a terrorist as a foreign born person , perhaps of african or arab decent , probably muslim , i would miss people like _UNK , _UNK , the _UNK boys , or the dc sniper . just like any other problem that you are trying to solve , you must approach it with an open mind or you will make mistakes . i want law enforcement to catch all terrorists , not just the ones that fit the profile . all law enforcement should be done with an open and fair mind to protect us all . as far as terrorism - why is it that white people are n't looked at ( _UNK ) as terrorists when they have done more terrorism than any of the middle eastern people in america ?
is driving your mustang gt _UNK , into your living room , just before christmas a crime ! ! ? i had a restraining order on me at the time and my divorce atty told me to take the _UNK to her and give it to her and she would sign the papers ! ps _UNK trying to put it under the christmas tree ! the palm beach state attorneys office didnt think it was funny ! ! ! listen to your attorney , his advise got you arrested , he did n't bond you out though did he ? _UNK . bet you did n't tell him about the _UNK did you . _UNK

trying to find inmates at the _UNK co jail in alabama ? http : _UNK try this - it 's has their book in photos as well . if you ca n't find the person , i would contact the sheriff 's office directly .
since we have the technology so that satellites can take pictures of individuals peoples homes and almost ? anybody can look up their own house online on _UNK and get a picture of their house taken by the _UNK within the past week , then why could n't we use that same technology to pinpoint where these terrorists are in iraq and just bomb those particular locations rather than having ground troops their and having american soldiers and _UNK civilians killed ? good question ... .
the id card scheme in the uk making it compulsory for all to have it in _UNK test run for 666 ? without the id cards you can not access services even if you 'll have the means to do _UNK to me that the mark of the beast 666 is being test _UNK do you think ? id card is lawful for purposes of identification but if it will serve the interest of a person or entity for unlawful actions , then its validity could be _UNK in court .
how is it that people out there know that you can not reason with terrorists ? and yet there are politicians out there still calling for diplomacy ? because _UNK think that they are smarter and more caring than the opposition , and if they are just given the chance to talk to the bad evil men then the bad evil men will not attack us any more . i fear that it will take another attack of the same size as 9/11 for the people of american to see the truth . and have the resolve to defeat the greatest evil of this generation .
it seems as if by thier actions police departments are recruiting ? officers from mental _UNK is in charge of them taking there _UNK meds it does not seem as they are doing a good job _UNK the recent murder of a 92 year old woman by police i have n't heard the story of a murdered 92 year old woman . i have heard the story about a 92 year old woman who shot three police officers , forcing them to defend themselves . in addition to your research , please work on your grammar and spelling .
why did the fbi keep files on john lennon and martin luther king jr. ? why would the fbi want to keep files on john lennon and _UNK jr. ? what kind of threat did j. edgar hoover feel that both of them might have been to our country ? or was it that they were both _UNK ' to j. edgar and the government ? i 'd bet anything that nixon thought lennon was _UNK ' he was so paranoid ! hoover had files on practically everybody . he considered everybody to be a potential communist .
_UNK continues to use the owner 's account for _UNK interest after the owner 's death . can he go to jail ? can not make a determination with information provided . need more information regarding what kind of _UNK the individual has been granted and whether or not the _UNK is keeping the money . even if the _UNK is using the interest for himself , my `` _UNK '' response would be no , that 's the purpose in having the _UNK . however , if the _UNK is in relation to the executor of a will , but the _UNK is not listed as a beneficiary , the _UNK can not touch the money for their own benefit except as outlined in the will and the laws of the state that indicate how the money can be used to offset expenses of the _UNK 's function .

how secure do you feel when voting using the _UNK voting machines ? have seen the hbo documentary : hacking democracy '' ? wake up call is n't it ? i live in minnesota . last year , legislation was passed that requires a paper copy of every vote cast . so i feel pretty secure in the knowledge that my vote will be counted accurately . only 5 states require a paper copy of every vote cast -- i think all 50 states should do the same .
prayer in the legislature ? the nebraska legislature opens every session with a prayer . they have a different preacher do this every day . one day last week the preacher included in the prayer that _UNK are guided to vote against abortion . he mentioned the millions of , `` murders , '' done in that way . he also asked god that they not allow evolution taught in public schools . some senators were _UNK . my _UNK does n't concern your stand on abortion or evolution . the question is : was this appropriate behavior ? to help you in your answer , there are certain agreements made by the _UNK of this prayer . he broke them . should he have been stoped in the middle of it ? i do n't think he should have been stopped in the middle but i do think he should n't be invited back .
toxic waste in mexico why no one care ? i email the president of mexico the arizona governor the epa organisation and i didnt received help im close to give up good luck with your work . in the u.s.a. it took us 40 years to get laws passed to stop corporations from poisoning americans . now the republicans in congress have un did all that work and returned to pollution as usual . we have kids in my city that have cancer from waste dumps , the epa does nothing , the government does nothing . corporations love to _UNK and let tax payers pay the bill to clean up the mess they make . please read `` silent spring '' by rachel carson . i got it at the library . one of the reasons us manufacturing went to mexico is no pollution laws there . if i can help let me know , leave comments at the link below .

i think i 'm being affected by pity ? i 'm not sure what 's bringing it about , but i 'm starting to feel _UNK towards republicans , not their policies , but the people and the party itself . i see democrats simultaneously _UNK and calling for unity which looks so _UNK , even though i know they are right to call for unity regardless of how they may be acting as winners . what do you think ? i voted republican twice . not because i was republican but because the democrats kept doing far left crap with such org 's as _UNK , or peta or other far left organizations . the democrats kept putting a none leader as their presidential _UNK look at _UNK ! he 's scary . i wish i had a government with real leadership ability who actually cared for the people rather than economically raping the people
do you agree ? i think laws should be for one purpose . to protect one person from another . some laws are designed to protect you from yourself , some laws are very pointless designed to gain state revenue . it 's getting crazy . we are not land of the free , look at all the rules we have to follow , if you can find and understand them , or maybe a police officer will inform you of it as your getting a ticket . i agree too and i am largely a libertarian which i guess you are too .
why is saddam not killed by the us army ? i wish i knew . i think it has something to do with showing the iraqi people that they are in charge of their destiny
did you see the numbers for the _UNK poll ? ? people were asked `` if you had to base your vote in november on one issue , what would be the deciding factor for you '' ? ? to which , _UNK % of the people , voted that illegal immigration , would be their top concern ! ! ! illegal aliens are my top concern . the war in iraq , no big deal , illegal mexicans stealing stuff and destroying other stuff , yeah , big deal . anything other than complete deportation for illegals is considered _UNK , and i do not support anyone who supports _UNK , as it gives them a reward for being a criminal .
what does the the abbreviations in case laws citation means ? when citing from case laws , what does these abbreviations ( 60 _UNK _UNK . 1 , 131 _UNK etc . ) stand for ? usually the first number is the volume number of the california _UNK court third division supplement ( cal . app . 3d _UNK . ) and 1 is the page number or i may have gotten it the wrong way up - 1st number is page number and last one is volume . also found in page 131 of the california reporter .

i have a question about suicide ? if someone was diagnosed with a terminal illness , should that person ( _UNK ) have the right to choose the end his / her own life ? in oregon and the netherlands , there is this thing called `` assisted suicide '' . in those 2 places , the person has this choice to ask a doctor for a pill . then he/she takes the pill that will kill him/her . it is `` assisted suicide '' because the doctor assists the patient to suicide by giving that patient a prescription of a `` death pill . '' i actually think that a person should not have the right to end his/her life . why ? because when people are ill they can feel like they want to die at that moment . but if they did not give up and survived , later on , they would realize that they were glad that they did not die . so , my answer would be no .
what does `` criminal summons issued '' mean ? it is an order by the court of jurisdiction to appear before that court at the date and time specified . it is sent instead of having a law enforcement officer arrest you . by showing up as ordered it will look better for you and will save you a day or two in the county jail . however , if you fail to appear an arrest warrant will be issued and you will go to jail , possibly needing a bail bond to get released . suggestion ... ... _UNK up !
do dems need to provide a solution to bush 's invasion of iraq ? is it the dems responsibility to fix the intentional `` mistake '' , or is it _UNK that they do in congress . ultimately all they can do is advise ... the president is still the _UNK ( commander in chief ) so look for little to change other than casualties rising .

is bill clinton smarter than george w bush coz both were born in 1946 but clinton became the p first ? neutral answers + bush had a greater parental background than clinton no , clinton is not smarter than bush because he became president first . he is smarter than bush because he actually made use of his brain and have an intellectual curiosity that bush does not have or care for . he actually reads the stuff the intelligence community gives him and ask intelligent questions , unlike bush who takes every word that is fed to him as gospel .
